When the communists took over, they abolished capitalism, and instead of selling chains the factory sent their production to the government to distribute, and were rewarded based on their production quotas set by the bureaucrats in Moscow. 

However, the bureaucrats had little knowledge of what was needed or how to measure productivity, and their quotas were unreasonable so the factory manager had to get creative to complete the orders. When Moscow set quotas by quantity, they churned out hundreds of thousands of tiny, two-link chains. When Moscow realized this was not useful and set a quota by weight instead, they started building giant chains with each link weighing several pounds. Realizing this wasn't working, Moscow set a new quota based on market value. That's when the factory started producing solid-gold chains.",The Soviet chain factory,9

They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.

Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.

It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.

Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.",Watch for bears this weekend,6

What do you know, there is a great big picture line. So they wait and wait and finally get their picture together. They are the perfect couple!

After the pictures he asks her to dance. So there they are dancing, slow songs, fast songs, it doesn't matter. After a while, he is feeling parched, and figures she must be as well. He asks her if he could grab a drink for her and she accepts. So he walks over to the punch bowl and what do you know? 

There is no punchline.",High School Crush,6

Unable to separate them, and perplexed as to what to do next, although it was very late at night, she called her vet, who answered in a very grumpy voice.

After she explained the problem to him, the vet said, ""Hang up the phone and place it down alongside the dogs.  I will then call you back and the noise of the ringing will make the male lose his erection and he will be able to withdraw.""

Therefore, they decided to stop the carnage and solve the dispute in an ancient way: a duel! As between David and Goliath. And this ""duel"" should be a dog fight ...
The mediators agreed that each party is given 5 years to grow the best fighting dog that they can. The dog that wins will deserve for its people the right to lead on this disputed land, and the losing side will have to lay down arms in an amicable way.

The Arabs found the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers in the world. They crossed them, and then crossed their puppies with the worst Siberian wolves. They chose only the largest and most powerful puppy of all litters, fed it with the best food, used steroids and found the best trainers to create the best ""killing machine"".

5 years later. The Arabs had a dog that needed steel prison bars for the cage! Only an expert coach could handle this extremely terrible and ferocious monster.

When the day of the big dog fight came, the Israelis appeared with a very strange looking animal. It was a terribly disproportionate dachshund, 3 meters long!

Every spectator in the arena felt pity for the Israelis. Nobody seriously thought that this strange, incomprehensible animal has at least one chance to stand against the snarling monster sitting on the chain in the Arab camp. All totes predicted that the Arabian dog would defeat Israel in a matter of seconds.

When the cells were opened, the dachshund slowly hobbled to the center of the circle. The Arabian dog jumped out of the cage and, splashing saliva, rushed to the giant strange dog of the Israelis. When the Arabian dog was in inches from the Israeli dog, the dachshund opened its mouth and ... swallowed the Arab monster in one sitting! Nothing left, well, maybe, except for a tiny scrap of wool from the tail of an Arab dog ...

The dumbfounded crowd of international observers, brokers and journalists published a general cry of unbelief and surprise. Everyone was confused.

The Arabs approached the Israelites, muttering and shaking their heads, stricken. ""We do not understand,"" said their leader. ""Our best scientists worked without rest for 5 years, crossed the worst, the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers with Siberian wolves, brought an incredible"" killing machine ""from the dog! .. But how?!. .. ""

 He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. 

The man was perfectly fine. 

Well, at the time, there was an old france law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of  execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

""Okay."" She replies.

""If I can tell what color panties you have on, you have to give me your number.""

She laughs but agrees.

While they're dancing the man looks down at his shoe and sees a purple reflection.

""Purple!"" He shouts. 

She jumps back bewildered. ""How on Earth did you know?""

""A gentleman never reveals his secrets.""

He hands her a piece of paper and a pen. She writes down her number and hands it back to him.

The man then moves on to stunning a brunette, and asks her for a dance.

Again, he asks her ""How about a bet?""

""What kind of bet?"" She asks

""If I can tell what color panties you have on, you have to give me your number.""

She rolls her eyes but agrees.

While their dancing the man looks down at his shoe and sees a green reflection.

""Green!"" He shouts.

The brunette laughs and takes out her own pen and paper. She happily writes her number down and stuffs it in the man's front pocket.

The man, feeling cocky now, makes his way over to the most gorgeous woman in the club, a fiery redhead. He asks her to dance and she gladly obliges.

After a while of dancing he looks down at his shoe and lets out a shriek.

The redhead asks him ""What's wrong?""

""Please tell me you're not wearing any underwear!"" He asks her.

""No, why?""

The next day, he accidentally rammed into the wall, biting on the paint. He then dissolved into a sentient puddle, able to cover the places he moved around in paint.

""Whoa!"" he said, changing out of that form. He rushed over to bite a metal pole, which granted him iron skin. 

For the next 15 years, he continued to bite more and more objects and animals, making him one of the most powerful beings in the world.

*****

One day, Frank(which was his name), set out on yet another day of his reign of terror. He had decided as such: to eradicate the Resistance, which sought to overthrow him.

""Pfft."" He said, waving his hand at his face. Dust was floating about, getting into his nose and eyes.

Raising his hand, he amplified his voice(having bitten a megaphone), proclaiming that ""The Resistance"" must come out at this second.

Suddenly, a rain of gunfire came upon him. He merely touched his chest, rendering him invincible to physical damage. Of course, his only weakness were cars, but of course no one knew about that. His ban on automobiles had only made his people think higher of him.

Soon, the pests retreated. 

Frank, his eyes burning wih the hatred of a thousand flames, morphed into a ball of invisible gas(of course, it took awhile since he could only bite dry ice), and gave chase.

He soon found their hideout, poorly hidden within the forest.

There was a young boy, looking of age 9, sprinting into the dilapidated dome.

Changing into his human form, he amplified his voice yet again, calling the Resistance out. 

At this moment, he heard... revving?

Paralysed by fear, he realised what was coming.

The white Porsche sped down towards him through the jungle road, seconds away from impact.

Desperate, he opened his mouth, attempting to bite it as a last ditch attempt.

Instead, he bit the dust.",A man went to the wishing well.,13

Being so tired from his work, he decided to take a break and watch some of the latest news. He flipped through a few channels to find the news channel. The reporters live on TV were having a massive debate over the latest election. The man wondered ""what's all the big deal about the election? I mean, isn't Cook the obvious winner of the election? He's been winning since day one.""
  
The man continued watching, waiting to see what the vote count was. Of course, he had already voted for Cook. Ballmer was definitely not winning this one. As the votes appeared on screen, he was blown away. the votes were tied down to the number, and there was nobody else left in the country to vote.
  
""Come on, I can't wait for this! It's going to take months just to get this sorted out.""
  
The man walked back to his design table and took a long hard look at his creation, shining in the light. Suddenly, an idea hit him. This would be the perfect test drive for his new time machine. Excited, the man prepared himself to visit the future.
  
Five hours later, he was ready. He strapped into the chamber and hit the button.
  
Time whizzing past the man, he was curious about the election and what would happen. He was really hoping for Cook to win, as Ballmer was in his eyes, a complete idiot.
  
A few minutes later, the machine completed its journey. Excited to see the future, the man jumped out and look a look around. His home was pretty much the same, but...
  
He looked around the room to find his light switches to be...motion activated? And the doors were all opened by shining a certain flashlight he found on his table into these smooth plastic pads. Confused, the man went outside. Everything seemed like his home. It was all seemingly normal until you looked at it for a bit. Trees grew wide and not tall, and clouds were - vertical?
  
The man was relieved to find that his car was mostly the same, but he had to use that same flashlight like device to get it to start.
Driving to the nearest Mall-Mart, he went up to the nearest cashier and asked for the time and date. To his surprise, it actually *was* 3 months later. He rushed back home and turned on to the same news channel.

We proceeded a little further and the mule stumbled again. Once more my wife quietly said, “That's twice.”

We hadn't gone a half-mile when the mule stumbled the third time. My wife quietly removed a revolver from her purse and shot the mule dead. 

I started an angry protest over her treatment of the mule, when she looked at me, and quietly said, “That's once.”",A couple was celebrating their golden wedding anniversary.,124

It was crucial to him that everyone, for all time, knew each of his products was made by his hand. From his Battle Ax of Unparalleled Sharpness to his Frying Pan of Heat Conduction, his products were named, engraved and stamped.


One day, his grandmother complained that her door didn't seal well. During heavy storms, water flowing past the door would leak into her home. He immediately identified a solution, designing and building an elaborate hinge that would keep the door flush with the wall. He wasn't used to working with such small, intricate pieces, but for his dear grandmother he made an exception. Immensely proud of it, he carefully engraved a name, but alas, there was no surface large enough for his trademark seal. History would never know this exceptional workmanship was done by his hand.


He fell into a deep melancholy. He couldn't eat or sleep. He grew fearful that his hinge would ultimately be lost or stolen, and someone else would claim credit for his work. He refused to let anyone even see it. His grandmother, worried about the dramatic change in behavior, called a psychologist for help. After extensive interviews and trust building, the psychologist was finally allowed to view the hinge. He immediately called the grandmother,

Much to his astonishment, the inside has changed to that of an old American Western saloon. The patrons are all outfitted in period costume, there's a poker table running a game towards the back, and a slick musician is hammering out a honky-tonk tune on an upright piano.

Stepping out of the pub, he's in modern-day England again. The air is thick with fog, people on cell phones brushing past him, and a cab sounding its horn at traffic in the street.

He walks back in and finds the pub is still a saloon. Even his clothes have magically changed to match the setting. The Englishman takes it in stride, first sauntering over to the poker table. He finds a seat open and manages to win a few hands. The players comment to him, in thick Western accents ""Boy, you got a future in this game. C'mon back any time!""

Enthralled, the Englishman cashes in his winnings at the bar. The bartender, a beautiful woman named Annabelle, congratulates him and asks the stranger more about himself.

""Well, you wouldn't believe it,"" starts the Englishman, ""but I've just come from London, England, about 150 years in your future.""

The bartender is impressed. ""Well I dunno 'bout that,"" she says, ""but yer a fine player, mister. This one's on the house."" She winks at the Englishman as she pours him a whiskey. As she makes her way back to the other end of the bar, the Englishman stares longingly at her.

Just then, an intimidating brute of a man approaches him. This guy has ""trouble"" written all over him: gleaming silver pistols, black suit and hat, and a grizzled beard. In a low voice, he threatens the Englishman.

""Now look here, English,"" he rumbles, ""I reckon I saw you cheatin' at that poker game. Now I see you makin' eyes at my Annabelle. She's *mah* girl, hear? I'm a-warning you.""

The Englishman can scarcely believe it. It's as if he walked into a film! Empowered by the unusually strong whiskey, he stares right back at the brute and says ""Oi! Big talk from a little man. I don't like people bossin' me around and calling me a cheat.""

To the Englishman's surprise, the brute shrinks back, removing his hat and cowering with knocked knees. ""Whoa, OK mister! I don't want no trouble.""

The Englishman is encouraged. ""I could tell from the way you walked up that you were yellow. You couldn't teach a hen to cluck! Your horse is ugly!"" The Englishman started reciting every insult he'd ever heard in a Western, every line causing the brute to take a step backwards in submission.

With his closing statement, the Englishman snatches the brute's hat right out of his hands, throws it to the ground, and stamps on it with his boot.

The brute is near tears. ""OK, mister, I-I think I might ha' done you wrong. You ain't no cheat, and you can have Annabelle.""

The Englishman feels a little bad, so he says to the brute, ""Now why don't we settle this over a drink?"" The brute accepts, and the whole saloon goes up in cheers and hollers. The Englishman then announces ""A round of drinks on me!"" Another great cheer comes up from the saloon. Annabelle the bartender comes back with a great smile on her pretty face.

""Yer all right, mister!"" she says. ""Hey Billy!"" she shouts to the piano player, ""Why don't you play somethin' for ol' English, here?""

Billy shrugs and says ""Well, I don't rightly know many English ditties, but here goes,"" and breaks into a jaunty rendition of ""London Bridge is Falling Down.""

The brute, having regained his composure, takes a seat next to the Englishman while Annabelle pours them both a whiskey.

""Say, mister,"" says the brute, ""there's something I've always wanted to know: What does the London Bridge cross over, anyways?""

""That's easy,"" says the Englishman, ""London Bridge spans the River Thames.""

**WHAM!** The next thing the Englishman knows, he's in a pile on the floor.

""Mister,"" the brute says, ""you can insult me, insult my horse, step on my hat, cheat at my game, and steal away my girl. But '*Thames*' is fightin' words!""",An Englishman walks into a Western saloon,0

The sweetest swing I’ve ever made. And it’s flying straight and true, right along the line I wanted … and it hits a bird in mid-flight!”
 
“Oh my!” commiserated the Mother Superior. “How unfortunate! But surely that didn’t make you blaspheme, Sister!”
 
“No, that wasn’t it,” admitted the Sister. “While I was still trying to fathom what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and runs off down the fairway!”
 
“Oh, that would have made me blaspheme!” sympathized the Mother Superior.
 
“But I didn’t, Mother!” sobbed the Sister. “And I was so proud of myself! And while I was pondering whether this was a sign from God, this hawk swoops out of the sky and grabs the squirrel and flies off, with my ball still clutched in his paws!”
 
“So that’s when you cursed,” said the Mother Superior with a knowing smile.
 
“Nope, that wasn’t it either,” cried the Sister, anguished, “because as the hawk started to fly out of sight, the squirrel started struggling, and the hawk dropped him right there on the green, and the ball popped out of his paws and rolled to about 18 inches from the cup!”

The chief approached them.

""You three have trespassed in our land. However, it is clear you are not from an opposing tribe, so we will let you choose either death or bunga-bunga.""

""What is bunga-bunga?"" Questioned the second captured man.

Without hesitation, the first captured man exclaimed, ""I choose bunga-bunga!""

The tribesmen opened the cage and took the man out. 

They took off his clothes and 5 tribesmen proceeded to butt-fuck him.

After the 5th tribesman finished, they gave the man water and pointed him to where he needed to go.

The second man thought for a moment, figuring getting butt-fucked 5 times wasn't too bad, he stated, ""I choose bunga-bunga as well.""

So, the tribesman took the second man from the cage and took off his clothes. 

50 tribesman proceeded to butt-fuck the second man.

The man was so sore, the tribesman had to give him a wheelchair and help him to the next village.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played 'Amazing Grace,' the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept; we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen nothin' like that before and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""

One day, while visiting the countryside where he was quite popular, he spotted an immensely pretty, dazzling, drop dead gorgeous, bombshell of a country belle, not more than 18 years age with body like an hourglass filled with molten gold, working at a nearby farm. Completely smitten, he lost his senses and fell for her head over heels, all the while outwardly maintaining his high breeding. He could not take his eyes off her, which caused those near to understand the things going through his mind. 

Once home he started to think of her. He dreamed of her. He wanted her. Badly. He reminded himself that he was 60, married to an equally beautiful wife (well, during her better days), and that the girl herself was younger than his own children. 

But the darts of Cupid were unbearably sharp. He could not get a bit of rest during day or a wink of sleep at night. He emptied bottles of lager, rum and other good liquor. He in fact emptied whatever he could lay his hands on. Thinking of her every moment he ate little and appeared flustered. His wife, very worried about him, enquired after him. He would blame it on the roasted duck he’d had the other day in the countryside at the community chief’s place which was in fact the best he ever had or he’d say it’s the weather, which was otherwise pretty good.

He burned by thoughts of her howsoever hard he tried to avoid them. He could take it no more. He gave in.

Setting aside all chivalry and forgetting his high breeding Mr. Harold James Blessing approached the community chief one day and confided in. The chief, who was also his good friend, eager to please him arranged for a meeting with the dazzling beauty - that very night at his own place!! To make sure that nobody recognised him, he dressed up like a local per advice of the chief and waited there till night.

Night came and at last he had the girl of angelic features presented to him who in turn was equally pleased to oblige him. He then unleashed his pent up true Brit horse power. Age did not seem have any effect on him. He did everything properly. He did the missionary, the doggy, the 69, the pile-driver, the on-top, the seventh and many more. He ensured bilateral satisfaction till the very end. He prepared to leave finally not before thanking the community chief for the never before experience. 

As he was leaving in the pitch dark, the dogs in the hood caught scent of him and suddenly started to growl and bark. Mr. Harold James Blessing who was walking slowly got scared and started running. The dogs that were barking started to give him chase.

He tried to run fast but he could not, he was bit weakened by the lovely encounter that he’d just had. The dogs caught up to him finally and surrounded him barking loudly. Hearing the loud noises and suspecting robbers the community woke up and everybody came out of their houses with sticks and machetes in hand. The guy in the lead approached the scared stranger lying in the dirt and lowered the torch in his hand to check who the fuck it was. “Who’s that, Roy” someone asked. The guy replied, “Blessing in disguise”.

He calls his 3 bravest warriors, Soaring Eagle, Running Water, and Falling Rocks. He tells them to go on a vision quest, and to find their spirit animal. Whoever can come back to the village and relay their story of their vision quest will be selected as tribe leader. 

Soaring Eagle decides to go to the edge of the biggest cliff. He walks for days and comes close to dehydration. He reaches the edge of the cliff, sees the horizon, but cannot find his spirit animal. Defeated, he returns to the village, and tells the chief that he could not complete his vision quest. 

Running Water decides to go to the edge of the river. He sees salmon swimming upstream in the rough, turbulent water. He is able to capture enough fish with his bare hands to survive for weeks. He enjoys the tranquility of the river, but still cannot find his spirit animal either. Heartbroken, he returns to the village. He tells the chief that he could not complete his vision quest. 

The chief is worried about Falling Rocks, since that is actually his only son. He asks Soaring Eagle and Running Water where his son may have traveled to. They tell him that Falling Rocks was going to the highest mountain known to the tribe. The chief decides to move the entire tribe to the base of the mountain and conduct a search party for him. Years pass and the chief must accept that his son will never be found. He instructs his tribe members to always be on the lookout for him. 

And that's why on the bottom of every mountain there's a sign that says Watch For Falling Rocks! ",Falling Rocks,1

With no other options, he turns to the sky and pleads “Please God, if you let me out of this, I swear I’ll never drink again”. Immediately after he says this, his foot gets a little loose, but he is still stuck. With his hope renewed, he says “God, if you let me out of this, I promise I’ll never lie again.” Now his foot is almost completely free, but the man still can’t get out of the track. Meanwhile, the train is coming closer and closer. “God, if you let me out of this, I swear I’ll never cheat on my wife.” Suddenly his foot his free and he manages to avoid the train a mere second before it passes him. He then turns to the sky again and says “Thanks anyway God, but I managed to get out on my own.”  ",A man was walking home,6

However, Arthur stops coming after some time. Gladys asks around and finds out that he's been spending the nights with Gertrude lately.

Feeling quite betrayed, she confronts Arthur and demands an explanation.

Gladys: I don't understand Arthur, is it because she's younger than me?

Arthur: No actually, I'm pretty sure she's older

Gladys: Well is she more interesting?

Arthur: No actually she's quite senile and doesn't remember much

Gladys: Then I just don't understand! What does Gertrude have that I don't!?

post,6jvhl7,2qh72,jokes,false,1498595054,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6jvhl7/mr_smith_a_very_wealthy_man/,self.jokes,,"Mr. Smith, a very wealthy man, is in town on business and towards the end of his trip he decides to take a walk on the docks and take in the ocean view.

As he's walking he comes up on a young boy, maybe 12 years old, crying on the edge of the dock. 

Mr. Smith hesitates but decides to ask what's wrong.

""Excuse me, Son? Why are you crying?"" He asks gently.

The boy wipes away his tears and replies, ""Oh, there's just a lot of things going wrong in my life right now. I'm sorry if I bothered you.""

Mr. Smith takes note of the boy's politeness, ""Is there anything I can do to help? Why don't you tell me what's going on...""

With that the boy breaks down and sobs. 

He starts going on and on about his troubles. 

His mother is dying of cancer and can't work. 

They can't afford the medicine to manage her symptoms. 

They haven't eaten in days. 

Not even an hour ago the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a restaurant for food and was caned by the owner. 

He tried to go home to his mother but when he got there he saw an eviction notice on the door and he just couldn't bring himself to go inside and give her the news. 

Everything was just falling apart and he couldn't take it.

 ""So I came here and just cried,"" he finished.

Mr. Smith was shocked. 

Of all the people he could have encountered he encountered this boy. 

He could solve this boy's problems with a single check. 

But Mr. Smith was a firm believer in earning what you got no matter what it was. 

As the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to the water...

""Son,"" Mr. Smith began, ""What's your name?""

""My name is Johnny."" The boy said.

""Johnny, you see that ship out there,"" he said gesturing to a ship about a mile out from the dock, ""I'll make you a deal. If you can swim out to that ship, climb up the mast and wave to me I will write you a check for one million dollars.""

Johnny was awestruck. ""You really mean it?""

""Absolutely."" Mr. Smith confirmed.

Johnny dove into the water without a word and swam like a madman. 

Mr. Smith watched with a smile on his face but his smile faded when Johnny turned around and came back. 

When Johnny reached the dock he explained he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn't make it.

""Well that's ok, Johnny. Tomorrow let's meet here, same time, and you can try again.""

The next day they met and Johnny tried but once again he got fatigued and had to turn back. 

Mr. Smith asked him if he'd eaten anything and Johnny told him he hadn't. 

With that, Mr. Smith gave him some money for a small meal and told him tomorrow was his last day in town so if he was going to succeed it had to be then.

The next day Mr. Smith arrived and Johnny was waiting at the dock with a smile on his face. ""You all fed and ready?"" Mr. Smith asked.

""Yes, Sir"" said Johnny. 

And Johnny dove into the water. 

This time he was swimming a bit slower. 

He seemed to be pacing himself.
Mr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further and his smile grew and grew. 

What a perfect end to a perfect trip. 

He was going to make a difference in this boy's life.

Johnny made it to the ship. 

Mr. Smith watched him climb up the mast. 

Johnny held on with one hand and reached the other out and started to wave victoriously but suddenly he lost his grip! 

Johnny slipped and fell from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below with a loud thud that echoed in the distance...

But Johnny was ok, know why?

The large room has people sitting at tables, at the counter on stools, and a bartender. So the man goes and sits down at the counter, and looks around. Everyone has a glass of water, and are usually chatting with other people.

The bartender, a heavyset man with a grimy nametag with ""Dave"" printed on it comes over and tiredly asks the man if he wants to see today's menu. The man takes a copy, and without looking at it orders a soft drink. Nearby patrons look at him for a moment, then go back to contemplating their waters.

Dave delivers the soft drink, accompanied by a fly. When the man gets the soft drink, the fly stays by it. Unfazed, the man drinks the soft drink. It is a bit flat and tastes off, but it will do for now.

The man contemplates the soft drink and the fly flies overhead as patrons occasionally come over to talk to the man. Some tell him to look at the menu, overs that he should catch the fly, some just saying nonsense.

As his drink's good enough for now, the man considers the second group. That fly was really annoying him now, and that annoyance spread to the quality of the drink itself. Why was it so off? Why did there seem to be a fly only over him?

Eventually, the man had had enough, and got the fly. This success sparked a thought in the man's head, and he finished the soft drink, let the fly go, and ordered a water instead after studying the menu thoroughly.

[This is a meta post. All craftsdwarfship is of shoddy quality.](#s)

[The 'man' is a new person to Reddit. The street he walks, the front page.](#s)

[The bar is r/Jokes, and the menu is the joke. People who get the joke ordered water, and are circlejerking in the comments with other redditors.](#s)

[The bartender, Dave is a reposted joke, which servers the r/Jokes community well. The man doesn't get the joke, and is left with dissatisfaction. Other redditors look at his post with an incorrect conclusion, then move on with their life.](#s)

[So the man deals with it for a while, and someone else comments about the joke going over his head. Some try to retell him the joke to circlejerk with him, others try to explain the joke for him or help him get to understand the joke.](#s)

All he can think about is how he has to marry her, no he is going to marry her. He strikes a conversation with her and they hit it off. They leave the bar and as they're walking out she gives him her number.

They had fallen in love, they tried to see each other almost every day; to the point where they decided to move in together. They bought a beautiful house, three bedrooms and two bathrooms, right along the coastline shore.

One night the man took the beautiful woman out to dinner on a steamboat cruise. It was there that he finally proposed, and they got married a month later at a church hill.

Nine months later they had their first child, and decided to name him Luigi. Luigi was their everything, they just knew that as long as they kept him on the right track everything would turn out for the better.

Though unfortunately only two months after, Luigi was stabbed by an american psycho. The police apprehended the murderer, and later told the couple that they've been hunting this man for 15 years, and that his nickname was the ""Baby Stabber"". Though that didn't help that their only son, Luigi, had died.

The man was sad, but knew that his wife was only feeling worse. She loved Luigi, and just wanted to see a great future with him in their lives. So the man decided to take a break from his job as a robotic engineer and make the unthinkable. He built a robotic version of their dead son, Luigi. It took him three months, but he developed a robotic baby, that would be able to grow up to the age of five, after that he'd have to develop a new body for their child. The robot had the exact brain of their deceased baby, Luigi. Though something bothered the man that possibly it wasn't finished, though he knew his wife wasn't feeling emotionally stable and needed a fix now.

So he rushed home and presented the robotic baby the wife. As a result she was horrified, she screamed saying 

""That can't replace what's already gone!"" 

They walked out of the room, and the husband calmed her down. He told her,

""That's not the original, but we both still wanna see a future with our son don't we?""

She decided that they would keep the robot child and see how it would turn out.

Though the robotic baby didn't take kindly to the woman's little burst, in fact it felt angered. The robotic baby quickly went into a terminator state, it's arm became a shot gun and leg became a sword (which looked kinda weird on a tiny robot baby btw). It began to hover, and shot the wife without any signs of remorse. It stared at the man and screamed,

""WHY DID YOU CREATE ME I'M A MONSTER!""

It stabbed the man once in the leg, the man replied, 

""I created you because we loved you and couldn't miss a day without you!""

The baby was confused,

""Love, what is... love?"" The baby pointed it's shotgun at the man.

""Baby don't hurt me, no more.""",A man walks in a bar,0

""What's wrong?""  Asks one of the women

""What's going on?""

""Well to be honest, I haven't had sex in a while""

""And why not?  You're definitely not bad looking""

""Well....I'm kind've ashamed to say."" Says the stressed out friend

""Nonsense!"" says the other friend ""maybe I can help you out""

"" Ok.....the reason i haven't had any in a while is because my pussy smells like a rotten onion and it's embarrassing when I see a guy get grossed out by the smell""

""Well that something I haven't heard before, but you know what?  Let me see what I can do then I'll get back to you""

A couple days later the friend calls the stinky pussy friend back all excited ""Guess what?, I found the perfect guy for you to have sex with!""

""How?, why!?""  

""It's a guy that has no sense of smell, so your stinky pussy is not a problem!""

""Awesome!!"" Says the stinky pussy friend ""set up the date""

A few days later the couple go out for a quick dinner and then head back to her place to handle business.  They're making out when the guy decides to go down on her.

All of a sudden he stops and says to her

""You're pussy smells like an onion!""

It startled the friend a bit ""oh my god I though you didn't have a sense of smell how do you know?
