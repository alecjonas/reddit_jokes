I went in to buy a packet of condoms at Parchen's pharmacy. In those days it took a lot of guts to go in a store and ask for that kind of item because everyone in town knew me and there was no doubt the young lady (I think her name was Nola) knew what they were for.

She was working as an assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was really embarrassed by the whole procedure. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one.

I honestly answered, 'No, not really.'

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure

I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was. 'Just a minute,' she said, and walked me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'Do these excite you?' She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. 'Well, come on', she said, 'We don't have much time.'

So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful that, unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. 'Did you put that condom on?' she asked. I said, 'sure did,' and held up my thumb to show her.

Then she beat the shit out of me....

The cop gives him a skeptical look and says, ""Were you the one being robbed?"" 

The man casually replies, ""No, I committed the robbery."" 

The cop looks shocked that the man admitted this. ""So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"" 

""Yes,"" the man calmly says. ""I have the loot in the back."" 

The cop begins to get angry. ""Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me."" The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man. 

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says. 

The cop calls for backup. Soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. The man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. However, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""Sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However, we found none of these things in your car.""

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""

The husband went to the reservation and saw the medicine man. The old Indian gave him a potion and with a grip on his shoulder warned, ""This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say: ""1-2-3.' When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life and you can perform for as long as you want.""

The man thanked the old Indian, and as he walked away, he turned and asked:  How do I stop the medicine from working?""

""Your partner must say 1-2-3-4,' he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""

He was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.  When she came in, he took off his clothes and said: ""1-2-3!""   Immediately, he was the manliest of men.

His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes and then she asked: ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

Almost as if providence struck, the Pope turned to the man and said, ""Excuse me, but do you know a four letter word referring to a woman that ends in 'unt'?""

The three Cardinals behind, in front of and beside him shrunk down in their seats, as far as possible, all looking for
something on the floor. 

The gentleman was in morbid shock.

He couldn’t breathe. 

He went within himself, thought deeper, longer for a plausible answer and after almost a minute, the dark clouds of evil parted in his mind and the sun shone in. 

Turning to the Pope, the gentleman said with reverence and politeness, ""I believe, Your Holiness, that you're looking for the word, 'aunt.'"" 

""Of course!"" the Pope mused, not taking his gaze off the crossword. ""You wouldn’t happen to have an eraser, would you?""",A guy was boarding a plane when he heard that the Pope was on the same flight...,2295

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ""No, this is my first time.""

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

""Just a minute,"" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these excite you?"" She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

""Well, come on,"" she said, ""We don’t have much time."" So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ""Did you put that condom on?"" she asked.

I said, ""I sure did,"" and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.",Buying my first condom.,1

Eventually he came upon a small village and decided to build a church and teach people of Jesus. After church was over on Sunday a homeless man walked up and asked ""Father, may I have a half lemon?"" the priest, being the good man he is, went in the building, cut a lemon in half, and brought half back to the man. ""Thank you, Father"" the man said

The priests curiosity was now piqued so he asked the homeless man ""Why did you ask me for half a lemon, my child?"" the homeless man was startled and ran off, before the priest could even make it out the village he was panting and out of breath, so all through the week he did cardio excercises. After church the following Sunday, the homeless man came again and asked for another half lemon, and the priest again provided him with half a lemon and again asked him why he needed it.

Again the homeless was startled and ran off, but the priest kept up. Not long after running the homeless man jumped into a river and swam across it, since the priest could not swim he begrudgingly went home. All through the week he had been taught how to swim, going through the motions and visiting the local pool. Sunday after church the homeless man again came asking for the half lemon and the priest again asked why he need it and the homeless man again was startled and ran off, but the priest managed to keep up and swim the river but the homeless man climbed a tree.

The priest was angry and upset, but went home and was taught how to climb trees. On Sunday after church the homeless man *again* asked for a half lemon and the priest *again* provided it, and he also asked him why he need it again, but the man was startled and ran off, but the priest was able to keep, swim the river, and climb the tree, but at the top the homeless man swung on a branch across a ravine. The priest was furious, kicking the tree once he got down, screaming in the sky and howling with anger.

But eventually he went home and was taught how to swing on ropes and not go off target, and was ready for the man on Sunday. After church the priest had a lemon ready and gave it to the man before he even asked, and he again asked him why he needed half a lemon but he still ran, the priest kept up with him, swam the river and climbed the tree, and swung across the ravine, but the homeless locked himself behind a door before the priest could grab him. By this point the priest fell to his knees and began sobbing, but eventually went home.

Throughout the week the priest was taught how to break down doors by the local firemen, and how to break or pick locks by the local locksmith. On Sunday the man walked up to the priest and stopped, the priest was holding the lemon in his hand, and as the man reached for the lemon without either of them exchanging words the priest grabbed him by the wrist and said ""Child, please, I *beg* of you, what do you need this half lemon for?!"" but alas, the homeless man broke the grip and ran.

This time however, the priest kept up, swam the river and climbed the tree, swung across the ravine, and after hours of work he finally broke the door the man hid behind. With a crazed look the priest slowly walked to the man and said ""Child, you can not run forever, and you are cornered, please just tell me why you wanted the half lemon"" the priest had tears forming in his eyes, and the homeless man had shear terror in his.

""D-do you *promise* not to tell *anyone* why I need half a lemon?"" the priest gave a solemn nod and the homeless man said ""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes.

There's a man walking along the beach enjoying the beautiful sunset when he comes across a girl crying. He asks her, ""What's wrong?"" She tells him, ""I'm 21 y.o., I have no arms, no legs and I've never been kissed."" So he looks around, bends down and gives her the most passionate kiss. He stands up, ""There, now you've been kissed,"" and he walks away. As he was walking away he hears her crying again, so he turns around. He asks, ""Now what's wrong?"" She says, ""I'm 21 y.o., I have no arms, no legs and I've never been fucked."" So he looks around, gently picks her up and tosses her into the water, ""There, now you're fucked!""

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a ""Honk if you love Jesus"" bumper sticker. 

I was feeling particularly sassy that day, because I had just come from a thrilling choir practice followed by a powerful prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.

I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed.

It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus; because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed.
I found that LOTS of people love Jesus.  Why, while I was sitting there, the nice man behind started honking like crazy, and he leaned out of his window and screamed, ""for the love of God, GO! GO!""   What an exuberant cheerleader he was for the Lord.. 

Everyone started honking!  I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. 

I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love.  There must have been a man from Florida back there, because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach. 

I saw another man waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.  When I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was an Hawaiian good luck sign or something.

Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. 

My grandson burst out laughing; why even he was enjoying this religious experience.

A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed.

So I waved to all my sisters and brothers, smiled at them all, and drove on through the intersection.

I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again, and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window, and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away.

The farmer answers the door and while waiting for a tow truck, the farmer tells him he’s got three beautiful daughters who are itching to get married. The salesman tells him he’d be delighted to meet them. He says it’s always been his dream to marry an impossibility beautiful girl and have the world’s most beautiful baby.

 That night, he takes out Linda, the blonde. They come home hours later and the farmer hears them out laughing on the porch as they enter.

 “So? What did you think? Asks the farmer when he’s alone with the salesman.

 “She really is beautiful! And funny! We laughed all night! But... well, to be honest- and not that you can easily tell by looking at her, but she’s just a liiiiitle bit bow-legged.”

 “I see,” says the farmer. “I know you’re picky. Try Lucy tomorrow, huh?”

 “Sure!”

 The next night he takes out the farmer’s stunning redheads. They’re gone for hours. Finally they come home and the farmer says- “Well? Is she the one for you?”

 “Lucy’s great! And so smart! But, um... and not that you could easily tell just by looking at her, but she’s just a liiiiiitle bit cross-eyed.”

 The farmer reminds him he’s got one beautiful daughter left.

 “OK! Tomorrow!”

 The next night he takes out Lorna, the spectacular brunette. They’re only gone one hour and the salesman runs in to see the farmer all excited!

 “She’s perfect! I can’t believe it! I want to marry her right away!”

 “Congratulations, son!”

 Nine months later, Lorna gives birth to a baby boy. The salesman can’t wait! He rushes to the viewing window, only to see his new son has big buck teeth, patches of hair sticking out at weird angles and a lazy eye. The salesman is in shock!

 The farmer joins him at the window:

 “Well now... that sure is a sight, huh?”

 “I... I don’t understand! Our baby should have been gorgeous!”

 The farmer looks him in the eye and says- “You know, the thing about my Lorna is- and not that you could easily tell by looking at her, but when you met her, she was just a liiiiitle bit pregnant.”","A traveling salesman’s car breaks down, so he walks to a nearby farmhouse...",2

He would go on hunger strikes, so he was a pretty skinny guy to begin with. But one time, he walked all the way from the interior of India to the coast to pick up salt from the seaside. He was protesting something to do with British taxes, I can't remember the details, but he did the whole trip barefoot, and by the end of the trip his callouses on his feet were so thick he could practically walk on hot coals.

He hardly ate or slept on his March to the sea, he power walked the whole thing. The thing about doing strenuous exercise without much food is, your body starts breaking down other fuel, like muscles and connective tissues, and your breath gets this sickly sweet smell to it, like rotting fruit.

When I have a migraine, I go home, get in a nice hot bathtub, and soak for a while. Then I have my wife sponge me off with the hottest water I can stand, especially around the forehead. This helps a little. Then I get out of the tub, take her into the bedroom, and even if my head is killing me, I force myself to have sex with her. 

Almost always, the headache is immediately gone. Now, give it a try, and come back and see me in six weeks.""

When they paint, they are often instructed to paint their mood, or something they would like to see or do when they are released. Some paint melancholy things, dark with depressive imagery and muted colors. Others paint idealized scenarios of getting back together with old flames, doing normal things with their families, that sort of stuff.

In exercise, they can use stationary bikes or treadmills, medicine balls, yoga, all the usual things you'd expect - sans metal weights and resistance bands.

The library is lacking, mostly due to little by way of literature being approved as ""safe"" for the patients to read. Mostly lighthearted stories, YA, educational texts, stuff that would only offend your sensibilities by being a horrible bore.

Cooking is interesting, sort of. They serve the same thing for dinner every single evening:  a casserole. It's rather underwhelming in flavor, but each night a different patient is allowed to make the cheese &amp; herb crumble for it. 

What's interesting about that is that, without fail, *every* patient puts the crumble on the very bottom of the casserole, never on top. None seem to have reasoning for it, nor do any of the staff know when it became the norm around there. By the time the food is done cooking, the would-be topping has lost all crispness to it, but, hey ...

St Peter asks the 1 st question of the cowboy: how many days of the week start with he letter “t”.  
The old fellow thinks a bit and answers with a drawl, “well, I figure all of them do”. 
St. Peter chuckles and says “there are only 2, Tuesday and Thursday but not the rest. But I’m curious about your answer”. 
The cowboy looks at St Peter and says “ well y’all right bout there being 2 but they is T’day and T’morra”.  St. Peter is delighted by the answer and decides to ask the next question. 

“How many seconds are there in a year?”  
The cowboy ponders for a moment and answers “12”. St Peter chuckles again and says “Not even close, how did you figure that.”  
The old fella says “well there’s January 2nd, February 2nd .... and December 2nd”. St. Peter is amused by the answer and the cowboys oblique approach to the questions so he decided to more to the final question. 

“What is Jesus’s first name?”
The cowboy answers immediately, “Andrew”
St Peter, now beyond doubting the cowboy’s logic, asks, “Ok, how do you know that?”
The cowboy replies, “I learned it at church from that song”
“Which song?” St. Peter asks, clearly confused.

The first artist he finds is a well-known minimalist in town. he's honored to take on some new work and agrees. The second artist is... eh, okay. He just graduated art school and is getting started. He's excited at the prospect to build his portfolio and create some cool, new works. The third guy is pretty well-known around town. His art is okay. he's done a few minor sculptures etc. He agrees begrudgingly to do some paintings for the exhibit. 

Each artist has 6 months to pull together 8-15 pieces that really embody the idea of minimalism for this guy. The first guy gets to work right away and paints 10 paintings that are all simple lines and shapes. he's ridiculously excited to share his work. 

The second guy thinks he'll do some sculptures. He harvests clay from around the river and makes some very interesting pieces that show off lines and form. He's pretty excited at the end of the 6 months to show off his work.

The third guy, though. He's spent the entire 6 months pretty much stewing about the art gallery's ""vision"". He recently took some classes on classical painting and thinks this gallery will benefit from some ""real"" art. Taking inspiration from churches all over the world, he's created 8 large, gold-framed portraits of angels, devils, St. Peter the whole works. he's poured his whole soul into these works and really, anyone that saw them would admit they are gorgeous.  

So, the three artists and the gallery owner meet up the day before the gallery opens to show their work. The gallery owner loves the first guy's work. ""I have just the place for these,"" he says and gives them a place of honor as you walk into the gallery. 

The second artist sheepishly removes the covering from his sculptures, thinking they're no match for the first guy's work, but the gallery owner is just blown away. ""wow, I have just the place for these,"" he says. He puts them in a courtyard with natural light so they can be appreciated. 

The third guy is still hung over from his bender. He grumpily removes the coverings on his paintings. All huge, gold and just, busy paintings. The owner is in shock. This isn't what he asked for at all. Were those cherubs? Angels? Devils? Is that a monk? He stammers for a moment, ""Uh... I'm sorry... uh.. this.."" He steels his backbone. ""This isn't what I asked for at all. I can't put this in my gallery. I'm sorry. I'll still pay you, but this is better suited for the museum way in the other town or something."" 

The third artist is furious! He put months of work into these paintings. He storms off with a ""Fine! Throw them away for all I care!"" 

The gallery owner and the other two artists are befuddled. What can we do with these huge ornate paintings that are far too gaudy to hang in a modern art museum? The gallery owner finally says ""what if we used the canvases and just sort of fixed them. We can paint over them. Then your work won't look like they're in a barren warehouse."" 

The first artist looks at the paintings and says ""I'm sorry. I cannot paint over another artist's work. Let's just donate them and push the opening off until next week. We can make new paintings."" 

The second artist says ""Well. I can give it a try."" The first artist looks incredulously at him. ""You would paint over someone's blood, sweat, and tears to make a name for yourself?!"" and leaves. 

The gallery owner is relieved. He leaves the second artist to fix the paintings. 

Well, that artist stayed up all night, in a flurry of paints and thinners, he's managed to fix most of the paintings so they'll match the theme. As he's working, after far too much coffee and no sleep whatsoever, he looks over at the first artist's work and thinks ""What if I 'fixed' that one too. It sure would like great for me if I had more paintings in the gallery. people would be really impressed with me!"" His sleep-deprived brain thinks this is a good idea. 

As his brush is ready to touch the canvas of the first artist, the gallery owner comes bursting in, yelling ""No, no no! If it ain't baroque, don't fix it!"" ","This guy wants to open a new, modern art gallery in town. . .",11

The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students Whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name ............. 
As usual and as expected no one answered.

The Professor peacefully kept the Pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class. Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, ""I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride.

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.
(Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy night.)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't.

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me.

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor turned to that boy and said,

""Young Man I didn't get My Ph. D in Psychology by sitting on my Ass.""","One day in a well known University, a Sr Psychology Professor",3

The crowd murmured in unanimous approval. Steve stood up on the bar, dropped his trousers, and placed his privates in the crocodile's open mouth. The croc closed his mouth as the crowd gasped. After a minute, Irwin grabbed a beer bottle and smacked the croc hard on the top of its head.

The croc opened his mouth and he removed his genitals unscathed as promised.

The crowd cheered and the first of his free drinks were delivered. Steve stood up again and made another offer. ""I'll pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try.""

A hush fell over the crowd. After a while, a hand went up in the back of the bar.

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, and St. Peter had to tell the first one, “Heaven’s getting pretty close to full today, and I’ve been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what’s your story?”

The first man replies: “Well, for a while I’ve suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn’t reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn’t you know it, he wouldn’t fall off.

So I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and started hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn’t stand that for long, so he let go and fell—but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.”

“That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,” said St. Peter, and he let the man in.

The second man comes up and St. Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. “It’s been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn’t hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved! But then he started beating on me and kicking me. I managed to hold on until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but okay. Just when I was thinking I was going to be all right, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me, killing me instantly. And, now I’m here.”

Once again, St. Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. St. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

“OK, picture this,” says the third man, “I’m hiding naked inside a refrigerator....”",St. Peter's Gate,7

Ajit turns down another aisle and sees the guy at the deli counter scoping him out like a lion would look at a wounded wildebeest. Certain there is something amiss, Ajit decides to pay up and leave.

Ajit gets to the check stand and places his groceries on the conveyer belt. The checker makes meaningful eye contact with Ajit, and says “With teeth that size, you must have a real roomy mouth.” The checker unzips his pants and is on Ajit before he can resist. 

Ajit is struggling, when the produce guy and the deli counter guy descend upon him as well. Each teams up to begin mercilessly gang raping Ajit, whose cries are muffled only by the checker’s penis and his enormous teeth. 

Suddenly, Ajit sees a police officer. “Help!” cries Ajit, between the relentless thrusts of the checker’s hips to his mouth. “Police —mmph— mmph— help!”

The police officer takes stock of the situation. He shrugs and says “I wouldn’t want the government to impose on this situation. I trust the market to sort this out.”",Ajit Pai is shopping in a grocery store...,84

The cashier hesitates a moment, and then tells the customer that he doesn’t know. It’s his first day on the job, see, and the manager must’ve forgot to tell him. So the customer browses a bit, decides not to get
anything, and walks out.

The manager comes out as the guys leaving, and tells the cashier: “I overhead a bit of your conversation there, and that the customer seemed pretty interested in the loosies. Why didn’t you sell him one?” So the cashier tells him, and the manager reminds the cashier: “you’re supposed to tell him ‘for you, good sir, only twenty-nine cents.’”

So the manager steps into the office and soon enough, another customer walks in. Knowing his manager might be able to hear him, the cashier wants to make a good impression. So he starts right out with, “good sir! Would you like to try one of our loose camels? They’re only twenty-nine cents! For you, anyway, good sir.” 

The customer looks skeptically at the cashier, and asks, “well, are they fresh?”

The cashier freezes up. Eventually, he replies, “well, I don’t actually know, see, it’s my first day and my manager must have forgotten to tell me.” 

So this customer, too, leaves empty handed. Soon after, the manager comes out: “what happened that time? You chased him off! Don’t jump the gun. Relax. And if anyone else asks if they’re fresh, you say “you bet your ass.” 

Once again the manager leaves, and for a while it stays quiet. Then a pretty young thing walks in. He can’t believe she’s old enough to smoke. “Hey,” she says. “hello,” He replies. “Would you like to try one of our loose camels? They’re only twenty-nine cents.” 

“Hmmm....” she puts a finger to her lips, “i think I’m feeling loose enough already.” She tips him a wink. “How fresh are those pipes?” 

“Oh! Um, they’re, um, you bet your ass they’re fresh.” He grins.

“Mmm. Good. Now really sell me on it, baby. Tell me....” she lowers her voice to a whisper “...should I really... suck one down? What do you think?”

The cashier considers for a moment, and replies, “well... it would certainly make my day, I haven’t made a sale yet. And assuming you don’t care about the carcinogens or the increased potential for yellow teeth, I’ll just need to see your id and... hey! Where are you going?” The girl walked out.

It’s quiet for a bit until the manager returns, and he asks if the cashier had any business. He tells the manager that one girl came in but didn’t end up getting anything. As he tries to explain the story, the manager tells him, “if anyone comes in here and asks if they should smoke something from my store, tell them, ‘you’d better, or somebody else will!’ Oh. And quit fantasizing on company time!”

By this point the cashier is determined to make a sale, whatever it takes. He goes over the manager’s lines again and again in preparation for the next customer.

After a long  while, a customer enters wearing a ski mask. He pulls out a handgun and points it at the cashier. The cashier tenses up. “Hey! Stay loose!” Cries the robber. “How much you got in the cash register?” 

Cashier: “Uh... loose. Right. Twenty-nine cents.” 

Robber *cocks gun*: “are you really being fresh with me right now?” 

Cashier: “you bet your ass!”

Robber: “man, do you /want/ me to smoke you?” 

Cashier: “you’d better, or somebody else will!”

She gives the mortician a blank check and says, ""I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing."" The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly. She says to the mortician, ""Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?"" To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, ""There's no charge."" ""No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,"" she says. ""Honestly, ma'am,"" the mortician says, ""it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice. So I just switched the heads.""",A man who had just died is delivered to a local mortuary....,2617

This isn't the first day of school; the teacher knows this kid by now. He's very nice and respectful, so the teacher lets him go.

The kid takes the pass, goes out for 3 minutes, and comes back later. He puts the pass on the wall, and takes his seat. 

In his next period, he raises his hand again. Again, the teacher knows him well, and lets him go. He's gone for 6 minutes, and when he comes back, some students snicker at his absence. He puts the pass on the wall and returns to his seat.

In his last period, he has to use the bathroom again, and so he raises his hand and asks the question. The teacher says yes, and the students is gone for 12 minutes. He comes back, the class laughing at him. Embarrassed, he takes his seat.

When he goes to school the next day, he is instantly called to the office.

The 3 teachers, the principal, and his parents are there. A short discussion starts regarding the importance of valuable class time, and as it ends, he raises his hand.

""Can I go to the bathroom real quick?""

The principal, shocked, slams his hand down onto the table and exclaims, ""Are you kidding me?""

""No.""

""Well, you're not going.""

The student immediately pisses himself. The entire panel is shocked, and the parents take him home to change.

The parent asks the kid, ""Why did you do that? Did you actually have to go?""

The student replies, ""Yes, I did mom.""

The dad then looks at him and says, ""In that case, it's safe to say that urine-sane.""","A teacher is giving a lecture in a classroom, when suddenly, a kid in the back raises his hand.",0

It’s particularly busy in heaven, and God decides that he is only going to let the most upsetting and ridiculous deaths into heaven.

The day goes on and around midday three men arrive at St. Peter’s gates, and god stops them, he says...

“Sorry guys, I can’t let you through unless your story is worthy enough.” 

So the first guy walks up to God, looks around and starts his tale...

“I’m a middle class man married to a beautiful wife, I live on the 11th floor of the Richards apartment complex, a relatively low quality apartment and I work a 12 hour day, 11-11. Well today I got off work early, Say around 8ish, and I opened the door to my apartment. Here I saw on the welcome mat a pair of men’s shoes, not mine, and keys to car neither me nor my wife owned, so immediately I was alarmed. I looked around the house in a hurried rush and found nothing, until I went out on to the balcony where I saw a man hanging by his finder tips, in a fit of rage I took a hammer and smashed his fingers. However when he fell, he fell into the bushes below with minor damage, so I threw the refrigerator on him crushing him instantly.”

God surprised by this asked

“How did you come to die then”

The man responded my claiming it was by heart attack from the event.

God let’s him through, and proceeds to look at the second man.

The man starts and says...

“I am a gymnast and I live on the 13th floor of the Richards apartments, I was practicing handstands on the balcony  when I slipped and fell over. Luckily I caught the railing a few floors below, slipping I thought it was over. Then a man came rushing out and I thought I was saved, but then he starts smashing my hands with a hammer, I fall and to my avail land in some bushes. I thought I made it out alive but then he throws a refrigerator on me, and that’s how I ended up here.”

God let’s the man through then turns to the third man.

The third man goes...

“Picture this, I’m naked inside a refrigerator...”",God is having a tough day,8
