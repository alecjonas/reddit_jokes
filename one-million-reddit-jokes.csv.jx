post,8b02q7,2qh72,jokes,false,1523293685,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8b02q7/the_missing_black_sheep/,self.jokes,,"Once there was this sheppard that had hundreds and hundreds of sheep, but out of all of them he liked a black one the most. It was the light of his life, always bragging about it's beauty to everybody and always admiringly looking after it in his flock.

On a sunny day, as he was resting his chin on his staff he started counting the sheep. 1,2,3.. and so on until he counted them all. With shock he realised his crown jewel, the black sheep was missing. He proceeded to look left and right for it and realised it must have gone over the ridge of the nearby hill, so he went searching for her.

Immediately after he went over the ridge he spotted a man digging a trench close by. He thought the man might have seen his sheep so he went to ask him:

""Excuse me sir, did you by any chance saw a black sheep pass by?""

The man stopped digging, looked at the sheppard and with a mildly agravated tone replied:

""Mate, I'm just digging from here to there, what's left I'm gonna finish tomorrow."" The man returned to digging his trench.

The sheppard, confused, thought he didn't make himself clear and tried to make himself better understood:

""Sir, I believe there has been a misunderstanding. I am looking for my sheep, a black sheep. It is the pride of my flock and the joy of my life. Did you happen by any chance to see it pass by?""

The man again stopped digging, threw his shovel to the ground, and visibly pissed off by the sheppard told him again:

""Mate, I'm just digging from here to there, what's left I'm gonna finish tomorrow."" And returned to digging his trench.

It was at this point a police man on a horse ridding along the ridge spotted the arguing men in the vicinity and galloped towards them. As soon as he reached them he got off his horse and asked the pair what was this all about, so the sheppard told him his version of the story:

""Hello sir, I am a sheppard around this parts, and I have lost one of my sheep, a black sheep. It was the jewel of my crown, pride of my flock and the joy and light of my life. I looked for her beyond the ridge, and saw this man digging this trench and wanted to ask him if he saw anything, but as soon as I told him about what happened he just replied with: &lt;Mate, I'm just digging from here to there, what's left I'm gonna finish tomorrow.&gt;, and turned around and started digging again""

It was at this point that the policeman's expression dramatically changed. He approached the two fellas a little more, told the man digging the trench to stop digging and pay attention, and as soon as he put his hand over the sheppard's shoulder said:

""Boy, do I know what this is about: you motherfuckers are trying to steal my horse!""",The missing black sheep,0

Since the audience was different each week, the magician did the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

""Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?""

Unfortunately a pack of velociraptors approach and start digging their way to him. When they are almost about to get to him a T-Rex shows up and attacks them. 

Sitting in the middle of poo Jeff looks on in awe as the pack and the T-Rex battle it out. After a prolonged fight the pack retreats. Just then he realizes that these velociraptors were trained and sent by Chris Pratt to save him. 

Jeff tries in vain to escape and the T-Rex pickups him up, shreds him to pieces and gobbles him up.


So what did we learn?

1) If you do something stupid against all advice you will end up in some serious shit.

2) While not everyone who takes you out of shit is a hero don't sit  and waste a chance like an idiot

3) Landing in shit is not the worst thing so if you're in deep shit then keep your mouth shut

1. Take a shower.
2. Splash on some nice smelling perfume.
3. Slip into a very sexy teddy.
4. Crawl into bed and position the frog in place.

firewood to be prepared.

an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National

be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told
them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,
""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The

Many years ago a man was traveling through the mountains of Switzerland. Nightfall was rapidly approaching and he had nowhere to sleep. He went up to a farmhouse and asked the farmer if he could spend the night.

The farmer told him he could sleep in the barn As the story goes, the farmer's daughter asked her father, 'Who is that man going into the barn?'

'That fellow traveling through needs a place to stay for the night, so I told him he could sleep in the barn,' said the farmer.

The daughter said, 'Perhaps he is hungry.' So she prepared a plate of food for him and took it out to the barn. About an hour later, the daughter returned. Her clothing was disheveled and there was straw in her hair. Straight up to bed she went.

The farmer's wife was very observant. She then suggested perhaps the man was thirsty. She fetched a bottle of wine and took it out to the barn! And she did not return for an hour. Her clothing was askew, her blouse buttoned incorrectly. She also headed straight to bed.

The next morning at sunrise the man in the barn got up and continued on his journey, waving to the farmer as he left.

When the daughter awoke and learned the visitor was gone, she broke into tears. 'How could he leave without even saying goodbye,' she cried. 'We made such passionate love last night!'

'What?' shouted the father, as he angrily ran out of the house looking for the man, who by now was halfway up the mountain.

The farmer screamed up at him, 'I'm going to get you! You had sex with my daughter!'

The man looked back down from the mountainside, cupped his hand next to his mouth, and yelled out.....

There is also a wall full of candy, with weird names such as ""Hoot Gummies"" and ""Woof Bars"".

""Excuse me, sir, is there anything I can help you find?"" says one of the store clerks from behind him.

""Oh, uh, yeah,"" the kid says, startled. He looks around him quickly and picks up one of the newer-looking tricks. ""What does this do?"" he asks.

The store clerk replies, ""Oh, that?"" She picks it up and spins it around her finger - or attempted to. ""It's a Fidget Spinner Joke. You can try as hard as you want, but it will never spin.""

He laughs. ""That sounds hilarious! What does this one do?""

""That's our Padlock Joke - it will never open with any key ever, even the one that's provided with it.""

""Cool! Can you tell me about these?"" And so it went on and on as he asked the poor shopkeeper about what seemed like every new item in the store, until he comes back to the wall of sweets.

""What about these Chirp Chocolates?"" he asks.

""That's hilarious!"" laughs the boy. ""Do these Hoot Gummies make you hoot like an owl?"" She nods. ""And these Squeaking Marshmallows? And- hey, what's this?"" He reaches into the large container of wrapped mints and pulled out a brightly-colored fishing reel that had a very tiny handle.

The clerk takes it from him and frowns.  Before she can speak, he's already grabbed up yet another odd-looking item.  This one is sticky all over, with a tacky, glue-like feel. It's a small replica of a kiln, but with a tiny scythe attached.  When a lever is pressed, the scythe slices through the air in front of the little kiln.  However, just as he does that, the little kiln makes a ""CAW"" noise and some yellow, ammonia-smelling stuff trickles onto his hand.  He drops it with a yelp of disgust.

So, what she did is this: she took a Polaroid picture of her giving her new boyfriend a blowjob and sent it to her old boyfriend with a note reading, ""I found a new boyfriend, leave me alone.""

The gorilla quickly grabbed the lion by the rear and started pounding him in the ass.

When he finished he yanked the lion from the quicksand, tossed him as far as he could, and ran for his life.

The lion was furious and gave chase. The gorilla had to die before anybody could find out what happened.

After time the gorilla could run no more and the lion was gaining on him. He quickly sat down on a log, crossed his legs, and opened a newspaper to cover his face.

A split second later, there was the lion.

""Excuse me, sir, did you happen to see a gorilla run by?""

The gorilla couldn't help himself.

""Oh, you mean the one that ass fucked the king of the jungle?""

Particularly, Bill had marital troubles, and was explaining his worries that his wife was cheating on him. 
 One of the guys there that night was named Arty.  Now, Arty's family had always been involved with the Mafia, and it wasn't talked about but it was very well understood among the fraternity brothers that Arty had joined the family business as an enforcer.  Arty and Bill had been good friends for years, and upon hearing Bill's woes decided to help him out.  He offered to check and see if Bill's wife was cheating on him.  Bill, desperate for an answer, took Arty up on the offer.  Days later, Arty comes to Bill at his house and explains to him that he followed Bill's wife for a few days and she had made an unusual number of trips to the local grocery store after hours, leaving with nothing but what she walked in with.  Arty followed her into the grocery store one night and witnessed her having an affair with the manager.  Bill was absolutely furious, and began devising how to get back at his wife. It was at that point that Arty offered to 'take care of the situation' and to make sure that Bill's wife 'took her last trip to the grocery store, if you know what I mean'.  Bill was aghast at first, but as he searched inside himself he discovered that he was willing to go through with it, and agreed that Arty should kill his wife.  Bill asked him how much Arty usually makes on this kind of a job and offered to pay him full price, but Arty waved him off and said that friends don't pay.  Bill insisted though, so Arty told him he'd do it for a single dollar and that would be his payment.  Bill relented eventually, and handed over the dollar.  The next day, Arty followed Bill's wife to the grocery store, and hid behind her car as she went inside.  After some time had passed, and she came back to her car to head home, Arty jumped out and strangled her.  However, he looked up and saw the grocery store manager who had followed the woman with her purse, so he also had to strangle him.  Unluckily for Arty, the whole thing was caught on the security footage at the grocery store.  The headline ran in the news the next morning:  Arty Chokes Two for a Dollar at the Grocery Store!",Great Deal at the Grocery Store,10

Noting down in his book he ask the second penguin in line. And the second penguin replies the same answer. ""I eat, I sleep and I hit ice"" 

Slowly he had surveyed 99 penguins and he asked the last penguin in line the same question: "" Hey penguin what do you do everyday?""

And the last penguin replied: ""I eat and I sleep"" 

Seeing that he did not had 'hitting ice' in this penguin's list, the explorer felt curious and asked the last penguin why he don't hit ice. 

The last penguin gave out a sigh and replied slight irritatedly: ""Well because I am ice""

Jesus went next and his ball ended up in the water also but he calmly walked on the water to the ball and also knocked his ball up on the green.

The old man strolled up to the tee and took his shot and the ball was headed right toward the same water hazard. Right before the ball hit the water a fish jumped out of the water caught the ball in it's mouth just as an eagle swooped down and caught the fish. The eagle flew over the green and dropped the fish next to the hole then the ball popped out of the fish's mouth and went right into the hole.

Jesus and Moses were noticeably irritated and Jesus turned to the old man and said seriously,

Dear Vincent, I am feeling pretty badly because it looks like I won't be able to plant my Yellow Yam and Sweet Potato Garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me....Love, Dad

Dear Dad, Don't dig up that garden. That's where I buried the bodies.

In addition to being the drummer for Jesus Rocks, Sister Mary Margaret carried on duties as the music instructor at the local Catholic high school.  Unfortunately she passed away at an early age.  And also unfortunately, this led to a dispute over Sister Mary Margaret's drum set.  When a nun passes away, their belonging are distributed to their fellow Sisters in Jesus.  Sister Josephine made a claim on the drum set citing her close relationship to the departed and the sentimental value.  However, Sister Theresa also laid a claim on the drum set because she was taking over the music class and she wanted to use it for that purpose.  

The two couldn't work it out, so they took it to the Mother Superior.  Mother Superior hear out both sides to the argument and ultimately declared ""This is a conundrum"".

In a quiet voice he said: “If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a “friendly fire” missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”
 
“Fantastic!” exclaimed Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?”

The Russia has never lost a match because he has a move called "" The pretzel "" every opponent trapped in the pretzel loses the match. So the wrestler and his coach devise an entire strategy devoted to avoid being caught in the pretzel.

The Olympics come and sure enough the american is facing the russia in the final match. The coach pulls his guy aside and says "" Remember all we trained for. Do not let him get you in that damn pretzel. "" 

The match starts and within the first 5 seconds the russian grabs the american and scoops him up into the pretzel. Completely dejected the coach closes his eyes as the inevitable is at hand. All of a sudden theres a loud scream and a roar from the crowd! The coach opens his eyes and sees the russian flying up in the air and the american grabs him and slams him to the mat pinning him.

Excited beyond belief and totally dumbfounded the coach rushes his wrestler begging him to tell him how he got out of the move. The wrestler tells his coach after the celebrations he will explain. 

When the two can finally get a moment to speak the coach says  ""Ok I gotta know! How did you escape???""  the wrestler replies, "" Well you see he got me in that damn pretzel and I thought I was done for. Right when I was about to give up I opened my eyes and saw a pair of balls right in front of my face! So I stretched my neck out and bit those babies as hard as I could ."" 

The coach amazed says "" Wow! So you bit his balls and he let you go huh? "" the wrestler replies ""Well no not exactly. But you'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls.""",An American wrestler prepares to face the Russian in the Olympics....,9

""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 
""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 



""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. 


Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. 
She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.



 He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""

As they entered the shop they were greeted by the Miss Catarina.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Welcome, my beautiful friends! I would like for you to join me on a wonderful adventure into your minds.*

The two women were excited for the experience while the skeptical one rolled her eyes. Miss Catarina acknowledge the gesture.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I see we have a disbeliever in the room. In what way would I be able to lessen your uncertainty?*

Skeptical Woman: How about you start by guessing our names.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And that is exactly what I will do! However, uncovering the names of you three would be way too simple for Miss Catarina. One may say I overheard you addressing each other during a recent debate about coming in here.* (She says with a smirk)

The faces of the other two women were filled with amazement.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I will predict the names of your children and explain some history behind why it was chosen!*

Thinking that there could be no way that she would know, the skeptical woman agreed. Miss Catarina starts with the first two.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Princess, your name has to be Penelope!*

The first woman was stun while Penelope looked to her mom confused.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I see you are confused my child, but be no more. You would most likely recognize your name as Penny! It is short for Penelope! Do you know why your name is Penny? It’s because your mommy loves collecting money! All kinds of money! Old money, new money and even foreign money!*

The first two women cheered while confirming that it is correct. The third woman was a bit shocked but still skeptical. 

* **Miss Catarina**: *It was nice meeting you, Penelope!*

She then moves to the second child.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Angel. You must be Lillian!*

* **Lillian**: *Yes! But everyone calls me Lilly!*

* **Miss Catarina**: *And I bet that is because your mommy loves flowers! All types of flowers! Wild flowers, house flowers and even exotic flower!*

The two women confirmed with excitement! But now the skeptical woman is concern.

* **Miss Catarina**: *It’s a pleasure meeting you, Lillian.*

Saving the best for last, she walks over to the third child.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And you my handsome Prince. Your name is the most fitting of all!* 

While feeling embarrassed, the skeptical woman cuts off Miss Catarina.

* **Skeptical Woman**: *I’ve had enough! My son and I do not want to hear what you have to say! We’re leaving!*

While looking at the sad little boy getting taken out the shop, Miss Catarina shouts to him.

* **Miss Catarina**: *You have a wonderful day, Richard!*

Dave downs his third beer, wipes his mouth, and starts to slur as he says, ""I haven't been laid in months, I lost my job, and I'm behind on my rent. Life has been pretty shitty for me lately, and I might get evicted if I don't manage to get another $3000 soon.""  
The bartender feels pretty bad for him, so he says, ""Here's what. I have some things I need done, and if you can do them for me, I can pay you $3000.""  
""Sssurre, what are they?"" Dave asks, his slurring even more noticeable.  
""First, my mom hasn't had a man in the longest time. Her birthday is coming up, so I was going to hire her an escort, but they can be pretty expensive. Instead, you're going to give her the ride of life. Secondly, I've got a really mean dog with a bad tooth. I tried taking him to the dentists, but they refused to pull his tooth out because he kept trying to bite their hands off. I need you to remove his bad tooth,"" the bartender says.  
 Dave drunkenly says, ""G--got it. Where are they?""  
""They're in the backroom there"" *the bartender points* ""But are you okay to do it now? You don't look like you're in the best condition.""  
""Don't worry. Woman. Dog. Sex. Teeth. Got it"" he says as he gives a thumbs up and then drunkenly sways into the backroom.  
The bartender is a little concerned, as the dog is quite vicious, so he presses his ear against the door. A woman is heard yelling, moaning, and screaming, followed by some light sobbing. Then, a door is heard opening and a loud bark from a dog, followed by a growl. Some shuffling can be heard, followed by some grunting and whimpering. Then, footsteps are heard approaching the door, so the bartender backs away as the door opens.  
Dave stumbles out, zipping up his pants. ""By the way, I couldn't find your mom's bad tooth.""","Dave walks into a bar,",10

“A whiskey, neat, keep it coming” orders the muscular man.
One drinks after another, the bartender finally gathers the courage to ask. 
""Why did you carry that tiny ragged doll around? 
No offence sir, but one would normally assume it’s not yours, 
since it’s a little unfitting with your- um, physique?”
“It’s ok, I get that question a lot” answers the muscular man.
It’s a doll of my daughter who was passing away in the house fire last year, along with my wife
and this doll is the only thing that’s left of her- no, actually, the only thing is left from the house.
I’ve been carrying it around ever since as a memorial to both of my daughter and my wife”
Tearing up by the muscular man heartbreaking story, the bartender offers his condolences.
They chat for a while until the muscular man excuses himself to the restroom and entrusts 
his doll with the bartender. The bartender fears that anyone else will mistaking it for a trash, 
he brings it to the back room.

The muscular man, now finishes with his business, comes back and notices that the doll is gone-
he’s starting to panic and demands an explanation from the bartender.
The bartender say it’s fine, he just moves it to the back room.
The bartender goes into the back room but couldn’t find the doll anywhere 
so he goes into the the bar owner office on the second floor to ask if he knows anything.
The bar owner says he noticed the ragged doll on the shelf and has mistaken
It for a trash so he threw it away to the garbage truck that coincidentally operating nearby 
and he’s afraid the truck has already leave.
The bartender explains everything to the bar owner.
Now feeling guilty, the bar owner goes out to explain and apologise to the muscular man
but after hearing the story, the muscular man broke down completely
and is super angry.

He goes into the back room, grabs a sledgehammer 
and starts pounding everything he sees, the counter, the chairs, 
and eventually everything in the bar is destroyed.
The bar owner is now shrieking in fear but still trying to reason with him.
Figured the muscular man would not stop the ruckus anyway, 
he utters- I throw away your prized possession and you have destroyed my precious bar for it 
and that’s fair but can’t you at least leave the building alone? 
You already destroy too much in my bar but the building is rental and not mine 
and if you damage it, I won’t have enough to pay the fines. 
I don’t deserve all of this just for a little accident.

Filed with rage, the muscular man doesn’t seem to hear anything anymore. 
He continues pounding the concrete floor until every square metre break.
He then moves on to the wall and starts pounding it.
The first, second and third side of the wall is struck down one after another
and finally he moves to the fourth side of the wall and bring it down completely.
The muscular man then shaking his head, turns his face to the monitor and speaks to you
“This-- whole joke sucks, don’t you think?”.

So I looked under my desk and saw a something written in purple marker. So I raised my hand and said 'Teacher, I found something in purple marker written under my desk.'

His dad told him that he had 5 minutes to gather his belongings and get off his property.

Later that night, Johnny's walking along the road, his belongings in a hobo bag. About 2 hours after the sun went down, Johnny came across a drug dealer. The dealer said ""You look a little young to be walking around on the streets this late. What happened?"" But before Johnny could even say his first 'Well,' the cops show up. A few hours later, Johnny's sitting in court and the judge says to him ""Johnny, you have good grades, you're a good kid, so what are you doing in my court?"" So Johnny says to the judge ""Well I was sitting in math class when I got bored. So I looked under my desk and saw a something written in purple marker.

So the judge looks at Johnny and asks him ""What was written under that desk Johnny?"" Johnny said ""Purple Passion!"" The judge says that he was not allowed to enter the state for the next 15 years.

15 years later, Johnny go back to the state and back to his home town where he enters an old coffee shop. The waitress walks up to his table and asks him if he would like anything. Johnny tiredly replies ""Just a water please."" The waitress, noticing that something's off, sits down across from him and asks him what wrong. So Johnny said ""About 15 years ago, I was sitting in math class when I got bored. So I looked under my desk and saw a something written in purple marker.

The waitress then asked Johnny ""What was written under that desk?"" And Johnny asked ""You're not going to kick me out, are you?"" And the waitress said ""No."" ""You're not going to call the cops, are you?"" And she said ""No."" And then Johnny apprehensively said ""Purple...Passion..."" The waitress remained calm and took out her pen and paper and scribbled something down. She then slid it over to Johnny.
Later that night, Johnny was standing on the side of a road looking at an old barn. He then looked at the note the waitress had given him. It said 'At 11-o-clock, look up at the top room of the old barn from across the street and you will find what you're looking for. He looked at his watch and it had JUST turned 11.

This time, they decided to race through Europe, starting with London. The plan was to race to Dover, get the ferry across, and go along the French coast, across Belgium, Germany, and head north through Denmark. 

The hare figured that his fur would keep him warm, so he decided to keep going north through Scandinavia, assuming it'd get too cold for the tortoise who would give up. 

The tortoise had everything he needed stored in his shell, so he was prepared for the cold since the shell was his home. 

They eventually get to Sweden, and the hare is struggling. He doesn't want to risk falling asleep this time, so he decides to hitch hike in a lorry. The lorry is headed to the ferry port towards St Petersburg. 

The next day on the ferry, the Hare receives a text message from the tortoise saying he's won, and asking where the hare is. Confused as they still have the rest of Europe to cover, the hare asks for proof.  The tortoise replies back with a picture of himself at Harparanda with the caption: ""see? I'm at the Finnish line!""",The hare and the tortoise,4

There lived many primitive tribes who, despite their primitive primitiveness, had many advances in different subjects such as agriculture and architecture.

For centuries, this land experienced what we refer to today as peace. All the tribes from around the land knew each other very well, in fact, you could even ask a new born to count all the people they knew, and they'd still count every single person on the whole island, even other newborns.

One day however, as the sun was shining high in the sky and the wind dancing joyfully in the air, an almighty, yet foreign ship, stumbled upon the shores of the yet unexplored Utopia, as it was cruising across the blue waves of glittering water. Said ship had on board a crew of a few new members, numerous old-timers, and a captain, who was also a quite remarkably successful business-man.

As he descended from the ship, his black top-hat sitting proudly on his head, curling his long black mustache with one hand and holding his gold headed black cane with the other, he gazed off into the distance pondering about how he could profit from this new land, thinking about all the minerals hidden within the ground beneath his two void-black shoes, about all the new and exotic plants scattered about the land, and most importantly, about the fortune he could make by introducing the natives of the land to the wonders of technology.

While still thinking about how to start his investment filled journey, and while his crew were descending from their fine ride, he noticed, not too far away from where he was planted, a few kids, from the looks of it, aged between ten and twelve years old. They were wearing what looked to be shirts made from a reflective brown silk-like material and pants going all the way down to their ankles made from a more green version of the same tissue. Having no solid starting point, he decided to follow them, thinking they could lead him to civilization, and lead him they did.

The following years were spent exploiting others for profit. What once was a Utopian-like world quickly became a hate filled, war poisoned land full of nothing but problems and misery. This went on for a few decades, all the while, the business man was fattening his pockets.

One day, he man was sitting in his office, legs on his desk, with a pipe in his mouth, reading a newspaper depicting a conflict that broke out the day before. Skipping most of the lines, as he usually does, he finally stumbled upon the one depicting the reason: 

"" Yesterday a group of three kids were out playing on the border between their neck of the woods and their neighbors's, when suddenly, a big spillage of an unknown black substance rose from the ground beneath them, it is still unclear what this goopy substance is. ""

At the idea of what he saw as an opportunity, the already wealthy man had but one word in mind : Profit.

He then spent time and money exploiting the newly found black gold mine and made millions out of it. While this was happening, another part of the planet was busy dreaming up the idea of what we refer to today as "" car "". On one special day, this information reached our business-man friend, who at this point, I don't need to say what crossed his mind and what happened next.

He came up with the idea of a car which functioned with "" gas "", a material extracted from the black liquid now referred to as petrol, the same one discovered a while back, specifically in the third previous paragraph. He was worshiped all over the land for creating a way for the people to travel around faster and in a safer manner.

And from that day forth, all the people from across the world said but one thing, which later became the sole name of the land: "" He Madagascar ! """,Once upon a time was a magical land called Mad'ha,3

One night the couple had plans for a masquerade party, but as the husband was getting ready the wife mentioned that she was not feeling well and would stay home that night.  The husband tried to convince her that she would feel better once she got there but, unable to change her mind, he ended up going by himself.


After about an hour the wife got her costume out and hailed a cab to the party.  Her husband had never seen her outfit before so she had the unique opportunity to observe his behavior when she wasn't around.  Upon entering the party she saw him mingling with scantily clad women, flirting, and being friendlier than she was comfortable with.  Rather than ousting him in the moment, she hung back to see if he would go any further.


After a while the dance floor began to fill up, and she watched as her husband approached several women and began dancing with them in a very vulgar manner, groping several and kissing a few.  At this point the wife decided that she would catch him firsthand, and moved to his general vicinity.


As expected, her husband approached her from behind and began grinding and touching her in all ways imaginable.  After several minutes she suggested that they go someplace more private, and led him to a pantry where he had is way with her.  After he was finished, she told him she needed to freshen up in the bathroom and sneakily exited the party, heading home to prepare herself for the confrontation that would take place when he returned.


After a few hours her husband came home.  As he approached their bed, she pretended to wake up.  ""How was your night?"" she asked, ready to catch him in his lie.


""It was a great night,"" replied the husband.  ""But I'm beat and need to get some rest.""


""Before you go to bed, may I ask if you did anything you shouldn't have at the party?""


""The party was actually pretty boring by myself, so I ended up catching a bus to play cards with the guys soon after arriving.  As luck would have it, my driver was just about to get off his shift so I lent him my costume and gave him the address!""",Unfaithful Husband,85

The first man begins, ""I was recently suspecting my wife of cheating on me. So one day I decided to come home early during my lunch break to check if my suspicions were real. I get to my apartment building and on the elevator ride up I start to get this uneasy feeling. I get to my floor, walk to my door and I hear weird noises coming from inside. I fill with rage and fumble to put my key into the door. I finally am able to open the door and bust into my bedroom. My wife, sitting in her underwear alone on our bed asks me 'what's wrong?' I scream at her 'I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU CHEATING SLUT!' I rush around our apartment looking for the guy while she screams at me to calm down. I don't see him anywhere until I look out onto our balcony. There I see the guy hanging off the railing. I run out and start bashing his hands because obviously I'm filled with rage. He starts screaming and crying and I just kept banging. The fall would have easily killed him, being that it was a 5-6 stories. But this motherfucker won't let go! So I run inside and grab a hammer. I run back out and in one big smash to his fingers, I finally get that asshole to let go and he falls. But you wouldn't fucking believe it...this guy lands in a bush and SURVIVES! I'm so mad I run inside and look for something big to toss over the edge. I see my refrigerator and pick it up. It was insanely heavy but with all that adrenaline pumping, I'm able to get it to the balcony and toss it over the edge. I guess this put a strain on my heart because I immediately had a heart attack and died.""

God admits, that was a pretty terrible way to die. He gestures for the second guy to tell his story.

The second guy says ""ok so I was on my apartment building's roof doing my daily aerobics. I got super into the song I was listening too and wasn't paying attention. I ended up falling over the edge, but I was able to grab onto a balcony railing. What luck! I was so happy but didn't have the strength to pull myself over due to my intensive exercise routine I previously mentioned. Then I see this guy inside and he sees me but what do you know, this guy is raging about his wife cheating on him and he thinks I'm the guy! When he comes outside he starts bashing my fingers and I try my hardest to not let go, screaming at him to stop but to no avail. After realizing I wasn't letting go, he goes inside and runs back out with a hammer! He smashes my fingers and I let go. I think for sure I'm going to die but somehow I landed in a bush. I think to myself 'how lucky I am! That fall should have killed me!' But just as I'm thanking you for saving me, I see this refrigerator tilt over the edge and it falls on me, causing my death.

God says ""wow that is pretty terrible as well. Ok. Third guy what happened to you?""

Third guy says ""ok, imagine yourself naked in a refrigerator...""

He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step. As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump. A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful.

Managing not to yell, Randy sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the hall mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding. He managed to quietly find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a Band-Aid as best he could on each place he saw blood.

He then hid the now almost empty Band-Aid box and shuffled and stumbled his way to bed.

In the morning, Randy woke up with searing pain in both his head and butt and Kathleen staring at him from across the room.

She said, ‘You were drunk again last night, weren’t you?’

Randy said, ‘Why would you say such a mean thing?’

‘Well,’ Kathleen said, ‘it could be the open front door, it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs, it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house, it could be your bloodshot eyes, but mostly ……. it’s all those Band-Aids stuck on the hall mirror.",Randy staggered home very late after another evening with his drinking buddies,11
