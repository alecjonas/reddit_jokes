Much to her dismay, she opened the door to see a grey-haired gentleman sitting in a wheelchair.

He had no arms or legs.

The old woman said, 'You're not really asking me to consider you, are you?  Just look at you ... you have no legs!

The old man smiled, 'Therefore, I cannot run around on you!'

She snorted. 'You don't have any arms either!'

Again, the old man smiled, 'Therefore, I can never beat you!'

She raised an eyebrow and asked intently, 'Are you still good in bed???'

He could juggle them behind his back, he could juggle them blindfolded, he could even juggle them while standing on his head. His skill was unmatched and all of his shows were sold out, no matter what part of the world he performed in.

But he had a secret: his hands were very small and because of it, he could only juggle with a special kit containing custom balls made specially for his tiny hands. Every time he would try to juggle other objects, he would always fail, so he only performed with that kit.

After several years of performing he started noticing that his shows didn't sell out anymore. Every other show there were more and more empty seats. When he asked why, he was told that people were becoming bored with his act of only juggling regular balls when there were other artists out there using more interesting props such as bowling balls, knives, swords, chainsaws, torches and even live animals.

The juggler became depressed. The less popular his shows became, the more he started drinking. All his life he knew how to do only one thing, and that was juggling. After several months of drinking, he had wasted all of his money. The only thing he had left were the clothes he was wearing and the juggling kit. He decided to leave all of his failures behind and become a monk. He sold his juggling kit and used the money to travel to the nearest monastery.

Ten years had passed when the once famous juggler couldn't handle the abstinence anymore. He sneaked out of the monastery and searched for a pub to have a few drinks. Even though he had grown a long beard, the bartender at the pub remembered his face and recognized him:

""Aren't you the juggler who was world famous about 10 years ago?""

""Yes, I am.""

""What happened to you, where did you go all those years back?""

""I became a monk.""

""Well, if you're a monk, why are you drinking?""

""For ten years, I haven't touched a single bottle. For ten years, I haven't touched a single woman. I just can't take it anymore, I want to feel like a normal person again""

The bartender understood his problem and nodded in agreement. He then pointed to a woman sitting at the other end of the pub and said:

""I'm sure she could take care of your second problem. Just show her your juggling skills and she will definitely be impressed.""

The monk responded:

""Yes, I've been thinking about it as well...

...but I don't have the balls to do it.""","Once upon a time, there lived a very famous juggler...",7

When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly: Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight. He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table.

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the
telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the bli
ndfold until he returned and went to answer the call.

The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go.

It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump!

I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage.

Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes.The pleasure was indescribable!

Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself.

My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long.

He asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses.",During lunch at work last week,19

New models are initially fun to own, but very costly to maintain, and horribly expensive to get rid of.

Used models may initially appear to have curb appeal and a low price, but eventually have an increased appetite for fuel, and the curb weight typically increases with age.

Manufacturers are baffled as to how the size of the boot increases, but say that the paint may just make it LOOK bigger.

He promised to give me ""special price."" It was frustrating.

But what was infuriating was when some Brit came into the store with a Big Gulp - both he and the soda were super sweaty - and he put the damned thing on the table I was trying to buy. I was so engrossed with the haggling that I didn't even notice for a couple of minutes. By the time the seller and and I noticed, it had left a giant ring on the table - ruining the damn thing.

So the vendor starts yelling at the Brit - who was the definition of a pretentious rich jackhole - and insisting that he pay for the table. At the original price. And the guy whips out a stack of cash and pays for it. The whole time I'm standing there, mouth agape. Finally, I looked at the seller and asked ""What the hell, man?"" and he gently explained ""If you liked it, you should have put a ring on it. Don't be mad 'cause you see that he want it. If you liked it you should have put a ring on it.""",Haggling in Thailand,1

Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and O. Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneedeep &amp;. Schitt Inc. In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple produced 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins: Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.

Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school drop out. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.

Noe Schitt later married Mr. Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them she wanted to keep her previous name. She was known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock.

Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony.

The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding.

The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new bride, Piza Schitt.

The second bull chimes in, ""I know that's right. He's not touching any of my 250 cows.""

About this time, a large truck pulling a trailer backs in to the ranch and begins to unload a 4,000 pound monster of a bull. He is so big that the steel ramp is bending with every step he takes.

The youngest bull begins huffing and grunting and scraping the ground with his foot. The oldest bull looks at him and says ""Son, use your head. Give up a few cows and live to tell about it.""

**Context:** In Romania there is a region called Transylvania, which represents 1/3 of the country that was under Hungarian occupation for about 50 years. Now it is a part of Romania, but there is a lot of Hungarian population living there that still dreams about being an independent country, so they consider themselves Hungarians, Romanians call them Hungarians, but they are in fact Romanians with Hungarian names. Obviously this is a source for a lot of conflicts and jokes in our country, like the one below.)

**----------------------------------------**

There was this Hungarian guy and he was to be married with a Romanian girl and his father instructs the guy how to act with his young bride:

- When you get in front of the door with your bride, lift her up in your arms so she can see the Hungarian is STRONG, then get in the room and throw her on the bed contemptuously so she can see the Hungarian is PROUD, then you get naked in front of her so she can see the Hungarian is HANDSOME and then you know what you have to do, right?

- Right dad, says the young groom.

The next day they meet and the father asks the son about his wedding night.  And he starts describing his night:

- Well, I crossed her over the doorstep in my arms to show her that I am strong. Then I threw her on the bed contemptuously to show her I am proud, then I got naked to show her I am handsome and then I masturbated in front of her.

- What the fuck??? Why would you do that? the father asks

- To show her that the Hungarian is INDEPENDENT and AUTONOMOUS, of course ...

**----------------------------------------**

Also I am Romanian, and my new boyfriend is Hungarian, and after the first night of sex I just couldn't stop myself from saying this after the deed was done:

- Not so  INDEPENDENT and AUTONOMOUS now, are you?

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla. About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lions den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, “OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?”

“No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.” So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise’s door and Tom Cruise shouts, “Dave! What’s happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!

Although impressed, Dave’s boss is still sceptical. After they leave Cruise’s house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. “No, no, just name anyone else,” Dave says.

“President Bush,” his boss quickly retorts.

“Yup,” Dave says, “Old buddies, let’s fly out to Washington.” And off they go.
At the White House, Bush spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, “Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let’s have a cup of coffee first and catch up.”

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.

After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

“The Pope,” his boss replies.

“Sure!” says Dave. “I’ve known the Pope for years.” So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican when Dave says,”This will never work. I can’t catch the Pope’s eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I’ll come out on the balcony with the Pope.”

He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has passed out and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss’ side, Dave asks him, “What happened?”

His boss looks up and says, “It was the final straw – you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, “Who the hell is that on the balcony with Dave?”",Dave was bragging to his boss one day,49

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your Business at this convention?”

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best.

One of them was, quite frankly, stupid, while the other was very sharp indeed. In fact, he was a master of ready wit and stunning repartee.

One evening the stupid twin went to a circus that happened to be in town. He went early so he could get a good seat in the front row, right beside the ring, and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. He marvelled at the elephants, cowered from the lions, and gaped at the trapeze artists in their skimpy costumes; he reacted exactly the way he was meant to.

Last of all, on came the clowns. They were his favourite bit of the circus. All that falling over, all that water, all those custard pies - it was hilarious. The lead clown was the most ludicrous of the lot: he had bigger shoes, baggier trousers, brighter make-up and the most enormous red nose. And part of the lead clown's job was to make fun of people in the audience.

So the clown looked around for someone to hassle, and saw a rather stupid-looking man sitting right in the front row. Ideal. He went up to the stupid twin and said:

""Sir, are you the front end of an ass?""

The stupid man sat there wishing that he hadn't come, wishing that the clown would go away and pick on someone else. He knew he wasn't very intelligent, and he knew he would come out of this looking very foolish. But he spoke up. ""No,"" he said.

""Sir, are you the back end of an ass?"" the clown continued.

""No, I'm not,"" the stupid man replied.

""Then, sir,"" the clown said slowly, letting the audience savour the moment, ""you are no end of an ass!""

The audience, having a fairly poor sense of humour, erupted into laughter. The stupid man just wished he could die. Fortunately for him, the show was soon over.

When he got home, the stupid man told his brother what had happened.

""Don't worry,"" said the master of ready wit and stunning repartee, ""I am a master of ready wit and stunning repartee. Tomorrow night I will go to the circus and make that clown look foolish.""

So the next night, the master of ready wit and stunning repartee went to the circus, and got a front row seat. Being an intelligent man, he was considerably less impressed by the sight of dumb animals being made to do tricks, although he had to admit that the trapeze artists were rather tasty.

Then the clowns came out, and the one with the biggest shoes, baggiest trousers, brightest make-up and most ludicrously over-sized nose looked around the audience for someone to make fun of. He could not believe his luck. There, sitting in the front row, was the stupid man he'd got such a laugh out of the night before. So the clown approached the master of ready wit and stunning repartee and asked:

""Sir, are you the front end of an ass?""

""No,"" said the master of ready wit and stunning repartee.

""Sir, are you the back end of an ass?"" the clown continued.

""No, I'm not,"" replied the master of ready wit and stunning repartee.

""Then, sir,"" said the clown, ""you are no end of an ass!"" The crowd went wild with laughter. The joke went down even better than it had the night before, and the clown felt on top of the world.

But just then the master of ready wit and stunning repartee stood up, smiled sadistically and said:

""Fuck off, you red-nosed bastard.""",Once upon a time there were two identical twins,7

He said, ""No, really! Just turn on your TV tonight to the Inaugural Ball. You'll see me.""

Not long after, I was talking to Larry about how much I like Jennifer Lawrence. Larry said, ""Oh, she's a good friend of mine."" I said, ""Noooo!"" Larry said, ""C’mon"". He drove me to Jennifer Lawrence’s house, where she opened the door, exclaimed “Larry!”, gave him a big hug and invited us in for drinks.

This was getting spooky. Larry seemed to know everyone! While at an Arnold Schwarzenegger press conference, just before the Governator started answering questions, he said ""Hey, I see my friend Larry out there!""

I was already pretty impressed, but then one day, when Larry and I were having drinks and watching the news, Larry saw the Pope on TV and said something about their being friends.  I said, ""You can't know the Pope, too!""  Larry said, ""Wanna bet?"" 

Larry happens to be very well off, so he flew the both of us to Rome. We took a cab to St. Peters Square. We were standing in the big crowd below the balcony of the Pope's apartment. Larry said, ""Excuse me for a little while"" and disappeared into the crowd.

A little while after that, Pope Francis appeared on the balcony and started blessing people. And who should be up there beside him but...you guessed it…Larry!

I was utterly amazed! I nudged a guy standing next to me, pointed to the balcony, and said, ""Look!""  The guy shaded his eyes with his palm, peered up at the balcony, turned back to me, and said, ""Who's that guy up there with Larry?""

As he settled in, he glanced up and saw the most beautiful woman boarding the plane. He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat. As fate would have it, she took The seat right beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation he blurted out, “Business trip or pleasure?”

She turned, smiled and said, “Business. I’m going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston.""

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your Business at this convention?”

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with Absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.”

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. “I’m Sorry,” she said, “I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don’t Even know your name.”

“Tonto,” the man said, “Tonto Gonzales, but my friends call me Bubba"".

China and the Soviet Union are on the brink of open hostilities. The war would kill us all. And only the pope can save the day.

Well, so thinks Richard Nixon.

See, he'd been up all night watching *The Shoes of the Fisherman*, and it was such a harrowing vision that he was determined that the pope, and only the pope, could broker a deal between two hostile nations. If you've not seen *The Shoes of the Fisherman*, it's a fine film with Anthony Quinn and there's international problems solved by the pope. 

Anyways, Nixon rings up the Vatican and convinces the pope that he has to come to New York to visit the UN. Due to the tenuous situation, this visit has to be utterly secret. ""It's *brrrrrrrrrrr* gotta be secret your holiness!"" They've got a room for him at the Waldorf, it'll be a one day visit. Get in, get out, get a t-shirt.

The pope, who hadn't been to America in a good long while, accepts this mission. He throws on his red hat and cape, and he hustles to a cab stand.

""Where to?"" asks the cabbie. The pope stammers, ""just...just get me to Roma International please.""

They drive in silence, and the cabbie looks in his rearview.

""Heyyyy...now wait-a minute! (the cabbie has an Italian accent. This isn't easily explainable) I a-know you! You..you're a famous man!""

The pope, terrified of breaking his cover before he's even left Rome, looks away and mutters, ""No, no I'm not, must be someone else.""

""Noooo! I a-seen you on the tv! Red hat...red cape...OH! You are Elvis Presley!""

""I assure you, I am not Elvis Presley!"" says the pope, feelings a little hurt.

""Yes-a you are! You do the shuffles and the music, oh my wife gonna be so jealous!""

The pope scuttles out of the cab at the airport and hurries to the ticket counter. He orders a round trip to JFK, and the man at the ticket counter looks up and gasps.

""Signore! Don't I know you? Mama mia, I seen you on television last night!""

""No, sir. I assure you I'm nobody of any importance.""

""Yes you are! You got the cape...you got the hat...oh madonna you are ELVIS PRESLEY!"" He starts to squeal and hit the counter.

""SIR! PLEASE! Just...just get me a ticket to JFK!""

On the plane. 

Pope's got his bible out, going over some choice passages, and the stewardess bringing coffee nearly drops it in his lap, crying, ""Elvis! Elvis Presley is on my plane!""

The pope hisses at her to be quiet and could she please bring some more peanuts.

Harried and exhausted, he gets a cab at JFK. ""Waldorf Astoria, please.""

The cabbie, and we're talkin' the quintessential Brooklyn cabbie here, chews on his cigar and lifts his cap and says, ""Sweet Jesus on a bus to Greenpoint! You're famous, ain't ya?""

The pope is nearly reduced to tears at this point. The cabbie continues. ""You got dat red hat! You got the fancy uptown lady cape, only one man has the balls to carry that off, you're Elvis Presley!""

At the Waldorf, it all happens again. The clerk says, ""here's the key to your room!"" And in a sotto vocce whisper that echoes across the lobby, ""*..mister Presley*!""

The pope goes up to his room. He wishes the president had never watched *The Shoes of the Fisherman*. He turns the key in the lock.

Two young chambermaids are making up his room. They spin to face him and erupt in shrieks. ""Oh my god! It's....it's....ELVIS!"" One flops on the bed and the other starts to slowly unlace her uniform.

The pope looks down, buries his head in his hands, comes up and says,

In 2005, due to budget cutbacks the US army decided to start combining military occupational specialties within the computer science field into new MOSs. Soldiers that joined the army to write software now had to also know hardware. Soldiers that wanted to install cabling now also had to install fiber optic networking. Officers had to learn their new responsibilities just as their soldiers did in order to maintain a good work force. 

In 2008, more budget cutbacks caused the same thing to happen. The soldiers doing hardware and software now had to learn how to install fiber optic cabling and do networking. Officers had to manage these new soldiers, but all worked out well.  

In 2010, more cutbacks resulted in those same soldiers having to install network cabling that follow industry standard and insure all work is kept up to code. Officers took note and made sure their soldiers did their jobs correctly given the new responsibilities.

In 2015, more budget cutbacks caused the MOSs to only be available to the officer core. All of the titles have been combined to a single position typically filled by a single lieutenant.  Every unit gets only one of these types of computer science officers. When the army needs support for hardware, software or any other computer type support they call the Software, Hardware, Information Technology, Industry Fiber-optic Installation &amp; Networking Officer or SHITIFINO for short.

With that, the guy went to the back room and spent the better part of the night playing cards with some of the locals. After many hours of drinking and card playing, he stumbled up to the bar. Drunk as a skunk, he said, ""Bartender, I'll give you one last chance. I'll bet you five hundred dollars that I can stand on this bar on one foot and piss into that whiskey bottle on that shelf behind you without spilling a drop.""

The bartender once again pondered the bet. The guy couldn't even stand up straight on two feet, much less one. ""Okay, you're on,"" he said.

The guy climbed up on the bar, stood on one leg, and began pissing all over the place. He hit the bar, the bartender, himself, but not a drop made it into the whiskey bottle.

The bartender was ecstatic. Laughing, the bartender said, ""Hey pal, you owe me five hundred dollars!""

The guy climbed down off the bar and said, ""That's okay. I just bet each of the guys in the card room a thousand bucks each that I could piss all over you and the bar and still make you laugh.""",The Gambler,59

outside New York City when his engine
stalled. He quickly determined that his battery
was dead and managed to stop another driver
who consented to push his car to get it started.
“My car has an automatic transmission,”
he explained, “so you’ll have to get up to 30
or 35 miles an hour to get me started.”
The second motorist nodded and walked
back to his own car. The first motorist climbed
back into his car and waited for the good
Samaritan to pull up behind him. He waited—
and waited. Finally, he turned around to see
what was wrong.
There was the good Samaritan—coming
up behind his car at about 35 miles an hour!
The damage amounted to $3,800.",Joke from my management book,2

The first friend brings the loaded gun, and announces: ""Three bullets, one for each of us. Let's see who luck favors!"" They all give an affirming nod, and the first brings the muzzle to his temple, and pulls the trigger. Blood, bone and brain spray out to accompany the loud bang.

""Good times, eh, buddy?"" With a pull of the trigger, a familiar sound echoes off the walls as they are painted in gore.  
The remaining friend looks to the bodies of the other two with a smile. ""Well, here's hoping that even if I win this round, I don't have to wait too long to see you both again."" He grabs the grip, and takes his turn.
