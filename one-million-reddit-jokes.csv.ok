The DJs play a game where they award winners great prizes. The game is called 'Mate Match'. The DJs call someone at work and ask if they are married or seriously involved with someone. If the contestant answers 'yes', he or she is then asked 3 random yet highly personal questions. The person is also asked to divulge the name of their partner with (phone number) for verification. If their partner answers those same three questions correctly, they both win the prize.

The city dropped to its knees with laughter and is possibly the funniest thing you've heard yet.

Anyway, here's how it all went down:

DJ: 'Hey! This is Ed on FOX-FM. Have you ever heard of 'Mate Match'?'

Contestant: (laughing) 'Yes, I have.'

DJ: 'Great! Then you know we're giving away a trip to the Gold Coast if you win. What is your name? First only please.'

Contestant: 'Brian.'

DJ: 'Brian, are you married or what?'

Brian: (laughing nervously) 'Yes, I am married.'

DJ: 'Thank you. Now, what is your wife's name? First only please.'

Brian: 'Sarah.'

DJ: 'Is Sarah at work, Brian?'

Brian: 'She is gonna kill me.'

DJ: 'Stay with me here, Brian! Is she at work?'

Brian: (laughing) 'Yes, she's at work.'

DJ: 'Okay, the first question - when was the last time you had sex?'

Brian: 'About 8 o'clock this morning.'

DJ: 'Atta boy, Brian.'

Brian: (laughing sheepishly) 'Well...'

DJ: 'Question #2 - How long did it last?'

Brian: 'About 10 minutes.'

DJ: 'Wow! You really want that trip, huh? No one would ever have said that if a trip wasn't at stake.'

Brian: 'Yeah, that trip sure would be nice.'

DJ: 'Okay. Final question. Where did you have sex at 8 o'clock this morning?

Brian: (laughing hard) 'I, ummm, I, well...'

DJ: 'This sounds good, Brian. Where was it at?'

Brian: 'Not that it was all that great, but her mum is staying with us for couple of weeks...'

DJ: 'Uh huh...'

Brian: '...and the Mother-In-Law was in the shower at the time.'

DJ: 'Atta boy, Brian.'

Brian: 'On the kitchen table.'

DJ: 'Not that great?? That is more adventure than the previous hundred times I've done it. Okay folks, I will put Brian on hold, get his wife's work number and call her up. You listen to this.' 

[ 3 minutes of commercials follow. ]

DJ: 'Okay audience; let's call Sarah, shall we?' (Touch tones .....ringing....)

Clerk: 'Kinkos.'

DJ: 'Hey, is Sarah around there somewhere?'

Clerk: 'This is she.'

DJ: 'Sarah, this is Ed with FOX-FM. We are live on the air right now and I've been talking with Brian for a couple of hours now.'

Sarah: (laughing) 'A couple of hours?'

DJ: 'Well, a while now. He is on the line with us. Brian knows not to give any answers away or you'll lose. Sooooooo... do you know the rules of 'Mate Match'?'

Sarah: 'No.'

DJ: 'Good!'

Brian: (laughing)

Sarah: (laughing) 'Brian, what the hell are you up to?'

Brian: (laughing) 'Just answer his questions honestly, okay? Be completely honest.'

DJ: 'Yeah yeah yeah. Sure. Now, I will ask you 3 questions, Sarah. If your answers match Brian's answers, then the both of you will be off to the Gold Coast for 5 days on us.

Sarah: (laughing) 'Yes.'

DJ: 'Alright. When did you last have sex, Sarah?'

Sarah: 'Oh God, Brian....uh, this morning before Brian went to work.'

DJ: 'What time?'

Sarah: 'Around 8 this morning.'

DJ: 'Very good. Next question. How long did it last?'

Sarah: '12, 15 minutes maybe.'

DJ: 'Hmmmm. That's close enough. I am sure she is trying to protect his manhood. We've got one last question, Sarah. You are one question away from a trip to the Gold Coast. Are you ready?'

Sarah: (laughing) 'Yes.'

DJ: 'Where did you have it?'

Sarah: 'OH MY GOD, BRIAN!! You didn't tell them that did you?'

Brian: 'Just tell him, honey.'

DJ: 'What is bothering you so much, Sarah?'

Sarah: 'Well...'

DJ: Come on Sarah.....where did you have it?

Sarah: 'Up the arse'

After much prayer and consideration, they concluded the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the
baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Methodist church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist Church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water slide.

But the Catholic Church came up with a very creative strategy. They baptized all the squirrels and consecrated them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.

Not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue; they took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since.",The Squirrels vs. The Church,16

‘Well, in that case, I’ll just look the other way,’ said the nun.

Thinking about their problem, the zookeeper thought of Jimmy Bob Walton, a rural part-time worker responsible for cleaning the animal cages. Jimmy Bob had little sense but he possessed ample ability to satisfy a female of any species. 

The zookeeper thought they might have a solution, and they approached Jimmy Bob with a proposition; Would he be willing to mate with the gorilla for $500? Jimmy Bob showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. 

The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under four conditions: 

""First,"" Jimmy Bob said, ""I ain't a-kissin' her on the mouth."" The keeper quickly agreed to this condition.

Working on a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to walk the aisles, checking passenger's tickets! Unfortunately, one day he slipped and grabbed the emergency brake, causing the train to crash. He made it out alright, but a person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back working on the train. He was so excited that he would walk even faster, checking tickets and not paying enough attention to his balance. Once again, he slipped, pulled the brake and caused the train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack.""

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least.""

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know.""

""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious
again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with
his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it
to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his
shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?""

""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
Like he had a lot to think about.""

""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body
tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll
turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes,
straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there.
With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot
in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's ""Just Kidding!"" right before he felt the
now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.

Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet
extending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to
the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been
recently bitten.

Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped
bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever,
his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he
was still awake.

Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he
thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.

""Nate, do accidents count?""

Nate lifted his head a little bit. ""What do you mean, Jack?""

Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. ""You know,
accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does
that still wipe out humanity?""

""Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that
if you start feeling wobbly,"" said Nate with some amusement.

A little later - ""Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?"" asked Jack.

""That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it,"" answered Nate.

""No,"" Jack shook his head, ""I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull
the lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a
rock?""

""Yes, those should work,"" replied Nate. ""Though I'm not sure how complicated
you could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote
control for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by
the next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that
in the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they
wouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or
whatever had disappeared.""

""Wow,"" said Jack, ""Cool."" Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him
off of the stone and looked up into the sky.

""Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too,
right?"" asked Jack.

""Yes,"" replied Nate, ""it was. He lived 167 years, Jack.""

""Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long.
Do you know what he died of, Nate?""

""He died of getting tired of living, Jack,"" Nate said, sounding somewhat
sad.

Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.

Nate looked back. ""Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in
society. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start
questioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He
faked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and
he could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he
liked the attention. Most of the time, anyway.

""His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't
stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend
time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he
told me he'd had enough. It was his time.""

""And then he just died?"" asked Jack.

Nate shook his head a little. ""He made his forth request, Jack. There's only
one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.

After a bit Nate continued, ""He told me that he was tired, that it was his
time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always
had.

After another pause, Nate finished, ""Samuel's body disappeared off the stone
with the sunrise.""

Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his
memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.

Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with
the morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except
that his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.

So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to
get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long
walk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made
it back easily.

Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,
little worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert
and walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with
a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV.
They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without
incident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's
lever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it.

Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a
book store, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to
avoid any more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see
Nate.

Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new
backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then
started walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he
knew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,
and shouldn't really raise suspicions.

Jack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.
Some things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,
others that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate,
and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but
that he had things to do first.

Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought
a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,
special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a
special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot
rattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out
its location to the satellite.

After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him
fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.

After the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he
'd been given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years,
working in a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile
any more. Jack went back to school.

Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps
because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote,
and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started
traveling around the country for book signings and readings.

But, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.

On one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been
a fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing
Samuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace
Samuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this
visit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at
Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's
silence, sat down and waited.

After a few minutes, Nate spoke. ""Jack, I have someone to introduce you to.""

Jack looked surprised. ""Someone to introduce me to?"" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. ""This something to do with the Big Guy?

""No, no,"" replied Nate. ""This is more personal. I want you to meet my son.""
Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. ""Sammy!""

Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the
dune and up to the stone base of the lever.

""Yo, Jack,"" said the new, much smaller snake.

""Yo, Sammy"" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. ""Named after Samuel, I
assume?""

Nate nodded. ""Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around
for me?"" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the
edge of the stone and looked across the sands. ""When Samuel first told me
about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the
other deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to
have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been.

""He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have
that. Think you can do that for me, Jack?""

Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even
joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. ""Yeah, I can
do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?"" Jack could sense that was
something more.

Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,
""Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet
ya!"" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.

Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. ""Jack, this is my
first son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to
know what it took for me to find a mate."" Nate grinned to himself. ""But
anyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I
needed a replacement.""

Jack considered this for a minute. ""So, you're ready to come see the world,
and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?""

Nate shook his head. ""No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've
already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave
here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die.""

Jack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about
this - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would
be like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another
hundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself.
Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said
was, ""What do you want me to do?""

Nate nodded. ""Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around
the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here
and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.

""I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of
old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now.
I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be
able to die. And I need you to kill me.

""I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And
I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so
that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.

Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. ""I'd
say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground
or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of
going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,
even on me.

""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that.""

Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy!
Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack.""

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it
back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then
headed into the desert with Sammy following.
Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through
e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting
every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a
natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up
acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to
keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were
nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a
few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle
them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few
wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the
newspapers or the public in general.

When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some
undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally
drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was
stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that
Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans
could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.

So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told
Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from
his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to
Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by
getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as
much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was
definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to
head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he
and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up
Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those
years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like
walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to
figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either
have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.

As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his
resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was
only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks
afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they
drove, and then they could get it over tonight.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of
sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out
into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been
nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,
revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to
the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed
up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd
decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing
traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to
keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the
other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and
laughing at Jack's driving.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw
that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,
waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV
started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped
the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and
faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were
heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for
it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end
humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't
working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,
Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the
lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit
the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer
away.

Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a
little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just
right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the
sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that
they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something
else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped
around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the
stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of
the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV
was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the
sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the
lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the
lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy
realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.
Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""BETTER NATE THAN LEVER,"" he ran over the snake.

PLEASE READ:
 
This joke was also a  personality profile test...

  It was the subject of a recent Educational Psychology Master's Thesis, soon to be published, which investigated the way that someone responds to a webpage such as this  correlates to certain personality tendencies.

The research confirmed a statistically significant correlation which strongly suggests a dependably predictive positive relationship between how a person responds to this page and certain aspects of his or her psychological profile. Thus, it is called the Personality Profile Assessment Test Hypothesis.

While the actual results looked at several complex factors, and depended heavily on questionnaires filled out by volunteers upon completion of their experience, I will simplify the results by discussing three main groups and their profiles. While these profiles may not be exactly fitting of each person within each group, they do strongly suggest a statistically significant likelihood of profile similarity.



11% of those who see this page take their time, enjoying the joke as they read it, enjoying the build up to the punch line, and even if the punch line itself wasn’t particularly humorous, they tended to enjoy the process.



56% begin scroll down to the punch line either before starting to read the joke or within a short period of time- usually 20 seconds or less. The vast majority of this group choose not to read the joke.


33% read at least 1/3 of the joke, with the intention of reading it all, but then begin to question their decision and the investment of time they are making. They go back and forth between deciding to continuing or to skip to the end (this vacillating may be unconscious at the time, and happen in a matter of moments). The vast majority in this group give up before finishing ½ of the joke, and scroll to the end.

People in the first group, who read the entire joke, tend to enjoy the journey of life, and take their time as they move towards a goal. When traveling, they tend to thoroughly enjoy the process, and are not uptight or stressed about single-mindedly getting to their destination.  They also tend to be very attentive, patient and long lasting lovers, and enjoy intimacy and physical connectivity whether or not it is carried to completion.

Those in the second group, who scroll to the end before reading more than a few sentences of the joke, tend to avoid surprises and the unknown. They prefer to have a regular schedule and not to step out of their routine. They tend to be efficient, but are often lacking in enjoyment, spontaneity and passion. They tend to be less patient and more interested in the destination than the journey. When on a trip, they tend to focus on getting where they are going, rather than enjoying the process. During intimacy, they tend to not be able to enjoy it unless they are certain it will be taken to completion.  The idea of just “playing around” a while, engaging in physical intimacy without the promise of full completion is, rather than simply enjoyable and connective, considered to be “cruel” and a “teasing” and is met with resentment. This group’s ability to enjoy depends largely on their need to know what is going to happen. They tend to be more self-focused lovers, and tend not to last very long in satisfying the other partner if their own satisfaction has happened or is within easy reach.  

The third group, who decided not to read the entire joke after reading a third or more of it, tend to be commitment-phobic and lack the ability to move forward to completion when things become challenging. They are often procrastinators and frequently give up on tasks when they become more difficult. They tend to prefer to have big dreams than act on them in the real, challenging world. A significantly higher percentage of this group had Cesarean birth, and may not have had the benefit of that early experience of struggle and effort being rewarded with accomplishment. This group tends to not take big vacations which would take more effort to plan and implement, and tends to stay close to home or even stay home during time off. Promotions and career moves which are within reach but still require some effort and focus are frequently not fully tried for, although the perception will be they were passed up.  In intimate relationships, this group tends to start out romantic and passionate, but it quickly fades and is replaced by lackadaisicalness and indifference, characterized in part by a sense of feeling it is not worth the effort to continue having a passionate, energized and complete experience during intimacy. There is a tendency to “peter out” both in intimacy and in other aspects of life, and to take the easier road, even if it leads to a less fulfilling life.

She then whipped out her cell phone and showed me a picture of a Lamborghini ""You see this car? I paid for it by selling hand jobs.""

She leaves and I pass out. The next night I go back to the same casino bar, and sure enough she's there again and I decide I wanted some more. I walk up to her and say ""You were amazing last night, how much would it cost for a blow job?"" She then smiles and says ""1 grand."" Again I'm a little bit set back by the price and I said ""A grand? Is it that good?"" She then whips out her phone and shows me a picture of a HUGE, luxurious house. She then says ""See this house? I paid for it with blowjobs"" so I said ""Alright let's do it"" so this time we go into her car and she decides to blow me in the parking lot, and its the best blowjob I ever had.
We sit there and I'm blown away by this woman, so I ask her, ""how much would it cost for some pussy?"" She then laughs and points to the casino. ""You see that casino?"" I said ""...yeah?"" She says ""If I had a pussy, I would own that casino.""

And despite being offered jobs in management, he was committed to staying in sales despite the  large amount of money that being a manager would earn. He loved to sell paper with all his heart. There was one complication, however. Although he was very passionate, he had a lisp, which sometimes made making a sale more difficult. Nevertheless, his personality was able to get him loyal customers who loved to talk to him and buy his paper.

One day, a new manager came in. A strong-armed Northeasterner, he was there to ramp up sales from all the staff. He told them in a bold voice, ""Everyone has to sell 100 extra reams of paper today. If you don't, you're fired.""

She thinks about this for a few seconds, then agrees and proceeds to jump up and down topless in front of the old man.

Now vibrant, the old man grabs another photo and says “here, look, this is my yacht off of the coast of Gibraltar.” “It’s yours, if you could just let me play with those spiffing breasts of yours for a couple of minutes.”

One of the lawyers asks, ""How are you going to travel with just a ticket between the three of you?""
""Watch and you'll see,"" winks one of the engineers.
The train arrives, and the six of them climb on. The three lawyers take their seats while the three engineers pile into a bathroom. The train gets underway.
A conductor starts making his rounds. Noticing the bathroom is occupied, he knocks on the door and asks, ""Ticket, please.""
The door cracks open a hair, and a single ticket is offered. The conductor punches it, and continues on.
The three lawyers admit that this is a good trick, and that they should try it on their next journey. As luck would have it, after spending a few days in Chicago, they see that the three engineers will be on board their train. The lawyers purchase a single ticket for the three of them, while the engineers don't buy a ticket at all.
One of the lawyers asks, ""How are you going to ride, if you don't have a ticket?""
""Watch and you'll see,"" came the reply.

Within a few weeks the gorilla, a female, became very difficult to handle. Upon examination, the veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there was no male gorilla available. 

Thinking about their problem, the Zoo Keeper thought of Bobby Lee Walton, a redneck part-time worker responsible for cleaning the animal cages. Bobby Lee, like most rednecks, had little sense but possessed ample ability to satisfy a female of any species. 

The Zoo Keeper thought they might have a solution. Bobby Lee was approached with a proposition. Would he be willing to mate with the gorilla for $500? 

Bobby Lee showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under five conditions: 

""First"", Bobby Lee said, ""I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips."" The Keeper quickly agreed to this condition. 

""Second"", he said, ""She must wear a 'Dale Earnhardt Forever' T-Shirt."" The keeper again readily agreed to this condition. 

""Third"", he said, ""you can't never tell no one about this."" The keeper obviously agreed to this condition. 

""Fourth"", Bobby Lee said, ""I want all the children raised Southern Baptist."" Once again it was agreed. 

""And last,"" Bobby Lee said, ""I'll need another week to come up with the $500.""",West Virginia Zoo just got a new gorilla!,127

He just had to find out what his secret was. 

About an hour goes by and he looks over and the group of women appeared to be leaving, he's pretty well drunk at this point and he see's what may be his last chance to  ask the guy what his secret is.

When he opens it, he is confronted by a little Japanese man, clutching a clipboard and yelling, ""You Sign! You sign!"" Behind him is an enormous truck full of car exhausts.

Nelson is standing there in complete amazement, when the Japanese man starts to yell louder: ""You sign! You sign!""

Nelson says to him, ""Look, you've obviously got the wrong man"", and shuts the door in his face.

The next day he hears a knock at the door again. When he opens it, the little Japanese is back with a huge truck of brake pads. He thrusts his clipboard under Nelson's nose, yelling, ""You sign! You sign!""

Mr. Mandela is getting a bit hacked off by now, so he pushes the little Japanese man back, shouting: ""Look, go away! You've got the wrong man! I don't want them!"" Then he slams the door in his face again.

The following day, Nelson is resting, and late in the afternoon, he hears a knock on the door again. On opening it, there is the same little Japanese thrusting a clipboard under his nose, shouting, ""You sign! You sign!""

Behind him are TWO very large trucks full of car parts. This time Nelson loses his temper completely, he picks up the little man by his shirt front and yells at him; ""Look, I don't want these! Do you understand? You must have the wrong name! Who do you want to give these to?

After a conference on a Friday, he decides to check out a local bar. He sits down at the bar and orders a beer. While drinking at the bar, he takes in all of the scenery. He notices that behind him, there is a large painted barrel, with a locked lid. Painted on the barrel is ""pay $100, win it all!"".

This has piqued his interest, so he asks the bartender:

""What's the deal with the barrel?""

The bartender replies ""You place $100 in the slot on top of the barrel, and if you complete 3 tasks, you will win all of the money."" 

""Well what are the 3 tasks?"" The man asks.

""First, you must knock out the 6'4 295 lb bouncer over there. Once complete, I will give you a pair of pliers. You see this door behind me? I will send you in with the pliers, and you will find a large pitbull. You are to pull out 1 of its teeth, and bring that tooth to me. Once that is finished, you will go upstairs to find a 97 year old woman. You will have sex with her. If you can do all 3 of those things, the money is yours.""

The man drinks for several more hours and is pretty drunk. He decides that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, since he will probably never be here again.

""Fuck it!"" He says as he throws a $100 bill into the barrel. The bartender rings a bell, and the bouncer approaches. The man chugs the rest of his beer and slips as he approaches the bouncer. His mug flies from his hand and smashes into the face of the bouncer, who falls to the floor unconsciously.

""While not the most conventional method, I suppose technically that counts."" Says the bartender.

By this point, the entire bar is silent and watching as the man receives the pliers from the bartender. The man slowly opens the door, walks through, and the bartender closes the door behind him. It is so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone listens intently as the silence is broken.

Screams from the man and loud barking erupt from behind the door for a few moments, and then silence again. After a few seconds, yelping and whimpering can be heard.

The door opens, and the man drunkenly stumbles out. His clothes are tattered and bloody. Breathing heavily, he stumbles up to the bartender with pliers in hand and says:

""Now where is this old woman whose teeth I have to pull!?""",So a guy walks into a bar...,3

She was a tough cookie though, that Mrs. Wallace, and luckily she was just fine. The imam speaks of a newcomer to the mosque who's been having trouble memorizing the prayers, so he's been staying after to help him. He's a really nice boy - young, hardworking, polite.

The two chatter on like this, and after a while the bartender comes over and asks what they'd like. The priest orders a scotch on the rocks, and the imam takes a Coke. They decided to try somewhere new today; normally they'd head over to Hop, Scotch, and a Jump, but today they were feeling a little adventurous, so they found themselves sitting in this new bar: The Sleeping Dragon. But like clockwork, they nursed their drinks, as well as their conversation, for a good two hours before the usual ""Well I guess it's that time again"". They downed the last droplets clinging to the inside of their glasses, and the imam dropped a ten dollar bill on the counter - it was his turn to pay. They started heading for the door when suddenly, the bartender called to them, confused: ""Hey, isn't there supposed to be a rabbi?""",A priest and an imam,3

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. 

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. 

The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!

With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

A storm descends on a small town, and the downpour soon turns into a flood. As the waters rise, the local preacher kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by water. By and by, one of the townsfolk comes up the street in a canoe.

""Better get in, Preacher. The waters are rising fast.""

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Still the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.

""Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.""

Once again, the preacher is unmoved. ""I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.""

After a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.

""Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he drowns.

A pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, ""Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped away from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The Legend of the Three Kingdoms,43

After all the background checks, interviews and testing were done, there were 3 finalists. For the final test, the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. 'We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.'

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair . . . Kill her and make it look like it was not an assassination!!' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow and zipping up his pants. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'I had to strangle the bitch to death, I then had sex with her body to make it look like it was a rape, I bet we can blame it on that Mexican nacho vendor outside. "" he laughed.

The two agents looked at each other in absolute horror.

""Oh my G..! Sir! You are way way to sadistic, violent and racist...even for us. Just leave now!""

The man left the building in absolute anger, knocking out the girl at the reception when she tried to say goodbye to him. 

Just as he was leaving the building a guy in a suit and pitch black sunglasses approached.

""I heard about your little stunt in there. I think I might have the job for you...have you ever heard of United Airlines?""

Here is his astute answer:

When you marry the right woman, you are COMPLETE. When you marry the wrong woman, you are FINISHED. And when the right one catches you with the wrong one, you are COMPLETELY FINISHED!!!

The couple found themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.

While waiting, they began to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven?

When St. Peter showed up, they asked him. St. Peter said, ""I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,'"" and he left.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple were still waiting.

While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if their marriage didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven?

After yet another month, St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled. ""Yes,"" he informed the couple, ""You can get married in Heaven.""


""Great!"" said the couple, ""But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?""


St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground.


""What's wrong?"" asked the frightened couple.


""OH, COME ON!,"" St. Peter shouted,

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair . . . Kill her!!' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow.

The tribe captures the men and they are taken to the chief of the tribe. The chief says, ""We are an old and ancient tribe, with enough knowledge and intellect to rival that of your modern society. Therefore, we see it as unfair to kill you without giving you a chance at survival. Here's the game. You tell us something that you want us to bring, and if we are unable to deliver it to you, we will let you go. Otherwise, we will kill you, eat you, and then use your skin to make leather for canoes.""

The men think this over, and realizing that they have no choice, the first man requests that the cannibals bring him the Mona Lisa, expecting the quest to be impossible without capture. The chief sends his right hand man to retrieve the painting, and a few days later, he returns with the masterpiece tucked under one arm. So the first man is killed and eaten, and his skin is used to make a canoe. 

The second man, seeing the first man's failure, requests for a rock from the moon. The chief once again sends his right hand man, who returns a month later with a moon rock, having hitchhiked a NASA space mission. So the second man is also killed, eaten, and his skin is used to make a canoe.

The third man sees the death of his two companions, and thinks for days and nights about what item he will request. When the chief finally asks him what his item will be, the third man simply asks for a metal fork. Confused, the chief sends his right hand man to go to the nearest store and buy a cheap, aluminum fork. When the fork is shown to the man, the chief asks, ""Here is the fork you requested. Why did you choose such an easy object?"" The third man does not respond, and instead grabs the fork and begins stabbing himself repeatedly all over his body, shouting ""NO CANOE FOR YOU, MUTHAFUKAS!!!""",Three men are captured by cannibals,3

post,67lu8p,2qh72,jokes,false,1493180051,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/67lu8p/the_purple_wombat/,self.jokes,,"There was a little boy by the name of Billy. Billy was an ordinary little boy who did ordinary little boy things, like playing, eating, bathing, destroying things, and going to school. One day, when Billy went down to the bus stop to meet the bus to go to school, he found all of his friends huddled around in a little group, talking about the Purple Wombat.

Being a little boy, Billy was curious. So he asked them, ""What's the Purple Wombat?""

""You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" the children exclaimed disgustedly. For the rest of the morning, they would not go near Billy, always standing far away and staring at him. Then the bus came. Billy, confused, got on the bus along with the rest of the children.

""Hey, Mister Bus Driver!"" one of the chldren shouted. ""Billy doesn't know what the Purple Wombat is!""

The bus driver turned around abruptly. ""You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" he said in disbelief. He ordered Billy to sit in the very back of the bus, all by himself.

Eventually, they got to school, and Billy got off the bus and went to class. Class proceeded normally; the students did the pledge of allegiance and worked on their multiplication tables for a while. Then the teacher led them into a unit on geography. Billy was not really paying attention, but he heard the teacher mention something about the Purple Wombat.

Billy's hand shot up, and, when the teacher called on him, Billy asked, ""Teacher, what's the Purple Wombat?""

""You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" the teacher cried in alarm, ""Get yourself to the principal's office right now, young man. No, no buts -- march!""

So Billy headed down the long, dark, frightening hallway to the principal's office. He slowly opened the large, heavy door, and timidly entered the room behind it. There, at a large, imposing desk, sat the principal. The principal was a hulking man, balding, with a thin mustache. He spoke in a deep baritone voice. He was enough to frighten little boys like Billy who had been sent to his office almost to tears.

""Well, Billy,"" he began slowly. ""What seems to be the problem?""

""Mr. Principal, I just don't know what's going on today. Everyone's been acting weird, and they're all treating me really badly. Like teacher just sent me to you and stuff.""

""Now, Billy, I'm here to help you. I'm the princi-Pal, after all. Heh heh. Can you tell me why everyone's acting so strangely?""

""It's because I don't know what some stupid Purple Wombat is.""

""What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is? That's it. I am calling your mother, young man. Consider yourself suspended.""

The principal threw Billy out of his office and told him to go home. Billy, crying, began the long walk home. When he got there, his mother was standing in the doorway waiting for him.

""Billy!"" she called, sobbing, ""I was so worried about you! What happened?""

""Mom,"" Billy cried, ""Everyone was being mean to me and I had to sit in the back of the bus all by myself and the teacher sent me to the principal's office and the principal suspended me, all because I don't know what the Purple Wombat is!""

""What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" Billy's mother shrieked. ""Go to your room this minute. Go! Just wait until your father gets home!""

So Billy marched up the stairs and into his room. He collapsed on the bed, crying. After some amount of time, he heard a car pull in and some doors shutting. His father was home. He could hear his parents talking downstairs but didn't know what they were saying. Then he heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and his door opened.

""Billy,"" his father began in that lecturing-father tone, ""Your mother says you've been acting badly lately. Would you like to tell me what you've done?""

""Dad, I haven't done anything! I just don't know what the Purple Wombat is!""

""You...don't know what the Purple Wombat is. Well, in that case, you can just stay in this room all night, mister. And forget about dinner!""

Billy's father slammed the door and stormed off. Billy collapsed on his bed, crying his eyes out. He spent the next several hours that way -- lying there, crying, wishing he would wake up.

Then, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice. It said: ""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat, Billy.""

Billy sat up with a start. He looked around the room, trying to find the source of the voice, but he could not.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Find me, Billy.""

It was coming from out the window. So Billy got up, put his shoes on, opened the window, and climbed out on to the roof.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat.""

Billy jumped down off the roof and followed the voice down the road. He got to the edge of a wood.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Follow me, Billy.""

The voice was coming from inside the wood. It was very dark and very frightening, but Billy didn't care. He had to find out what the Purple Wombat was. So, bravely, he entered the wood.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Keep going, Billy.""

Billy kept going into the wood. He could hardly see anything, and he kept falling down and walking into things and hurting himself. But he kept going, driven by a need to find this enigma that kept calling his name.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. This way, Billy.""

Eventually, Billy emerged from the wood. He was on the shore of the town lake.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. I'm out here, Billy.""

It was coming from out across the lake. Billy got one of the small rowboats from the dock, untied it, and rowed out. Since he was only a small boy, it was very difficult. But he had to find out what the Purple Wombat was.

""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Row, Billy.""

The voice was coming from across the lake. Billy doubled his effort, and the boat began to move a little faster. When he was about half way across the lake, he heard: ""Billy, I am the Purple Wombat. I'm up here, Billy.""

It was coming from directly above him. Billy stopped rowing and stood up to look for it. The boat tipped over, dumping him in the lake. Billy didn't know how to swim, so he drowned.

Moral: Don't stand up in a boat.

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as ""Somebody"". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a van and pulled out his laptop. He needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

""Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?""

""Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!""

""Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?""

He continued, ""I was driving along the highway, and I saw this young girl looking very tired and bedraggled, so I offered her a lift. She was also hungry, so I brought her home and made her a meal from the roast beef in the refrigerator which you didn't like. Her sandals were pretty worn, too, so I gave her a pair of your shoes you'd discarded simply because they were out of style. She was cold, so I gave her the sweater I bought you for your birthday - the one you never wore because the colors didn't suit you. Her pants were torn as well, so I gave her a pair of yours that were perfectly good, but much too small for you now.""

The wife seemed to have no problem with any of this, but still needed one question answered. ""That's all fine and good,"" she said, ""but why did I find you both in our bed with no clothes on?""
