God replies

""Mark Hamill originally had some conflicting thoughts when he first read The Last Jedi script, but by the time he had finished the movie came around and realized that Rian Johnson's vision for Luke's character was much better than any idea he himself had and he is now very pleased with how the character developed. Disney never forced him to say anything. He was never even pressured or talked to. Mark's biggest disappointment was that fans took his words out of context to push a narrative of hate for a movie he worked hard to make and is very proud of.""

He's filled up most of his exhibits, but he's still looking for a final touch to the Q room. He puts up an online ad campaign and waits to hear back, delaying the opening until he can find a good Q. After about a month, he's about to give up and close down the museum for good, when he receives a letter.

""Dear sir, 

I've discovered your advertisements and learned about your museum. I'm ecstatic to discover a fellow giant alphabet enthusiast! I, too, quested for a good Q. Fortunately, I have been successful enough to come to have 2 Qs: one is a large, mahogany carving, which I'm willing to part with for $1,500. The other is a marble statue dating back 150 years, which I will sell you for $10,000.
I eagerly await your response,

Rodney Joseph King.""

The man wrote Mr. King back, and they arranged for the delivery of the wooden Q to the museum. Once the delivery arrived, however, it contained a metal post in the shape of an E. Confused, he wrote to King, explaining that he had received the wrong item. The letter he got back read:

""My apologies. I am having the Q carving sent at once. As a token of good will, you may keep the E for no extra charge.

Rod J. King""

The very next day, another delivery arrived. Relieved, the man went to unload his new Q so he could finally open his museum. However, he was shocked to find a wooden post in the shape of an E had been sent instead. Suspicious, he wrote another letter to King, demanding either the Q or his money back. Soon, a letter arrived in the mail:

""Again, my deepest apologies. Once again, you may keep the E. I would send you the Q carving, but it's recently been stolen from me. I have enclosed a check for $1,500, your payment for the Q. I am also willing to sell you the marble Q statue at a discounted price for your troubles - only $7,500. 

R. J. King""

Despite his issues, this was the man's only potential supplier of a Q so far, so he decided to order the Q statue. Sure enough, the delivery came soon. The man went to inspect it, and upon seeing the contents, he yelled out, 

""Dammit! It's another E-post from R. Joe K's!"" ","A rich, eccentric man owns a museum of giant, alphabet-shaped objects.",23

His friend “Don’t be so desi. There’s a computer at the
drug store that can diagnose anything quicker andcheaper than a doctor.

Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer
will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do
about it. It only costs $10.00.

Jack figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar
with a urine sample and went to the drug store.

Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and
deposited the $10.00.

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing 

After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read- You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. It will be better in two weeks.

That evening, while thinking how amazing this new
technology was and how it would change medical
science forever,Jack began to wonder if it could be fooled.

He decided to give it a try.

He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from
his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter.
To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, located the computer,
poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00.? 

The machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights,
and printed out the following analysis.......

*1.*Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.?

*2.*Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal
shampoo.?

*3.*Your daughter is getting’ screwed by three guys at
the same time and has urinary infection. Put her on
Antibiotic and keep a track of her outings.

*4.* Your wife is pregnant . . . twins. They aren’t yours.
Get a lawyer.

*5.* And Bastard, If you don’t stop masturbating, your
elbow will never get better!

Now this costume maker might be famous, but no one but himself and a few people know his real name. His identity was shrouded in mystery. The name he goes by is Mr. D.D., which are his initials. The journalist was determined to know Mr. D.D.'s true name.

When the date of the appointment came, the journalist went to Mr. D.D.'s mansion and was greeted by Mr. D.D. himself. Mr. D.D. was an intimidating man, rugged-looking and very burly, but had refined taste in clothing.

""Good afternoon, sir. My name is Sheena, and I am very pleased to meet you,"" said the journalist.

""Good afternoon as well, Sheena. I am Mr. D.D., but you already know that. Come in! I will show you all my costumes!"" replied Mr. D.D.

Sheena was delighted. She followed Mr. D.D. in his costume exhibit, while taking notes about their conversation and admiring all his costumes. She tried her hardest to find any clues about Mr. D.D.'s name, but to no avail.

Finally, Mr. D.D. took Sheena to the last costume in the exhibit. It was on a golden pedestal, worn by a golden mannequin. It was a nun costume.

""This is the very first costume that I made. I made it during hard times. This costume is the only costume that I wore, and it is very dear to me. It made me popular all over the world."" Mr. D.D. said.

Since this was her last chance, Sheena finally found the courage to ask Mr. D.D. his real name. 

""Mr. D.D., this can be our little secret. What is your real name?"" Sheena asked.

Mr. D.D. looked at her straight in the eye. He decided that Sheena seemed trustworthy enough.

The librarian is still confused, but gives the chicken three random books, which it takes under its wing and goes on its way.

The next day, the librarian sees the chicken come back to the library again, returning all three books. Before she has a chance to ask anything the chicken clucks:

Taken aback, the librarian gives the chicken five more books before it leaves. But the librarian is curious about what exactly is going on here, so she takes her break and follows the chicken out of the building. Eventually, she sees the chicken go into a house, so the librarian sneaks up to the window and looks inside. There, she sees a sick frog, with a cast on its leg, resting in bed.

Finally, the man hesitantly says ""Listen, honey, you know I love you, but we're desperate, here. I can only think of one way we could come up with as much cash as we need, in such a short time.""

""What is it?"" she asked. ""You're not planning on robbing a bank...""

""On crutches?! I don't think so!"" he gulped ""No... it's... uh... you're a very beautiful woman. I'm sure there'd be plenty of guys who would be willing to *pay...*""

""You want me to *prostitute myself?!*"" she exclaimed.

""No, no, honey... I promise I don't *want* you too. I just can't think of another option, can you?""

The woman sulks for a while, thinking it over, and finally agrees. ""I guess you're right. I mean, what choice do we have?""

----

Later that night, the pair pull up outside a bar in town. The woman nervously gulps, and says ""I don't know if I can do this.""

Her husband, trying to be reassuring, says ""It'll be fine. Just stand in front of the door, and when a lonely looking fellow comes out, just ask him if he's looking to have some fun. Simple as that, and I'll be right here if you need me.""

The woman, dressed in her shortest skirt, and lowest cut top, nervously gets out of the car, and leans against the wall near the bar door. Before long, a fairly tipsy young man stumbles out of the bar.

""Hey there... you want to have a good time?"" the woman asks, her voice cracking a bit.

The man gives her the once over, and says ""Hell yeah! I'm *definitely* interested. What's it gonna cost me?""

The woman gulps, and gives him the prices she and her husband had agreed upon. ""It'll be $50 for sex, or $40 for a blow job.""

""Deal!"" the young guy says. He pulls his wallet out, opens it, and frowns. ""Looks like I spent most of my money in there. What can I get for $20?""

The woman, flustered, says ""I have to check with my hus... manager. I'll be right back."" She makes her way back to the car and knocks on the window. The husband rolls it down a crack, and she explains the situation.

The husband thinks for a second, then says ""Tell him that for $20 you'll give him a hand job.""

The woman heads back over to the youth, and he agrees to the $20 hand job. The pair slip into the alley next to the bar, and the young man unzips his fly, revealing an extremely large cock. The woman's eyes widen, and she quickly runs back to the car. Her husband rolls the window down, and says ""Look, honey... I know you're nervous, but it'll be okay, I promise. We nee...""

""No, it's not that,"" the woman interrupts. ""I'm just wondering... do you think we could loan this guy 30 dollars..?""

We stayed at a small local hotel about 30 minutes from the city. The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. 

I said “I’m amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!” 

She replied “no one expects the Spanish inn physician.”",My wife and I went to Spain.,1094

""Oh, this? This is the ladder to success,"" the man replies.  

""Interesting,"" Joe mumbles. ""I was just fired from my job and caught my wife cheating on me, so what do I have to lose?""

Joe begins to climb and gets just above the lowest tier of clouds. Sitting seductively on the clouds he sees a fairly unattractive, overweight girl. 

""You can keep climbing the ladder to success or you can stay here and spend the rest of eternity with me doing whatever you want,"" she says. 

Joe thinks about it for a short time but decides that he wants to see what is at the top and continues his climb. 

Above the next set of clouds he comes across a very cute girl who is wearing only bra and short jean shorts and is in the same seductive pose as the previous girl. 

""You can keep climbing the ladder to success or you can stay here and spend the rest of eternity with me doing whatever you want,"" she says.

Joe ponders this for a moment. This girl is definitely out of his league and it sounds like this would be a great time. But the ladder is calling to him and Joe decides to continue his climb. 

Above the next set of clouds Joe comes across the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Long legs, golden skin, ample breasts and a killer smile to go with her flowing blonde hair. She is wearing nothing but a skimpy bikini that leaves very little to the imagination. 

""You can keep climbing the ladder to success or you can stay here and spend the rest of eternity with me doing whatever you want,"" she says, adding in a wink for good measure. 

Joe is drawn to her and starts to step off the ladder, but something catches his eye. He looks up and sees a hatch at the top of the ladder. Greedily, Joe thinks that if he climbs the ladder to success then he'll have fame and glory and can have any girl that he wants. So he gets back on the ladder and climbs until he pushes through the hatch. 

He is suddenly in a small cabin and looks around. All he sees is a massive, hairy beast of a man with a wry smile on his face. 

""Welcome to my cabin,"" he bellows. ""I'm Cess.""",Climbing the Ladder to Success,89

About 90 students raise their hands.

“Well, that’s a good start. Out of those of you who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you’ve ever seen a ghost?”

About 40 students raise their hands.

“That’s really good. I’m really glad you’re taking this seriously. So..has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?”

15 students raise their hands.

“That’s a great response. But has anyone here ever touched a ghost?”

Three students raise their hands.

“That’s fantastic. But let me ask you one question further....Have any of you made love to a ghost?”

One Arab student in the back raises his hand.

The professor is astonished. He takes off his glasses, takes a step back and says, “Son, all of the years I’ve been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have slept with a ghost. You’ve got to come up here and tell us about your experience.”

The student replies with a nod and a grin, and begins to make his way up to the podium. The professor says :

“Well, tell us what it’s like to have sex with a ghost”. The student replies :

He enthusiastically agreed and sped up the car. He reached the 65 MPH mark, so she took off her blouse. At 70 off came the pants. At 75 it was her bra and At 80 her panties. Now seeing her naked for the first time...and traveling faster than he ever had before...he became very excited and lost control of the car.

He veered off the road, went over an embankment and hit a tree! His girlfriend was not hurt, but he was trapped. She tried to pull him free but alas he was stuck.

""Go to the road and get help,"" he said. ""I don't have anything to cover myself with!"" she replied.

The man felt around, but could only reach one of his shoes. ""You'll have to put this between your legs to cover it up,"" he told her. So she did as he said and went up to the road for help.

Along came a truck driver. Seeing a naked, crying woman along the road, he pulled over to hear her story. ""My boyfriend! My boyfriend!"" she sobs, ""He's stuck and I can't pull him out!""

The truck driver looking down at the shoe between her legs replied, ""Ma'am, if he's in that far, I'm afraid he's a goner!""",A man and a woman were dating. NSFW,943

For the life of him, he couldn't get them within two feet of each other. Frustrated, he called up the local zoologist, and explained the situation. She hurried over, picked up the snakes and looked at them. ""You know what I would do?"" she said. ""See that tree over there? Chop it down, chop off a good sized log, split the log in two, and make two tables out of them. Put the tables and the snakes into a cage, and let them go at it.""

Well, the breeder thought that this was insane, but having no other options, he tried it. Sure enough, a few days later he had a whole slew of baby snakes. He called up the zoologist, and asked her how that was possible. She replied, ""Well, you see, those snakes were adders. And everybody knows that to get adders to multiply you need log tables.""

The audience would be different each week, so the magician figured he'd be safe to recycle his tricks. He was wrong though. The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting out the secrets in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat."" ""Look, he is hiding the flowers under the table."" ""Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything -- after all, it was the captain's parrot. One day, the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself with the parrot, adrift on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean. They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word. This went on for a day, then another, and another.

Finally, after a week, the parrot said, ""Okay, I give up. Where the heck is the boat?""",On the cruise ship. Damn parrot . . .,74

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting strange. We had made plans to
meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all
day long, so I thought he was upset that I was a bit late, but he made no 
comment about it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go
somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much. 
I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked
him if it was my fault he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that
it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it. On the way
home, I told him I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving.
I can't explain his behavior, I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love
you, too.' When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as
if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly,
and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with
silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later,
he came to bed. To my surprise, he responded to my caress, and we made
love. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were
somewhere else. He fell asleep - I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm
almost sure his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a
disaster.

I think that will help me the most.”

Shocked, but still wanting to help, her therapist agrees. They have sex and Oprah is thrilled with how it went. Afterwards, she asks the therapist to do it again. He replies by saying “Okay, we can do it again. But I’m going to take a 20 minute nap and while I sleep, I need you to hold my balls with your left hand and and my wiener with your right hand” 

This request really confuses Oprah, but she complies and wakes him up after 20 minutes. They do it again and Oprah is even more happy than the last time.

 “Cured?” the man asked, “How did that happen?”

 “My friend Johanna recommended that I go see a hypnotist. The hypnotist told me to stand in front of a mirror and repeat ‘I don’t have a headache, I don’t have a headache, I don’t have a headache.’”

The woman continued with a broad smile, “I was skeptical at first, but I tried it out, and it worked! No more headache!”

 “That’s amazing!” the man replied.

 The woman squirmed a bit, and then hesitantly said, “Honey, for the last few years, you haven’t exactly been a Tarzan in bed. How about you go to the hypnotist too, maybe he can help you out?”

The man thought about it for a while, and then decided that it couldn’t hurt to try.

 After his visit to the hypnotist, the man returned home with new confidence. He lifted his wife up, carried her to the bedroom, undressed her and said:
“Don’t move, I’ll be right back.”

The man walked briskly to the bathroom. After a short while, he came back to bed and made passionate love to her like never before.

 The wife said breathlessly, “Oh my, now that’s what I’m talking about.”

After they were done, the man once again said, “Don’t move, I’ll be right back.”

He went to the bathroom, and after a short while he came back and they made love even more passionately than before.

“Oh my, that was wonderful” the woman said.

 The secret is revealed

 The man got up again, and said, “Don’t move, I’ll be right back.” And for a third time, he went to the bathroom.

 This time, the woman couldn’t resist the temptation. She sneaked out of the bed and followed her husband. There she saw him standing in front of the mirror, repeating:

“She’s not my wife, she’s not my wife, she’s not my wife.”

""Dad, we are learning about our system in school, but I don't think I really got it, can you explain it to me?"" 
The father answers: 
""Sure, imagine it like this: I bring home the money, so I'm the capital. Your mom spends the money, so she is the government. Granpa, is the unions, because he checks if everything is going the right way. Anna, the girl that lives with us and cleans the house is the working class. And we are all doing it for you. You are the citizens. And your baby brother is the future."" 
The son is a bit sceptical and says:
""I think I will have to sleep a night over it.""

In the middle of the night the boy is woken up by the crying of his little brother who has shit his diapers, so he goes to the parents room. There he only finds his mother and she sleeps so tight that he can't wake her up.
So he goes to Anna's room where the father is having sex with the girl and the grandfather is watching through the window. 
He decides to go back to sleep. 

The next morning at the breakfast table the father asks the son:
""Have you understood what I told you?""
""I think so"" the son said ""The capital screws the working class, the unions are watching, the government sleeps, the citizens are ignored and the future is lying in shit!""

One day he went shopping. The shop owner was a real expert with sizes: could tell anyones clothes' size. The man asked to pack a 42 size shirt but the owner insisted on 38 and to his surprise it fit him exactly. He then went to buy pants on which owner fixed the size that fit him perfectly. On he went to the underwear section and asked the owner to pack him one of 28 size but the owner insisted on 34. The guy exclaimed that he had been wearing size 28 since forever. The owner argued that 34 was what he wanted. The man now frustrated, argued that he had been wearing a 28 all this time and that he was not going to change it over some random person's intuition. The owner, who was tired of explaining, finally said ""But if you were to wear a size 28 underpants long enough, your balls would get squeezed to death and cause you an unbearable headache!""",[Long] Once there was a guy who was suffering from a severe headache.,13
