She sees some sheep and a herder in a field yonder and decides to crawl up a small hill and count the sheep. Being very careful not to be seen. After counting 3 times she heads down the hill and approaches the herder.

""Herder"", she says. ""If i guess how many sheep you have, can I have one?"". The herder is a bit taken aback. He is not used to being approached in the middle of nowhere by a lovely lady. ""Yes, if you guess how many sheep are in my flock. You can have one"".

The girl says ""261"". The herder is shocked! ""Wow, that is correct! Pick any one you like"". 

The girl picks one up and walks back to her car. Very pleased with herself. But just as she is about to close the trunk, the herder asks... ""If i guess you real hair color... Can I have my dog back?""

One afternoon during work, Tim decided that he wanted to go driving on the dunes in egypt. So that weekend, he booked tickets to Cairo and took a few extra days off work. When he arrived in Cairo he took a bus to a smaller village with less people and laxer laws and rented a car to drive on the dunes. He went out the first time at night around 11:30 because his flight came in late. 

Tim had a marvelous time on the dunes: driving up and down them, going far too fast, and of course, drifting. He was at it all night and was having fun but the sky was getting brighter and he decided it was time to head home. As he started off towards the village the car suddenly sputtered and died and try as he might, Tim could not start it up again. Tim kept trying to start the car, he had extra gas so it wasn't that, what could it be? 

Eventually Tim figured out the battery had died. This worried Tim slightly but he remembered the village was to the east so he figured he could walk. The car compass said the nose was pointing east so he took his water bottle from the car and started walking off in that direction. What Tim didn't know was that the compass wasn't accurate because the car had died so he ended up walking west instead of east. He walked for a few hours at which point he climbed to the top of a large dune to see if he could see the village. From the summit he looked and could only see the car several miles back where he came from and then nothing but desert for miles and miles around.

Tim decided it would be best to head back to the car and around mid day he made it back. He then decided it would be best to follow the car tracks. He followed and followed them along but ended up back at the car. Confused and frustrated, he thought how that could happen. He concluded that because he was doing donuts, he ended up following the wrong trail. He set out again determined to find the right one; an hour later he was back at the car. He tried one last time but the wind was covering the tire tracks with sand making traveling not possible and he was forced to return to the vehicle. Tim by this point was desperate. He decided his only option was to just pick a direction and hope for the best. He collected what little remained of his water and a bottle of wiper fluid he had in his car in case he needed fluids and picked a direction and started walking.

By the time Tim left the car it was pushing 6 o'clock. He walked and walked for several hours and ended up at the foot of a large sand dune. Tim decided that his best chance of survival was to climb the dune so he set out. About 45 feet up he was feeling the burn and pretty soon it became too steep to climb. Tim got on his hands and knees determined to climb the dune. About half way up he chugged the last of his water and continued to forge on. About 3/4ths of the way up he felt like he was dying of dehydration and decided that having some fluids in him was better than none and he could be cured of the poison back in the town, so Tim drank the wiper fluid. The fluids in him again had him feeling rejuvenated and he pushed to the top of the dune.

When he reached the top his head was spinning from the wiper fluid but he had made it! He crested the peak and looked out into the falling sun expecting to see the village. Unfortunately all he saw around him was desert. Disheartened he looked to going back down the dune when he noticed something, a smallish wooden and straw structure half buried in the sand. He started crawling down the dune toward the structure, now fully feeling the effects of the poison. He crawled into an opening in the structure and by this time he was barely conscious. Inside the structure was a golden colored lever. This confused Tim, and when he stood up to try and push it, his head started spinning something bad and he collapsed into unconsciousness. 

Tim woke up to light coming through the cracks in the building and felt rejuvenated. He felt healthy. ""How is this possible?"" Tim thought to himself, ""am I dead?"" Tim started to sit up, those questions floating through his head when all of a sudden he was face to face with a snake. And much to Tim's astonishment, the snake began to speak. ""Hello I am nate the snake"" The snake said. Tim was confused and scared but he worked up the nerve to sputter out a few ""whats"" and ""hows."" The snake interrupted Tim's unintelligible babbling to say ""Travelers usually don't find this place, and the ones that do get 2 wishes. I saw that you were poisoned, dehydrated, and dying so I granted a wish on your behalf allowing you to survive and stay healthy without a need for food and water."" This made about as much sense as any explanation that Tim thought of so he accepted it. The next question that came to Tim's mind concerned the lever. Nate the Snake began to explain: 
""The lever is a doomsday lever, in fact, this area used to be what you know as the garden of eden. This lever was supposed to destroy the world and all its inhabitants if the animals became corrupt or evil, since then humanity has spread all across the planet and we can't have the world ending now can we?"" 

Tim didn't quite buy it but the snake continued his story: ""I am descendant of a generation of serpents supposed to guard this lever and make sure no travelers, such as yourself, wander across this lever and push it killing everybody."" 
By this point Tim was so confident he was hallucinating that he just went along with it. The snake asked if Tim had any questions: 
""Ya so do you know where the village is?"" Tim asked. Nate the Snake replied with a short ""no"" and continued to talk on about how Tim is the first person he'd seen in many many years, as it became more apparent that Tim didn't really care, Nate the Snake pointed out that Tim still had one wish. ""Oh right!"" Tim exclaimed and proceeded to ask Nate for an internal compass so that Tim would always know where he wanted to go. Suddenly, Tim knew the way to the village, it was about a days walk southeast of where the structure was. With that in mind, Tim thanked Nate and promised to visit again (still thinking he's hallucinating but at least he has a direction to go now) and he set out southeast to where he hoped the town was.

Tim stumbled into town later in the day convinced that he was just lucky and that the Nate the Snake encounter was a fever dream on account of the poison. He checked into a hospital and was given drugs to flush out the toxins but he was fine. He decided to cut his trip short on account of his odd adventure in the desert and he took a bus back to Cairo the next day then flew home. Tim continued his life where he left off, and he told all his friends about his ordeal in the desert, and he went on with his normal life for about 5 years.

Then one day Tim was going to go out to eat with is friends and something occurred to him: he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over a week, he'd just been too busy and didn't think of it. This puzzled Tim as he racked his brain to figure out why then suddenly the whole Nate the Snake encounter came flooding back to him. If he didn't need to eat or drink, that means the whole encounter much had actually happened! Tim became terrified then excited as he considered the possibilities of it then he remembered the promise he made to Nate to come back and visit him. He hastily bought a ticket to Cairo for the weekend and took a couple days off work. The flight was uneventful and he ended up in Cairo where he took a bus to the small village.

Tim didn't have the money to rent a car this time but since he didn't need to eat or drink he figured  he could just walk to Nate's domain. With his internal map pointing the way, Tim set off into the desert to the Northwest and walked for the rest of the afternoon and well into the night. By the time the sun was rising behind him, Tim walked over the final dune and saw the small wood and grass structure that housed the lever. When Tim was approaching the structure, Nate the Snake slithered out in front of him. ""Tim!"" Nate the Snake exclaimed, ""I thought you'd forgot about me"" 
Tim felt blood rushing into his cheeks as he felt ashamed about forgetting, ""Im sorry Nate, Ive just been so busy living my life and honestly, i chocked our whole meeting up to hallucinations due to the poison""
""Thats understandable"" nate said ""Thank you for coming back though it really means a lot to me, anyway I have someone to introduce you to.""
As if on cue, a smaller snake slithered out.
""Tim"" Nate continued, ""This is my son Joe""
""Oh hi there"" Tim said
""Now tim,"" Nate said, ""I actually have a huge favor to ask you, my son, Joe, will take over my job when I die and be bound to guard the lever forever. I want you to take Joe with you and show him the world, I know this is a lot to ask but please, I want him to see the world before he's bound to the lever forever""

Tim was hesitant but he figured that Nate had saved his life, so he owed him that favor. So after the meeting, Tim and Joe trekked back across the desert to the village and back to Cairo. Nate quit his job and they spent the remainder of his money traveling the world. Tim and Joe travelled Asia first, then the americas and finally they went to europe. It was around the 5th month of the traveling and Tim and Joe ended up in a bar in Norway. Over some beers they were discussing their plans next and Joe spoke up saying that they had been gone for a while and that it might be time to go back.  Tim agreed that it was time and they flew out to Cairo a few days later.

They landed in Cairo and took the bus to the village and started walking the day and a half journey to Nate and Joe's home. After about 6 hours of walking, Tim and Joe came across a car half buried in the sand. Tim brushed off the sand and unburied it from the sand before climbing inside. After checking out the car and briefly looking at the engine, Tim concluded that it was in working order. Tim and Joe searched a little bit for a person to whom the car belonged but found nobody around, so they hot-wired the car and started driving to shave off many hours from their journey. 

After a few hours of driving they were nearing the lever and started the last downhill section toward the lever. The car started picking up speed so Tim applied the break, and nothing happened. Tim started panicking and slamming the break but the car didn't slow down at all. ""Whats wrong?"" Joe asked with a tone of fear in his voice.
""The car's breaks or jammed it isn't working""
Tim and Joe both pushed on the breaks as hard as they could but nothing happened. They turned off the engine in desperation but the car kept sliding toward the structure, suddenly, Nate came out of the structure to the left facing away from the car but he couldn't hear because the engine was off. There was a flat area behind the structure so Tim figured if he just turned right he could roll to a stop.

Tim turned the wheel right but the car didn't shift at all because the tires were stuck in a groove. Tim kept trying to turn it but nothing was happening, he briefly by accident shifted the wheel left and the car moved. The car was going quickly toward the lever building and they had to make a move. Tim kept yelling ""What do I do?"" to Joe, he could either hit the building or move left and hit Nate because the car wouldn’t go right. Joe was rather quiet and then he looked Tim with tears in his and rested his tail upon the wheel and started pushing it to the left. Tim looked confused and scared as joe maneuvered the car so that it would hit Nate. Tim looked at Joe and asked, ""Why?"" and Joe looked back, crying now, and said:

Better Nate than lever.","Nate the Snake joke Warning, unhealthily long",216

The man is dressed in an expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has a limo parked outside. Furthermore, the man has an orange for a head.
The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint, despite having an orange for a head.
The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.
""Excuse me,"" says the bartender, ""I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?""
So the man told his story.
""A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie.

""For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.
""For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.

post,50bdjd,2qh72,jokes,false,1472567162,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/50bdjd/nate_the_snake/,self.jokes,,"So, there's a man crawling through the desert.

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.
He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.
After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.
He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.
Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.
Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.
He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.
He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.""
The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson.

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.""

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?""
""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?""

""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.

""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.""

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

""That takes two requests, Jack.""

""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.
""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?
Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?""

""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""

""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"" answered Nate.

""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up. ""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk.""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack.""

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least.""

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?"" asked Jack.
""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.""
""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.
Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""
Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?""
""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't think to ask back when I started here.""
""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know.""

""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"" protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to try your best, Jack.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?""
""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.""
""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?""
""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""
""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, ""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?""

""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward. Like he had a lot to think about.""

""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.
Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now, Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

The lawyer figures he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepts.

Well, the lawyer is puzzled. He takes several hours, looking up everything he can on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gives up and pays the blonde $50  
The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insists, “What is the answer to your question?”

A nugget is basically a person with no arms and legs, they used to throw them into the crow d and some hardcore punk rock concerts i went to. Anyway, i was curious so i went and sat down next to her and started chatting.
We really connected, like me and her just kept chatting about everything and had these amazing deep conversations. I ended up spending 2 hours with her before my buddies made me come and surf with them.
The next day i came back to the same beach and there she was, just lying there on her towel. Of course i came and sat down and once again we just hit it off and i got lost in conversation, she was really interesting. Towards the end we started talking about sexual stuff and then she said to me ""You know, i have never really been kissed before"" and since i was on holiday i thought fuck it and kissed her and then went for a surf. On the third day i came back she was still there so i couldn't help but start chatting. It was really amazing like i have never felt such a connection with someone. Once again the conversation steered to sexual things and then she said to me ""You know, i have never really been fucked before."" I was kinda shocked but not all that weirded out and i just thought fuck it, so i gently took her into my arms and carried her afloat the water.
I threw her in and told her ""Now your fucked""",The nugget story,5

Knocking on the door, he is greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the young man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. 

During dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought.""If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. 

As he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post.""",Chinese torture,184

""Is something wrong? You haven't touched your soup,"" the waiter asked concernedly.

The man looked up. ""Son, I been searching for mythical creatures my whole life. Dragons, Bigfoot, Nessie, Yetis, whatnot. And in this soup, I finally found one. God bless you.""

The waiter looked confused. ""I'm sorry? I don't think there's any creatures in our soup.""

""Look here, boy."" The man gestured at a carrot slice with his spoon. ""That carrot is President Obama.""

""Um...excuse me?""

The man ignored the waiter and pointed at a piece of chicken. ""That chicken right there is President Biden.""

The waiter opened his mouth and closes it again.

The man gestured at several peas with his spoon. ""See here? These peas are President Obama's yes men."" 

He stopped talking. An awkward silence ensued. Finally, the skeptical-but-curious waiter broke the silence. Pointing at the last remaining soup ingredient, broccoli, the waiter asked ""Um, there's still the broccoli, What are those supposed to be?""

The man grinned, revealing rows of yellow teeth. ""Those are the mythical creatures I was talking about. Those broccoli are Obama-in-a-bowl's no-men.""

He's frustrated, getting in night after night, after so long at this shitty job. This frustration manifests itself into a daily ritual--he takes off one shoe and throws it onto the floor: ""Damn my life!"" 
He takes the other shoe off and throws it onto the floor, too. ""Damn my life!"" 

This happens every night. SLAM. ""Damn my life!"" SLAM. ""Damn my life!"" 

One night around 4 am, after getting home and after throwing off his shoes in fury, he hears a knock at his door. He opens the door and is surprised to see his downstairs neighbor. 
""Hey man,"" says the neighbor. ""I know you're angry and all, but I just got a new job I've got to be up early for and you slamming your shoes down makes it hard to sleep. Can you be quieter?""

The man apologizes and promises to be quieter for his neighbor. 

The next night, the man comes home, and, remembering his neighbor, sets down his shoes quietly. This new practice goes on for a few days, but eventually, the stress of the job begins to get to him again, until one night, he comes home, frustrated as ever. He takes off one shoe and slams it onto the ground: 
""DAMN MY LIFE!"" 
Then, suddenly embarrassed, he remembers his neighbor. He takes his other shoe and sets it down quietly next to the first one. After a few minutes, there's a knock at the door. The man opens the door to see his neighbor again, who says, ""Can you just slam the other shoe so that I can go to sleep?!""

After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. 

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" 

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. 

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""* 

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""*Video Games*."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" 

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" 

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. 

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",The Girlfriend Joke,18321

2 hours later, the blondes have more than doubled again! Now there are at least 30 some odd blondes at this gathering all whooping and hollering ""34 Days! 34 Days!!"" Finally the bartenders curiosity has gotten the better of him. When the next blonde comes up and orders a round of shots he asks ""Ma'am, I've watched your group grow almost tenfold.

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found out that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.

It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.

Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.
On this, the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.

""Oh, very badly!"" said she. ""I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard so that I am completely braced.""

 Now the prince knew that she was a real princess because only those could feel the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.

When the husband arrived the doctor began to explain what happened. The doctor told him that his suggestion may be a little unorthodox, but he believed that he knew a way to wake the wife from her coma. The husband was instructed to have oral sex with his wife in an attempt to wake her. 

Believing that he had nothing to lose the husband entered the room. After five minutes the nurse and doctor heard a flat line coming from the patients room. They rushed inside to find the husband on the floor crying.

Once he left, the younger boy went in the booth and started listening to confession. First a man came in and admitted to having impure thoughts. The boy told him to say 5 Hail Mary's. The next man came in and admitted to stealing his neighbor's newspaper, the boy told him to say 10 Hail Mary's. Then a woman came in and admitted to cheating on her husband, by giving another man a blowjob. Sensing that this was a pretty serious offense, the altar boy wasn't quite sure how to handle it.

The butcher takes the 100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.

The pig farmer takes the 100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.

The guy at the Farmers’ Co-op takes the 100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the pub.

The publican slips the money along to the local lady of the night drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him “services” on credit.

The lady then rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the 100 note.

The hotel proprietor then places the 100 note back on the counter so the traveller will not suspect anything. At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs, picks up the 100 note, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town.

The money promptly arrives. The Arkie and his girlfriend are able to buy enough dank to last the whole semester. But our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his Father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. Even though he was always pretty much able to lie his way out of trouble, the Arkie asked his girlfriend to help him think of a really good lie to tell his Dad.

So she has him shoot the dog.

When he arrives home at the end of the year, his Father is all excited.

""Dad,"" the boy says, ""I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Ole' Blue was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading the Wall Street Journal, like he usually does"".

Every night, the same guys would turn up, have a few pints of beer, share a conversation and the occasional game of darts or dominoes. At 8pm every night, Ted would receive a visit from one of his other regulars - Champ, a stray dog who always came for a bowl of water and a few bags of pork scratchings. The regulars all loved Champ, and he was treated like the pub's mascot. 

One night just before 8pm, there was a screech of brakes outside the pub, shortly followed by a man running into the pub in a state of distress. 

""This dog, it just ran out in front of my car...I think I've killed it!""

Ted immediately feared the worst, and sure enough when he went outside, it was the heavily mangled remains of Champ in the middle of the road. Only Champ's tail remained intact. 

Ted and the other regulars were in shock, but soon decided that they should have some kind of tribute to such a well-loved regular of the pub. 

""Why don't we get his tail stuffed, and hang it above the bar?"" suggested one of the regulars. This was thought to be a great idea, and shortly after a taxidermist was called and Champ's tail was stuffed.

On New Year's Eve that year, Ted was having a quiet drink after having closed the bar at the end of a successful evening. All of a sudden, he heard some scratching noises coming from the front door. ""That sounds like Champ!"" thought Ted, but one glance at the tail above the bar told him it couldn't be. He looked into his drink, shook his head and carried on drinking. 

10 minutes later, he heard the same scratching noises. This time, he couldn't shake off his curiosity and made his way to the front door. When he opened the door, he recoiled with a huge fright; there in front of him was the ghost of Champ on the door step, looking up at him. 

+I'd like my tail back, please+ came this voice inside his head.

""I...I...I can't d-d-d-do that!"" stuttered Ted. 

+I'd like my tail back, please+ repeated the ghostly form of Champ. 

""I can't do that"" replied Ted, having overcome his original shock. 

+I have come seeking the return of my tail. I cannot transition through to the afterlife in such an incomplete state. Why can I not have my tail back?+ insisted Champ. 

Ted glanced at the clock. It was now 3:30am.

They wandered around and after a few days, they found a large campsite. Upon entering, they realized that it was inhabited by cannibals, and tried to leave but were captured. They were brought before the cannibal king, and the king stated that they would survive and be able to leave if they could pass a test. The first part of the test was to go into the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.

The first man returned to the camp and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then told him the second part of the test, which was to shove the fruit up his ass, and if he made any expression, either verbal or physical, he would be eaten. The man tried, but winced before he could get one apple in, so he was killed.

The second man arrived back at the campsite and showed the king ten blueberries. ""What do you want me to do next?"" he asked. The king replied by telling him that he had to shove the berries inside him, and if he made any expression, he would be eaten. ""This'll be easy, they're just small berries, they can fit."" The man fit eight berries into his ass when he burst out laughing. Because he broke the rules of the king's test, he was eaten as well.

The first man and the second man met in heaven, and started talking about the king's test. The first one asked, ""Why did you laugh? You almost made it; you could've been able to leave.""

Knocking on the door, he is greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the young man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. 

During dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought.""If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. 

As he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post.""",Chinese Torture,49

The Angel asked Dolly if there was some particular reason why she should go to Heaven. Dolly took off her top and said, ""Look at these, they're the most perfect breasts God ever created and I'm sure it will please God to be able to see them every day, for eternity.""
The Angel thanked Dolly, and asked Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the same question.
The Queen walked over to a toilet, pulled the lever and flushes it without saying a word.
The Angel immediately said, ""OK, your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.""
Dolly was outraged and asked, ""What was that all about? I showed you two of God's own perfect creations and you turned me down. She simply flushed a commode and she got admitted to Heaven! Would you explain that to me?

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

He's having a great time at the festival, and he sees a strikingly attractive woman across the way. 

He heads over to her and introduced herself. They start talking, and they hit it off straight away. She is a Kurdish woman, visiting Chicago with her family for the weekend while she is on holiday. He meets all of her extended family, and they all click great! One thing leads to another, and they spend the night together. 

The next day, they return to the concerts and go to see some classic rock. But things go south while they're at the concert; lead singers from two prominent bands also meet his new Kurdish girlfriend, and there's a three-way fight between Mario and the singers. The singers bring the rest of their bands to back them up, and poor Mario gets the ever loving crap kicked out of him. 

He wakes up three days later in the hospital and asks, ""Doctor, what happened?""

The doctor tells him, ""it seems you *really* upset Tommy Shaw and Mick Jagger! You're very lucky your girlfriend's family got to you in time! They kept you stable, then rushed you to the hospital! Your collarbone is shattered, your left leg was snapped just above the ankle, and you have a compound fracture in your humerus. Those bands really did a number on you!""

He goes up to the vendor, who asks:

""What will you having, sir?""

 To which the rabbit replies,

""Ah will be havin' one of your finest cheese an' onion toasties, if y'all could spare it."".

 Being a good host, the vendor complies with the request, and doesn't question the fact that a talking rabbit is on his property. 

""Thank you, mah fine sir."", says the rabbit, and leaves the sandwich bar, eating his toastie as he goes. 

 The next day, the rabbit returns, this time asking for:

 ""The best bean an' bacon toastie y'all can spare."". Of course, the vendor gives him what he asks for, and, like the day before, he goes on his way, munching away as he goes.

 The rabbit soon becomes a regular, but oddly only ever asks for one of those two toasties. He quickly strikes up a friendship with the vendor, who eventually starts seeing the rabbit almost as a human.

 After a few months of daily toastie-buying, the rabbit predictably comes in and asks again for ""one of those fahn-tahstic cheese an' onion toasties"". The vendor rushes to comply.

 Only, today he has a problem. It's the end of the week - and it's been a busy one, at that. There's no more onions for the rabbit's cheese and onion toastie, nor is there any bacon for his beloved bacon and bean. 

The vendor knows he has to give the rabbit something, so he quickly knocks up a cheese and bean toastie - one of the sandwich bar's best-selling products. As usual, the rabbit thanks the vendor and leaves, happy as can be.

 The rabbit doesn't turn up the next day. Nor does he turn up the day after. Soon, the vendor becomes worried, but just assumes that the rabbit moved away, or lost his cravings for toasties.

 Finally, a week after the rabbit disappeared, the vendor sees the rabbit's pale ghost float through the door and up to the bar.

 ""Y-you're dead!"", exclaims the vendor, shocked. ""W-what the hell happened?""

 ""Ah think it was your fault, mah friend"", explains the rabbit,

They wanted to prove to the world that they were just as smart as anyone else. In order to do this, they decided to hold a huge convention and televise it in order to prove their intelligence. As part of the convention they had Steve Harvey ask some trivia questions. The first blonde got up on stage, and the category of math came up. 
Steve Harvey asked the first blonde ""What is 28 divided by 4?""
She thought long and hard before replying ""8.""
All of the blondes were upset and began shouting ""Give her another try, give her another try!""
Steve decided to give her another try because division is pretty tricky. He asked ""What is 6 times 7?""
The blonde, after much consideration, answered ""48.""
All of the blondes shouted ""Give her another try, give her another try!""
Well, multiplication isn't the easiest type of math, so Steve decided he might as well let her go again. This time he asked ""What is 9 minus 5?"" 
The blonde replied ""2.""
All of the blondes were in an uproar now. They wanted desperately to be able to prove themselves to the world. ""Give her another try, give her another try!"" they shouted.
Steve decided to give the blonde a question that she could not possibly mess up. ""What is 2 plus 2?"" he asked.
""4,"" she replied.
At this, all of the blondes began crying and rose to their feet.

In the clearing there’s a natural pond so he sits by the water, just enjoying the view and the peace, his dog lying by his side. He hears a noise and turns round to see another dog, a Golden Retriever, coming through the trees, followed by the most beautiful blonde woman he’s ever seen.  
The women smiles and sits next to him, seemingly also enjoying the view and the peace. After a while she points at their two dogs lapping at the water and she smiles and says “They’ve got the right idea”. She takes a couple of cans of beer from her backpack and passes one to him. They sit there in silence for a bit longer, sipping their cold beers.  
Then the woman points at their two dogs, now swimming in the pond, and she smiles and says “They’ve got the right idea”. She strips down to her underwear and slips into the water. The man quickly strips to his underpants and dives into the water, which is cold and refreshing.  
After a few minutes of splashing and swimming, the woman again points to their two dogs, now on the grassy bank by the water, fucking vigorously, and she says “They’ve got the right idea”. She languidly climbs out of the water, slips out of her underwear and lays on the grass, waiting.  
He can’t contain his excitement, so he too climbs from the water, removes his underpants and lays next to the woman, turns to her and says “Are you sure your dog won’t mind?”",Walking the dog,8
