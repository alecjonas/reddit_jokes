In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock.

The brunette balances their checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale. Upon leaving, she tells her sister, ""When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.""

The brunette arrives at the man’s ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less.

After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news.

She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.""

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, ""It’s just 99 cents a word.""

Well, with only $1 left after paying for the bull, the brunette realizes that she’ll only be able to send her sister one word.

After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, “I want you to send her the word, 'comfortable.'”

The telegraph operator shakes his head. ""How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pick-up truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word, 'comfortable'?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.
The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.
The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""
The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

He went back to his own bar and started to order all kinds of sodas.
The problem was, that he did not know what to do with all the beer that he had bought earlier. He did not have any room to put it in. The only place he could think about was the roof. So he took all the beer and placed it on the flat roof.
Steve reopened the bar and in a mere second the bar was full with people ordering all kinds of sodas.
Then one day a foreign man came into the bar, he looked angry as hell and screamed ""Where can a man find himself some beer in this goddamned town!?""

Needless to say, the boy was frightened and took another way to school. He was late. The teacher asks why, and he explains:

""Some weird guy shouted 'Purple passion!' on my way here, so I had to take the long way to avoid him.""

The teacher responds, ""Go to the principal's office. Now.""

He goes and the principal asks ""Why are you here?""

He answers ""Some weirdo screamed 'purple passion' at me, so I was late, and then when I explained to the teacher, she sent me here.""

""Wait in the lobby. We are sending you home.""

His mom takes him and asks him, ""Why were you sent home?""

""Some guy jumped out of a bush and screamed purple passion at me, The teacher sent me to the principal's, and she sent me home.""

""Go to your room. Your father will talk to you about this.""

His father arrives and asks, ""What's going on?""

""Some guy jumped out of a bush and screamed purple passion at me, The teacher sent me to the principal's, she sent me home, and Mom wanted you to talk about this.""

""Get out. You're disowned.""

The boy walks along the sidewalk, confused and depressed, when a police officer drove next to him:

""Hey kid! What are you doing out here? Where are your parents?""

""They disowned me.""

""That's awful! Why?""

Again, ""Some guy jumped out of a bush and screamed purple passion at me, The teacher sent me to the principal's, she sent me home, my mom had my dad talk about it, and he disowned me.""

""Come with me. It's to the slammer with you.""

The boy is put in a cell shared with no one but the strange man from earlier. The boy is enraged.

""You! You got me into this shit! What the fuck even is purple passion!?""

He simply responds:

""Kid, purple passion is an overly long joke with no punch line.""

He obeyed the ten commandments, he read the Torah frequently and he kept kosher– but, secretly, he'd always wanted to try pork.


Everybody made so much fuss about pork and bacon and ham and he always wanted to taste it, to see if it lived up to the hype.


So, one day, he said to himself ""I'm getting on in years, I've always done my best to be good, so if I do this one thing, I'm sure it won't really matter..."" and he went to a restaurant to try some pork.



Since it would be the first and last time he ever tried it, he thinks ""might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb"" and orders the fanciest pig dish on the menu. A few minutes later, the waiter comes in with a tray carrying a whole roasted suckling pig with a big red apple lodged in its mouth.


He places it on the table, the rabbi picks up his fork and is about to tuck in when he hears a voice behind him, ""Rabbi? Is that you?"", amd turns around to see one of the people from his synagogue. They both look at each other and then at the pig and then back at each other. The man says ""Rabbi? What's going on?"" and the rabbi says...

""Excuse me sir, would you happen to have the time?""


The Egyptian looked at him, reached up, and took the camel by the balls and moved them slightly to the left.


""Its ten after two."" he pronounced.


The American was amazed, he couldn't believe what he had just seen and he ran off to find his friends and tell them about the man who could tell time from a camel's balls. 

After a short time he found them and of course they didn't believe him so he insisted that they go back and he'd prove it, so they agreed and returned.


The American once again asked. ""Excuse sir, I'm sorry to bother you again, but would you have the time?""


The Egyptian looked at him and once again reached out and grabbed the camels balls and once again slightly moved them to the left and said. ""It's twenty after two.""


The group was amazed and they left to go about their business, but the original discoverer of the miracle time teller remained behind. 

""Listen my friend, I would love to know how you do that. If I give you one hundred American dollars would you show me how you do it?""


The Egyptian thought for a moment and nodded ok and pocketed the hundred dollars and then motioned to the American to kneel where he was. 

The American knelt and then the Egyptian said. ""All right grab the camels balls and gently pick them up and slightly move them to the left.""


The American followed the Egyptian's orders to the tee and then asked. ""Now what?""

I know one student said, let's put the offending cops under investigation and have them do desk work until it's over. More officers started shooting because it was a convenient life. Another said make it so police can't eat or go home after a shooting for 4+ hours to discourage this. The police then ignore crime around 2hours before lunch of the end of their shift. The criminal AI noticed and crime rose significantly.

The students agreed to undo the last rule and give police a paycut if they shoot someone no exceptions. Police now shoot people and quit after getting a paycut causing a massive shortage. Another student had a bright idea of having body cameras. Everything was fine for a few simulated days but the police AI noticed if they stand behind a car or some object the camera won't see the conflict. Police AI now stand behind cars or trees for a minute or two before shooting civilizations

Frustrated the students asked the forth year computer science student next running an unknown operating system called linux. They said they think there is a bug in the simulation because the police won't stop shooting people. The CS student had them explain what was happening in detail. He looked at them like they were idiots. He suggested they **remove** all that crap they added, **remove** everything about cops and guns. There is code that people will use guns when they're in danger (even if it's illegal) that will trigger when the person/policeman is in danger

To everyone's amazement this worked. Now police just drag people to dark alleys to beat the shit out of them or plant false evidence. Society score was drastically improved because of no fatal police shootings",[OC] Students simulate police AI and the police casually shoot civilians.,1

This leads to many confrontations between the multitudes of fauna, such as the one I am about to tell you :

So a fly is flying 3 inches above the waterline, just buzzing around lazily and chilling in general. A few feet below lies a king salmon, swimming around, thinking :

*""If that the fly will drop a few inches I can jump up and eat it!""*


Now on the riverbank, there's a bear observing what's going on, and it's thinking to itself :


*""If that fly drops a few inches and the salmon jumps up to eat it, I can catch that salmon""*


Down the road, a few hundred feet away a hunter stands ready to strike down the bear, he just needs a better shot. So the hunter is thinking :


*""If that fly drops a few inches and the fish eats the fly, and the bear eats the fish, I can shoot that there bear.""*


Now a mouse is hidden in the grass next to the hunter, not far from his packs, and the mouse is thinking :


*""If that fly gets eaten by the fish and the bear catches the fish and the hunter shoots the bear, that gives me an opportunity to grab some of his cheese.""*


Further up a hill, watching over it all there's a tabby cat, and the cat is thinking :


*""If that fly gets eaten by the fish and the bear catches the fish and the hunter shoots the bear, and the mouse takes the cheese, I can eat the mouse.""*


So the fly drops a few inches, the fish jumps up gracefully and eats the fly, the bear catches the fish in it's powerful jaws, the hunter shoots the bear, the mouse nimbly takes the cheese, but when the cat races down the hill to eat the mouse, it slips and falls into the water.

She thanks her, and the women are on their way. Mary then stops by to get some eggs and runs into the taller lady again.

Sherri also signed up her husband, Gary. They have a great time and the yoga class brings the ladies closer. They decide to take another class together, so they sign up for karate.

Their master, Larry, reluctantly signed them on and gave them white belts, telling them they have much to learn. They spend a few months and make yellow belt.

Frustrated with their slow progress, they decide to pursue another route. They decide to have a child at the same time. They both get pregnant and spend a few more months in the Karate class while they can, but there comes a point where they have to inform Larry that they must put their training on hold. Larry accepts, and states that they have grown much in the past months, and he would always be their karate master.

There is an issue with Sherri's pregnancy, and she becomes weak. Sherri and Gary hire a maid, Terry, to keep the house clean and help Sherri with whatever she needs, as Gary is very busy with work and her friend Mary is dealing with her own pregnancy.

Sherri and Mary both have their water break on the same day, and their husbands are both stuck in traffic. Mary panics, and calls Sherri, asking who can help them. Sherri informs them that they fired Terry because she was stealing, and all her other contacts are not answering. Mary gets an idea, and calls Larry.

But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. 

Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.""

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" Dave thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read 

""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" 

In a panic Dave glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""",Chinese Torture,70

The barman pours the cider and says, ""That'll be £2.49.""

So this guy is driving in the desert when his car breaks down. He gets out and began looking for help. He can't find any and passes out of heat stroke. But he survives and a snake stared him right in the eyes. 'AHHHHH!!!' He screamed. 'Hello' said the snake 'My name is Nate and I am a magical snake'. Nate bites the guy and all of a sudden, he feels better. 'I'm Jack by the way' he says.

They talk for a while until Jack said,'That pole your coiled around looks like a lever.' 'It is' Nate replies. 'What does it do?' Jack asked. 'Destroys humanity'. 'Come on' Jack chuckled, 'what does it actually do?' 'I'm not lying, it does destroy humanity. This place used to be the Garden of Eden and God placed it here incase the human race fell outta whack.' Nate replied

Jack stayed for a while longer but eventually he asks Nate where the nearest town is. Nate directed Jack to the town and he found a tow truck to tow back his broken car.

A few weeks later Jack decides to go visit Nate. As he drove over the final sand dune he realised he was heading directly towards the lever that destroys humanity. He tries to turn but there isn't enough traction. He guesses that if he veers enough, he might just be able to avoid hitting the lever. He veers left as hard as he can but soon realises that Nate is lying there. There isn't enough time to turn the other way so he runs over Nate.

As he runs over Nate, he exclaims 'BETTER NATE THEN LEVER'.

In the middle of the lake there was an island, and the 3 kingdoms had been fighting over it for years. No one seemed to be able to keep the upper hand for very long and no one had been victorious. The wars over this little island were very costly, but all 3 kingdoms wanted it because of its great beauty and resources.

Finally, the monarchs agreed to a way to settle the matter permanently. Each would send their knights and squires to the island and they would
fight it out. Whoever’s knights and squires won the day would keep the island forever.

One kingdom sent many knights and each knight had a few squires. The night before the battle, the knights polished their armor while the squires readied the weapons. When the armor was finished, the knights sat around the fire drinking.

The second kingdom sent more knights than the first and each knight had several squires. The night before the battle, the knights drank around the fire while the squires scurried about polishing armor and readying weapons.

The third kingdom only sent one knight and he had only one squire. While the squire polished armor and readied the weapons, the knight hung a single pot from the tallest branch of the tree and tied a rope with a loop at the end from another branch. Then the knight sat by the fire and drank while the squire kept working.

The fateful day came and all the squires came out to the battlefield. (The knights had stayed up too long drinking.) The battle was fierce. In the
end, only the lone squire from the third kingdom was left standing. Proving once again, the age old theorem:

The squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

The guide has this German shepherd with him. Dog's got its nose low, sniffing, and the guide explains that this dog is trained to find gorillas any time of the year, reliably.

So on the first day, the dog proves to be a valuable resource, and they find this gorilla up in the tree. Rick explains to the guide that he's here specifically to *capture* a wild gorilla in the name of science, and the guide is to cage the gorilla as soon as it falls. Rick shakes the tree, the guide steps forward with the cage, and the dog *rips the gorilla's nuts off*.

Rick is furious. He stomps over. ""You dumb bastard, we need the gorilla alive and intact. We're breeding them! Tomorrow, keep your dog under control!""

The guide claims to understand, and the following day Rick reminds him why they're here and to handle the dog. He starts shaking the tree, but the gorilla is unfazed. He climbs up into the tree to shake it. The gorilla falls from the tree, the guide tries to cage the gorilla, and the dog snaps its rope to go bite off the gorilla's nuts.

Rick walks over. ""I can't do this forever. Tomorrow is my last chance. If your dog goes near that gorilla, you're going to shoot your fucking dog, do you understand me?""

The next day, the guide is visibly worried, but they find a gorilla. This thing is *huge*. Rick starts to climb and shake the tree, but the gorilla doesn't notice and keeps eating its banana. Rick climbs a little higher and gives the branch a shake. The gorilla notices, looks at him, and snorts. Then it kicks him in the face, and Rick's falling from the tree *fast*.

The Bartender sees such a vivid depth of despair and ennui in the Horse's eyes, like the Horse has stared into the abyss and found the infinite void of nothingness so deep that the Horse could no longer believe that he himself nor anyone nor anything else existed.

To say something exists requires knowledge of self,
which requires knowledge of existence of the self, an obviously impossible leap of logic, absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.

The Bartender, in that single instant within the Horse's mind,
became the nothingness the Horse perceived, and thus was rendered speechless. If neither the Horse, nor the Bartender,
nor the bar itself can be said to exist, then why should he ask,
how could he ask, ""why the long face?""

The question can have no meaning, and that which has no meaning cannot be stated. The Bartender, dumbstruck, not by realization of mortality but by fundamental doubt that he was ever alive, gazes into the endless depth of the Horse's eyes,
and asks him, ""Sir, I beg you say, do I exist?""

The Horse replies,

""Neighhhh...""",A horse walks into a bar.,17

One day, Jimmy's mother was quite lonely, especially this day because she had been trying to find a boyfriend, but ultimately failed. As a young mother, she had needs, sexual needs. So a day later she asked the only person who truly loved her to have sex with her- Jimmy. Jimmy was confused at first, but after her mother told Jimmy what to do, Jimmy enjoyed it, and so did his mother. During intercourse, Jimmy said "" You and Daddy are so funny. You both like my little friend. "" Jimmy's mother knew he was talking about his penis, but she was confused about the fact that Jimmy never met is father, but she carried on.

Three months after Jimmy and his mother had sex, she tested positive for herpes. Jimmy's mother was shocked, and she knew that she sex with Jimmy and Jimmy only, and sure enough, Jimmy had herpes too. Jimmy's mother thought he might of contracted it from his birth father, but she knew he didn't have herpes, so the question is...

Who gave Jimmy herpes?

Good Luck, there is a correct and logical answer.

They always tried to outdo each other bragging about their congregations and sermons.
Finally the diner owner got tired of it. ""It's always the same with you three. Why don't you take on something challenging?""
""Like what?"" asked the priest.
""Doesn't the Bible say something about scripture taming a wild beast? If any of you were any good you'd save a wild beast and convert the beast to your religion.""
""What kind of beast?"" the Rabbi asked.
""Well there are bears in the woods. Why don't you convert a bear?""
After talking it over the three clerics accepted the challenge and drew straws to see who would try first.
The Priest drew the first straw and headed out into the woods. The next day the Preacher and Rabbi went to the Cathedral to check on the Priest.  The vicar had a cast on one arm and a large bandage on his head. ""What happened Father O'Malley?"" the Preacher asked.
""I went into the woods and found the great beast. I read to him from the Book of  Catechism. The bear got mad and swatted me with his great paw. But I prayed with him and next month when the Bishop is here, the bear will take his first communion.""
The next day it was the Preacher's turn. Later the Priest and Rabbi went to the Preacher's house to check on him. The Preacher's wife answered the door and let them know her husband was resting in bed. She showed them in. The Preacher had both arms in casts and was scratched and clawed all over his head and bare chest.
""What happened?"" said the Priest.
""I found the great beast above the river. I knew to bring salvation to the savage he had to be fully submersed in baptism. So I took hold of the beast and as he bit and clawed me I wrestled him down the bank and held him under the water as I baptized him in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. He rose from the watery grave in a new state of grace.""
Finally it was the Rabbi's turn. For more than a week the Priest and Preacher could not find out what had happened. Finally they found out the Rabbi was in the hospital. They rushed there to find their friend in a full body cast and were told he had been unconscious for 3 days.
""Rabbi, what happened?""

The Trids were barely making a living on the side of a hill. They knew, however, that there was a beautiful field of valuable Flurd just on the other side of the hill, and if they could get their hands on some of that Flurd, their lives would improve immeasurably.

Unfortunately, there was a large, foul-tempered Ogre who lived on the top of the hill and guarded that Flurd night and day. 

The Trids tried everything to get over the hill to the fields of Flurd. They charged up the hill in great numbers. Didn't matter; the Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted to sneak past the Ogre at night. Didn't matter; the Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted a flanking maneuver; some Trids running to the left of the Ogre and others to the right. Didn't matter; the Ogre kicked them all back down the hill.  

No matter what they tried, the damned Ogre kicked the Trids back down the hill. 

One day, as the Trids were moping around at the base of their hill, a small rabbit happened upon them. ""Why so sad, Trids?"" asked the rabbit. 

Well, the Trids told the rabbit about the beautiful Flurd on the other side of the hill, and how the terrible Ogre would kick all of the Trids down the hill no matter how hard they tried to get to the other side.

""How about I try?"" said the rabbit.

""Go ahead,"" said the Trids miserably. ""But I don't think you'll have any luck.""

So the rabbit hopped up the hill, approaching the Ogre. The Ogre ignored him. The rabbit hopped right alongside the Ogre. Still no reaction from the Ogre. The rabbit hopped right past the Ogre, and the Ogre did nothing!

So the rabbit hopped down the hill, gathered as much Flurd as he could hold in his short rabbit arms, and hopped back up the hill. He then hopped right in front of the Ogre, holding the Flurd right in front of him.

The Ogre opened one eye, sighed, and closed it again.

""Excuse me, Mr. Ogre,"" said the rabbit, ""but how is it that you let me hop right past you and take as much Flurd as I can carry, but you kick the Trids down the hill whenever they get close to you?""

And the Ogre said, ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids.""

He had a beer on tap, and right before his fathers eyes, an arm popped out of the base of his head. His father was amazed that this alcohol was a solution(as opposed to what his wife said). The father ordered another drink, the man drank it and another arm popped out! Eventually after several beers the head became an entire body. They were about to pay for the drinks when the bartender remembered that he needed to see the newly grown man's I.D. The man said that he would go get it from his car. As he was crossing the street, he was a bit groggy from the beers, and a little wobbly because he just learned to walk. He didn't see the car coming and it hit him, he died from the accident.

Raja Todermal was obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

One day Raja Todermal revealed his secret desire to his intelligent colleague, Birbal. Birbal thought about this and said that he could arrange for Raja Todermal to more than satisfy his desire. But, it would cost him 1,000 gold coins to arrange it. Right away, Raja Todermal readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Birbal made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Birbal informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Raja Todermal would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Raja Todermal to their chambers. Birbal then slipped Raja Todermal the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth. For the next four hours, Raja Todermal worked passionately on the Queens ' large, magnificent breasts. The Queens ' itching was eventually relieved, and Raja Todermal left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Raja Todermal found Birbal asking his payment of 1,000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Raja Todermal couldn't care less knowing that Birbal could never report this matter to the King, and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Birbal slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the Kings' underwear. The King immediately summoned Raja Todermal…

Houdini called him Mills. After years of watching Houdini perform Mills couldn't help but want to be a magician too. But Alas, he was a bunny. Before Houdini died he gave his bunny to a secret science lab and asked them to take care of him and if they did they would be allowed 100,000 dollars written to them in his will. The lab of course, accepts immediately as they were running out of funds and this was the perfect offer for them. After Houdini's death the lab used Mills in many experiments. One, which was meant to make him run faster, did so. Although, it also eventually made him life sized. In the middle of the night he becomes large enough to shatter his cage. He then escapes the lab and starts a new life. Many years go by. In which, Mills has had a job carrot farming and accumulated enough money to buy a home. He then bought tapes of Houdini's shows and studied them intensely and endlessly. The farmer fires Mills from his job for not showing up because Mills spent all his time studying magic. He starts out with a simple card trick to a neighbor across the street, fortunately enough, it was their card. He soon went on to greater things, like sawing people in half, which unfortunately he failed a few times. R.I.P The Smiths across the street. He decides that for his great first appearance he shall collaborate with another Magician. His name was The General.  The General and Mills began practicing their trick, pulling Mills out of his hat. They finally get on stage for their first performance. They setup in front of an audience of thousands. The General opens with the hat trick, out comes Mills. a life sized bunny. He does a jig for the audience and they go wild. The General then saws Mills in half, he comes out unharmed of course. Previously Mills had asked for his own session with the audience, The General accepted because he knew what it was like being on that stage for the first time, thousands gawking in amazement of your skill and trickery. Mills then gets a microphone from The General and says ""Ladies and Gentleman, For my first trick I shall- ugh! he then gets tackled by a man from the audience.

Providing you do that, you'll be fine.""

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, ""Nothing is wrong with me - it's this bloody horse. What is he - deaf or something?""

The trainer replies, ""Deaf? Deaf?! He's not deaf. He's blind!""",A jockey is about to enter an race on a new horse,14

says, the man let his curiosity get the best of
him and decided to try the buttons anyway. 

He carefully pressed the first button marked
""WW"" and immediately warm water sprayed all

women really have it made!"" 

Still curious he pressed the button marked ""WA""
and a gentle breeze of warm air quickly dried his
hind quarters. He thought that was out of this

powder puff which delicately applied a soft talc
to his rear. Well, naturally he couldn't resist 
the last button marked ""ATR"".

They had become famous in the city for not having a single conflict in their 25 years of married life. Media gathered at the occasion to find out the secret of their happy going marriage.
 
NDTV corespondent was very curious to know the secret and asked the husband:

""Sir. It's amazingly unbelievable. How did you make this possible? ""
 
Husband: ""We are a happy couple since marriage, thanks to our honeymoon trip to Shimla.""
 
NDTV: ""Sir, tell us about it so that all couples can also be happy like you.""
 
Finally husband agreed to reveal the secret of the happy marriage.
 
""For our honeymoon"" recalling his old honeymoon days husband said, ""We had been to Shimla (a hill station). The day after we both went for a horse ride. My horse was pretty okay but the horse on which my wife was riding seemed to be a crazy one. On the way that horse jumped up suddenly, making my wife topple over. Recovering her position from the ground, she patted the horse's back and said ""This is your first time"".
 
She again got on the horse and continued with the ride. After a while, it happened again. This time she again was calm and said ""This is your second time""
and continued.
 
When the horse dropped her a third time, she just took out a revolver from her purse and shot the horse dead !!
 
I shouted at my wife: ""What did you do you psycho. You killed the poor animal. Are you crazy?""
 
She gave a silent look and said: ""This is your first time!!!""

That's it. We are happy ever after...","25 years married, and not a single argument",207
