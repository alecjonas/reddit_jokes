Sono said, “Every morning and every evening, and whenever anything happens to you, keep on saying, ‘Thank you for everything. I have no complaint whatsoever.’”

The man did as he was instructed for a whole year, but his heart was still not at peace. He returned to Sono crestfallen. “I’ve said your prayer over and over, and yet nothing in my life has changed; I’m still the same selfish person as before. What should I do now?”

Sono immediately said, “Thank you for everything. I have no complaints whatsoever.” On hearing these words, the man was able to open his spiritual eye, and he returned home with a great joy.",The Enlightenment of Sono,0

""That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,"" returns our guy as he takes another large gulp of his beer.

The stranger then jumps out the window. Much to our guy's shock, the stranger -- as if he were a feather -- gently floats down toward the ground.

Once he gingerly makes contact with the pavement, the stranger waves back up towards our disbelieving guy, reenters the building and rides the elevator back to the top floor. Upon seeing the stranger reenter the bar, our guy resolves to try this amazing feat for himself.

He jumps out the window and quickly falls to his immediate death.

One day, on their way to a big congress, James looks into his bosses eyes through his rear view mirror and asks: ""Sir, I have been hearing your speeches from the back of the halls for years now. I'm a bit ashamed to ask you this but....Do you maybe want to switch roles just for today? I'm sure I know the speech by heart now. I would like to feel like an important man too, even if it's just for today"". 
The Professor is both amused and flattered by this proposal and agrees. 

Some time later they arrive at the convention. James quickly changes into a nice suit and makes his way on to the podium. The Professor puts on the drivers hat, and silently finds his way in the back of the hall, behind hundreds of science big-shots. 

At first, everything is going fine. James does a real good job and without stuttering, he plays his role great.
Then, a man in the audience raises his hand and asks a question to which James doesn't know an answer. 
James  immediately starts sweating. His face becomes red and he has to loosen his tie. 

Then James says; ""I'm sorry sir, but that's SUCH a stupid question...really. I mean come on, I bet even the man in the back over there, with the drivers hat on knows the answer to that!"" ",The Professor and his driver,20

The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That’s an exceedingly odd number.

Why was that gauge used?

Because that’s the way they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US Railroads.

Why did the English build them like that?

Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that’s the gauge they used.

Why did they use that gauge then?

Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.

Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?

Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that’s the spacing of the wheel ruts.

So who built those old rutted roads?

Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.

And the ruts in the roads?

Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.

The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. And bureaucracies live forever. So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse’s ass came up with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses.

Now the twist to the story…

When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory at Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs would have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide as two horses’ behinds.

So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world’s most advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a horse’s ass...and you thought being a HORSE’S ASS wasn’t important!",A Horse's Ass,101

 I leaned back, sipping on my coffee, to emphasize my position of superiority. She had a strange look on her face, almost a mixture of anger and confusion that told me that I may have crossed a line.

So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. 
No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. 
""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. 
""Your husband is my best friend!"" 
""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" 
""I can't believe that,"" 
Charlie said. 
""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? 
""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, 
pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" 
Charlie did just that. 
He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. 
So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her.
When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. 
It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. 
Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. 
This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs.
The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke

Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.

When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

Joe laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.""",So Joe had these headaches...,10126

“That’s it”, the urchin shouted and with a puff of sand and dust he turned the hermit crab into a part of the coral reef itself. 

“what the hell, why did you do that?” he asked

A cheerful child is diagnosed with a fatal cancer and doesn't have long to live even with modern treatment, making the child extremely melancholy. As such, the Make-A-Wish foundation approaches the child and his family to provide a single wish. When asked what the child wants, he says that he just wants to laugh in such a dreadful time, which the family and foundation unanimously agree would be nice in a time like this and are fully willing to provide.

The attempts to make the child laugh starts with a doctor who impersonates Patch Adams in a kind and giggle inducing way, but the child remains in his state of melancholy. 

The second attempt consists of a magic show that dazzles as much as it confuses, and is bound to make any child chuckle at least a bit. This fails as well, and the child remains blue.

In a final attempt, the foundation invites a comedian known for being both hilarious and quite profane. After giving a private stand up session to the forlorn child, the comedian comes out of the hospital room, revealing a glowing and cheerful boy. The parents and staff alike are in amazement, and for good reason.

After a brief moment of joy from seeing this child become so happy, the mother asks the comedian, ""How'd you do it?"" To which the comedian replied, ""See, dark humor is like a Make-A-Wish foundation kid; it never gets old!""",The Make-A-Wish foundation and a child,9

He sees his Mom having  a hard time catching her breath and red in the face and decides she must be dying.His father turns to him and screams:

Well the boy figures this must be something that will save his Mom so he dashes off to the basement to find it.  He looks every where growing more and more desperate but cannot find the fuggout.  He asks his brother who looks at him like he's lost it and walks off.

Finally, feeling very upset he goes to tell his Dad he cannot find the fuggout.

He bangs on the door ""Dad! I can't find the-""

THE BRAIN SAID – “Since I control everything and do all the thinking, I am the most important therefore I should be boss.”

THE FEET SAID – “Since I carry him everywhere he wants to go and get him in position to do what the brain wants, I am the most important.”

THE EYES SAID – “Since I must look out for all of you and tell you where the danger lurks, I an the most important body part.”

THE HANDS SAID – “Since I do all the work and earn all the money to keep the rest of you going, I am the most important.”

Of course, everyone got into the arguments and the heart, lungs, and ears all say the same thing.

Finally, the asshole spoke up and pointed that he was the most important even though the others didn’t know it. All the other laughed and laughed to think of an asshole being boss.

The asshole decided to prove the point and refused to function. Blocked up tight.

Soon the brain was feverish, the eyes crossed and ached, the feet were too weak to walk, the hands hung limply at the sides, and the heart and lungs struggled to keep going.

All pleaded with the asshole to relent and agreed that the asshole was the most important and so it happened.

The MORAL of the story is that the asshole always ends up being the boss.

You see, the shoes got bored just going from his local to the flat. They wanted to see the world, like, you know. He had a hell of a job getting rid of them. No matter who he sold them to, they'd show up again the next day. He tried to shut them out, but they just kicked the door down, you know.


Last thing he heard, they'd sort of, erm, robbed a car and drove it into a canal. They couldn't steer, you see.

Petersen was really, really blown away about it. He went to see a priest. The priest told him... he said it was alright and all that, like, and that the shoes were happy and that they'd gone to heaven. You see, it turns out shoes have 'soles'.

post,69jzoy,2qh72,jokes,false,1494054950,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/69jzoy/the_county_fair/,self.jokes,,"Michael Babbitt and his family lived on a small farm outside of Houston. His son, Billy, was a few nuggets short of a Happy Meal, but tried his best to help out. This naturally led to the occasional accident, so his parents quickly learned to give him simple tasks to minimize damage. 

Next week was the County Fair, where Mrs. Babbitt proudly displayed her homemade jams and jellies. Grand Champion four years in a row, and boy was she proud of it.

The whole family was helping out to gather supplies to load up and take over to the fairgrounds, and of course Billy wanted to help out. His mother, working over a hot stove, decided assistance in the kitchen wasn't the best idea and promptly directed him outside to his father, who was packing up the truck. His father, who was loading up a few dozen glass jars, reluctantly handed him a case, warning him to be careful.

As predicted, Billy dropped the box, and shattered an entire case of jars. His father sighed. ""Eight down, 64 to go.""
Unwilling to cause more damage, Michael sent his son to the convenience store, with specific instruction to buy enough lids for the remaining jars. He figured he couldn't do too much damage to metal disks.

Four hours later, the truck is loaded, the last batch of jam is cooling, and Billy is no where to be seen. Just as Mrs. Babbitt was about to call the county sherif (for the third time this week) when he finally returned, out of breath and carrying far too many bags for the task he was sent out on.

He set the bags down triumphantly. ""Here you to dad! Got all the squids you asked for. Had to walk all the way to the Asian market in the city.""

Mrs. Babbitt sighed. Michael, having given him very specific instructions, was understandably furious. He sent him back to the store, and shouted after him,

After a couple of months, the loneliness and sexual frustration starts reeeeeeally getting to him. He even tries subtly beating off in his bunk while the rest of the room's asleep, but gets sharply hissed at from the guy next to him. Bob internally curses that of course he got stuck next to the light sleeper.

After a bit of hushed scolding, the other guy softens up a bit. ""I understand Bob, I really do. We all got urges, just don't wank around the rest of us dude. It's not right.""

""Well what DO I do then?"" Asks Bob frustratedly, ""How do you survive without beating off this long? There aren't even any brothels nearby to pay for a bit of relief!"" 

The guy looks carefully at Bob and after a moment goes, ""You know, you seem on the level. And more importantly, I don't want you wanking in here. There's a tree out about half a mile south of here. It's half hollow, but if you slide your dick in the small hole on the south side of it, you'll swear you were fucking the tightest pussy on earth.""

Bob thinks this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but he's desperate. Of course he goes to check it out the very next night. Lo and behold, there's the tree, and yes, he can see a small hole perfectly shaped to slide a dick into. Shrugging his shoulders, he goes ahead - and the other guy was right! Tight as fuck, warm and soft, Bob half wonders if this is a magic tree. 

Only takes a few seconds for him to bust a nut, he's so pent up. And he returns like clockwork as soon as he has any free time in the evening, the next four times are as good as the first. 

But the next time he comes back, the tree suddenly feels....well, like a hollow tree. Nothing like the last few times. Bob's confused and furious in equal measure, when he sees his bunkmate heading towards the tree too. 

""I think it's broken?"" Bob tries to explain. His bunkmate shakes his head as he loosens the buckle on his belt.

""Nah, Bob, it's just your turn inside the tree""

So they go into the pub, run the routine and it works perfectly. They get thrown out without paying a cent so they continue doing it.

post,69jbpn,2qh72,jokes,false,1494043369,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/69jbpn/the_strange_sound/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...




But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",The strange sound,0
