With the warm sun on her skin and all the sounds of a hot summers day she starts drifting into sleep.

Suddenly she comes fully awake to the sensation of something crawling up her inner thigh! Still groggy she tries to determine what it is, and to her horror she sees the end of a bee disappear into her vagina!

Half panicking she throws on some clothes and heads for her doctor. When the doctor enters the examination room, she explains her predicament and her worry. 

""And you're sure the bee is still inside you?""

""Of course I am! What am I supposed to do about it?!""

""Don't worry, just call your husband and have him meet you at home. Take some honey and cover the tip of his penis with it and let him enter you slowly. When he feels the bee eating the honey, just have him exit you real slow and pull the bee with him!""

Amazingly this plan calmed the woman some, but it had a huge flaw:

""I'm not married, and I have no boyfriend!""

""Don't you have any close friends you could ask to help you?""

""I don't have time for that, can't you do it? It's your plan and everything!""

""Hmm, well I guess the situation is quite time dependent. Lay here on the bed and uncover yourself while I get some honey.""

As the woman got situated the doctor got a bottle of honey from the lunch room. When he returned he took out his penis and covered the tip. Slowly he entered the woman until he was almost completely inside her.

""There he is! He just started eating the honey.""

""Great! Does he stick to you when you pull out?""

""No, he keeps dropping off!""

So, the doctor goes slowly forward and backward and forward and backward trying to pull out the bee, he's getting more and more frustrated since the bee seems to go nowhere. Suddenly he increases his speed to a fast pace.

""What are you doing?! He'll never stick when you're going this fast!""

""I changed my mind, I'll shoot that son of a bitch!""",A woman is sunbathing ... [nsfw],92

He was a real cheapskate when it came to his money. He loved money more than just about anything, and before he died, he said to his wife, ""Now listen, when I die I want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me, because I want to take all my money with me into the afterlife.""

So he got his wife to promise him with all her heart that when he died she would put all the money in the casket with him.

He was stretched out in the casket and the wife was sitting in back next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, ""Wait a minute!""

She had a shoebox with her, she came over with the box and placed it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket and rolled it away.

Her friend said, ""I hope you weren’t crazy enough to put all that money in there with that stingy old man.""

She replied, ""Yes, I promised. I’m a good Christian, I can’t lie. I promised him that I would put that money in that casket with him.""

""You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him?""

They went around the room saying their toasts, when finally it came to Mr. Halligan who thought he may have a winner.

""May we all spend the rest of our lives, between the legs of our wives"" he said.

His friends all agreed that this was the best toast of the night and bought Halligan a round.

Later that night when Mr. Halligan got home he stumbled in the doorway and was immediately confronted by his wife, Mrs. Halligan.

""How was your night drinking with the boys?"" she asked.

""Wonderful,"" he replied, ""we had a contest to see who could make the best toast and I won!""

""Oh what was your toast?"" his wife asked eagerly.

As he was about to tell her, he remembered that Mrs. Halligan was a devout Irish Catholic, and certainly wouldn't approve of the toast he had made. Thinking quick on his feet Mr. Halligan said,

""My toast was, 'May we all spend the rest of our lives, in church with our wives'"".

Mrs. Halligan was elated that Mr. Halligan and his friends voted such a pleasant toast as the best of the night, and kissed him as she went off to bed.

The following day, Mrs. Halligan was at the grocery store and ran into one of her husbands drinking buddies, Mr. O'Doyle.

""Mr. O'Doyle, how great it is to see you. I just wanted to say how wonderful I think it is that you all voted my husbands toast as the best of the night. What a pleasant thought that was.""

Mr. O'Doyle had a very confused look on his face, because he knew Mrs. Halligan quite well and knew that she was a devout Irish Catholic. He never would have thought she would like a toast like that.

""Really?"" he asked. ""You really like THAT toast?""

""Of course I did!"" she exclaimed. ""The only strange this is that Mr. Halligan has only been down there twice this year.

post,50sm1z,2qh72,jokes,false,1472812984,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/50sm1z/horrorific_joke/,self.jokes,,"This Joke finds us on one dark stormy night in some forgotten province of Eastern Europe ,where two men, both suffering from some physical deformity due to lack of adequate medical infrastructure; one man with a hump on his back, the other man, one leg shorter than other.

Walking towards distant train station, they hope to make it in time for the train that passes through in the early hours of the morning. Its currently nearly midnight. Their road takes a winding turn around a large ancient cemetery, possibly started by some old Balkan tribe, or even Romans. The train station lies somewhere directly behind it, the road is the longer way around.

The man with the hump says to the man with the limp: ""Listen I really must catch this train, I want to take a shortcut across the cemetery and get there faster."" 

The man with the limp gulps at the foreboding creepy cemetery flashing up illuminated only by frequent flashes of lighting otherwise lost in the dark torrential rain, and says: ""No way, I've heard stories of this place, of old curses and strange shadows creeping in the night, I'm going the long way around.""

The man with a hump shrugs, they part ways and hope to see each other at the station. He then sets off across the cemetery. 

As the storm around him grows ever more intense, man with the hump treads on. Then suddenly, storm stops, and to his horror he finds himself in front of an ancient crypt, with a shadowy figure emerging, that of a Vampire!

""WhAt is thAt on youR bAck!?!"" an undead graven voice demands.

""M-m-m-my hump..."" the terrified man barely responds.

""GivE it heRe!"" screams the Vampire while lunging at him, with a weird sensation he finds his hump suddenly completely vanished! His back straight, he turns and runs towards the station not even glancing back.

When he finally reaches the safety of the road, he drops exhausted and tries to catch his breath. The man with the limp eventually catches up and marvels in surprise at the new look of the other guy, who frantically explains what happened and where.

The man with a limp wonders if the Vampire could cure his affliction too, cautiously, yet optimistically heads towards the aforementioned Crypt.

As he draws near he sees the shadow rushing out towards him, its the ancient Vampire!

""WhAt is thAt on youR bAck!?!"" the Vampire demands in a voice that makes the guy with a limp shudder with fear, confused, he answers: ""Nothing?""  

""HeRe, hAve A hump!"" hisses the Vampire and vanishes into the night.

Moses plays first, he swings his golf stick with precision befitting a man who has used a staff since dawn of humanity, the ball flies perfectly, almost, when it suddenly falls straight into the lake just shy of the green surrounding the hole.

Unfazed, Moses walks over, spreads his arms, and parting the waters to reveal his golf ball and few flapping fish (don't worry, they will be fine, its heaven). Moses then hits the ball onto the green, walks over and taps it into the hole.

Jesus goes next,  He swings with  such grace and precision, sending the ball hurtling towards the green, then behold, as it lands on the very edge of the green, on the very point where it meets the water. 

Jesus casually walks over, takes position impossible for a mortal man by standing on the water itself to hit the ball straight into the hole, one less hit than Moses.

The old man goes last, his old bones slightly creaking as he hits the ball rather clumsily, with the ball wobbling erratically yet straight towards the deepest part of the lake. 

As its about to hit the surface, a fish jumps out! It swallows the ball, but just before its back safely underwater an eagle comes swooping down and clutching the fish with its talons; He soars upwards towards the skies, suddenly a thunder-strike hits the Eagle, it drops the fish, fish lands on the green, ball rolls out of its mouth and straight into the hole.

The man is teaching his wife to play golf, and she pulls off a very powerful shot, however, in the completely unintended direction, straight into the small grove surrounding a lone mansion.

In horror they watch as the ball smashes right through a window! The man goes pale, realizing that he has all his golf balls sharpied with his full name for easy recognition. They rush over hoping they can retrieve it before anyone sees them.

As they approach the large open floor deck and now shattered massive window leading into the slightly darkened living room. Creeping inside and listening out to any indication that the owner is around they look for the ball inside. Suddenly they notice it sitting on the floor next to a broken, VERY expensive and very old looking ceramic Urn. 

As the man bends down to pick up golf ball responsible; he finally notices a figure reclining in the chair nearby. The other man sitting there is large, muscular, with dark, Mediterranean or even Egyptian complexion and chiseled features. He is oiled up and completely nude! He is not even bothering to cover up.

With a deep and gruff heavily accented voice he speaks: "" I thank you for freeing me from my prison, mortal! I have been trapped in that urn for over thousand years, for finally releasing me I shall grant you any wish you desire. Your wish is my command!""

The man and his wife sigh with relief and quickly discuss what they should ask for, finally they ask: ""Please Genie, We want to be super rich like just like owner of this place, to have a mansion just like this, with vault full of gold and diamonds!"" 

The Genie nods, and says ""So it shall be done, go to sleep tonight, and tomorrow you shall wake up in your new life. But now I must ask you for a yet another favor, you have given me freedom, but I have been so alone inside the urn for so long, I wish to lay with your wife, as I must regain my power to perform this magic.""

The man instantly agrees, even the wife is not against the idea, the genie is rather godlike in his form...
The man sits in the lounge dreaming of all the cool stuff he will be buying tomorrow, trying to ignore the thumping noise and screams of carnal pleasures coming from upstairs, a small price for such riches -he reasons.

The sweat drenched Genie, comes down several hours later, and asks: ""Tell me by the way, how old are you?"" 

""33"" the man answers.

Just as I was about to go back in and apologize to my wife, I see this pair of hands holding onto the kitchen window ledge. I grab the meat tenderizer from the kitchen counter and proceed to smash his fingers, I see him fall 15 stories, hit a tree, then a bush. 

Then I see him trying to crawl away... I don't even know how, or where I got the strength, probably the adrenaline from rage and running up the stairs; I lift the refrigerator, and hurl it through the window at the guy below.

Just as I saw that I got the bastard, I suffer a heart attack, and next thing I know, I'm up here.""

Suddenly this maniac comes with a hammer or something and starts hitting my fingers, unable to hold on, I fall all the way down, by some miracle hitting a tree and landing in the bush.

In agony, but happy to be alive I look up to thank god for letting me survive, when I see this fridge falling straight at me... Next thing I know, I'm up here.""

While working overseas Tom gets a letter: 
""Dear Tom, your cat is dead. Jim""

Tom is bewildered with grief and writes back to Jim:

""Dear Jim, is there really no way you could have been a bit more gentle with such news, it came as such shock. 

You could have written me a few letters, something like: Your cat is suddenly often walking on the roofs, and I am worried that he will fall off. 

Then in next letter you tell me that the cat has fallen off the roof, and that the Veterinarians are doing everything they can.

And THEN you conclude in a third letter that the cat has passed away, that way I am prepared for such shock.

The bone is exposed.

He stares into your soul.

His jawbone shifts uneasily.

""But what is bone?""

he asks.

You weep softly.

His gestures puncture the wall now.

You ask, again, if he feels pain.

He goes on a tangent about how pain is related to nerves.

You feel it.

Deep within you.

""But... what are, nerves?""

He is a skull now.

You are no longer within a room.

You are in a void.

There is only you.

A skull.

And an eyebrow.

Floating softly above.

He grins.

""But what is... void?""",But what is Vsauce?,3

They do some routine work, collecting rock samples, checking temperatures and the like.

Then one of them sees a man in the distance sitting on a deck chair wearing a handkerchief with knots on each corner on his head licking an ice cream. He turns to the other astronaut and says ""Who the hell is that!"". So they go over and one of the astronauts asks ""Who are you!?"" to which the man replied ""Can't you see? I'm God!"". 

""Well God, what are you doing here in such a desolate place like the moon?"" said one of the astronauts.

""I'm on holiday! Can't you tell?"" replies God.

""Well why the moon?"" said the astronaut.

""Well it's like this, last year I went to Mars: All these funny little green men running about all over the place, I didn't like it. The year before that I went Venus: Far too hot."" Says god.

Now this astronaut had an idea, he thought "" If I can get him to come back to Earth with us I might be able make some money out of this, play it of as the second coming off Jesus!""

So the astronaut asks God ""Why don't you come to Earth, it's much nicer down here there's warm blue sea's and blue skies and long golden beaches - a beautiful planet! I can give you a lift!""

To this god tells them ""Earth! Don't talk to me about that place! I went there over 2000 years ago, got some woman in the pudding club and they're STILL talking about it now!""

post,50nryy,2qh72,jokes,false,1472744038,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/50nryy/the_camping_story/,self.jokes,,"A couple of years ago I went out camping in the woods with a few of my friends. It was a dark and stormy night, and we felt very alone in our little tent, so we started telling scary stories.

I described how the hills we were in used to be coal mining country, and the coal mines were dark and dangerous. If you didn’t die from coal lung you’d die from cave-ins, and if you didn’t die from either of those, you’d starve to death on the miniscule wages they paid you. The mine just up the hill from us was the worst. The manager had an extortion racket that he was keeping hidden from the owners - he would demand a “tribute” of 50% of the day’s wages from each of his miners, or he would think up a reason to get them fired. Pay was starvation level even without giving the manager his cut, and so after a few months of this tribute the miners became pale, sickly, and emaciated. Paradoxically, they started working harder and harder, hoping they would strike it rich enough to get a bonus that they could use to get out of that awful place.

One of the miners worked even harder than the others. He just kept digging and digging, and when he looked back, he’d gone too far, left everyone else behind, and couldn’t find his way back. Life out there was so bad he found he barely cared. He just kept digging and digging and digging, figuring that working himself to death was as good a way to go as any other.

Finally he came to a vein of rock darker than any he’d ever seen before, and when he broke through it - wham! - he had dug all the way to Hell. Satan came over to meet him, and told the miner that they had a problem. He couldn’t stay in Hell, because he wasn’t a sinner. But he couldn’t go back either, because the rules say no mortal may leave Hell alive. So Satan offered him a deal - he would transform the man into a vengeful ghost, who could spend eternity possessing mortals and driving them to madness.

The miner thought a bit, but he wasn’t convinced. The only guy he wanted to possess and drive to madness was his evil manager who had stolen a tribute from every one of his paychecks. After getting revenge on him, he wasn’t sure he wanted an eternity of possessing random other people. Satan suggested that maybe he could spend eternity possessing people and talking about how evil his manager was, so as to make his name forever dishonored. The man thought that was a good idea, and so with a word Satan transformed him into a spirit. He spent a while haunting his evil manager, then after that possessed random other people in the area to give monologues on how exploitative his manager’s labor practices were.

And so, I finished, sometimes, on nights much like tonight, with groups of campers much like our own…

“Hold on,” interrupted my friend. “Is this going to end with you saying that you’re possessed right now, and that’s why you’re telling us this story?”

“Um,” I said…“I guess that…”

Just then the police burst into our tent. “Stop right there!” said one of the officers. “You’re under arrest!”

“For what?” I asked.

“Possession by a miner within tent to diss tribute.”",The camping story,25

He says, ""We've been as brothers for longer than I can remember, and while I was not rich in life, I would like to bring some wealth with me as I die. If you could each leave $5,000 in my coffin, it would bring me great peace.""

The three men saw no fault in this, as they were all very rich, and all upstanding members of their respective communities.

Jim was a devout, aging Catholic, and he brought the five thousand in large bills, so as not to occupy much space in the coffin. He later told the members of his congregation, and oh how they lauded him on his selflessness to ease the mind of a dying friend.

Michael was a converted Muslim, and he feared that the dead had no use for paper money, so he converted the five thousand into gold for his friend, leaving the ingots next to the bills. He felt a great warmth inside of him, a feeling that can only be brought about by a good, charitable deed.

David was born Jewish, but wasn't so devout as many of his colleagues. He refused to buck off the stereotype and worked as a moneylender, a loan agent. Because of this, he understood how exchange rates worked and how trying to convert 3 different types of money to one may be hard for a man with little experience handling cash. Therefore, he wrote a check for fifteen thousand dollars, and took the gold and bills as change.

post,50mbl2,2qh72,jokes,false,1472721198,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/50mbl2/once_upon_a_time/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was a farmer who owned a small farm. He didn’t have many animals, but he did have two he loved immensely: his dog Spot, and his prize winning race horse, the fastest horse ever to run in the Kentucky Derby, Bolt. One day, the farmer and Spot were in the stables to watch a mare give birth to Bolt’s child. But to their surprise, the mare gave birth to not one, but two, strong, healthy foals. The farmer named the first born Buck and the second Casper.
From the very beginning, Buck and Casper shared their father’s competitive spirit. Within seconds of both being born, Buck looks at Casper and says “Hey brother! Let’s see who can stand up first.” Casper agreed, “Challenge accepted.” Buck tried to stand first, got half-way erect, and then fell over. Next Casper tried to stand, made it all the way up, wobbled, and fell down. Spot and the farmer watched intently, as this continued back and forth for a couple minutes, each brother standing a little longer than the other, until eventually Buck stood up and remained standing. “I win!” exclaimed Buck. “You sure did,” Casper replied “but it was very close. I know I’ll win next time!”
Some time passes, and the farmer decides that Buck and Casper are now old enough to be let out of the stables and explore the farm. The farmer, Spot and all the other animals gather around to watch the two young horses get their first taste of the outdoors. As soon as the two foals exit the stables, Buck turns to Casper and says “You see that fence across the field? Let’s have a race! First one to the fence and back wins.” “You’re on!” Casper replies.
And so the two horses take off towards the fence. First, Buck takes the lead, then Casper pulls ahead, then Buck takes the lead again as they reach the fence. On the way back the two horses are neck-and-neck, Casper ahead one second, Buck the next. Casper gives his all and takes a slight lead. “I’m going to win” he excitedly thinks, but at the last second Buck has a burst of speed and pulls ahead by a foot, winning the race. “I win!” Buck neighs loudly. “You sure did brother,” Casper replies “but that was very close. I’ll win the next race, I just know it.”
Having witnessed their race, the farmer decides to enter them in the next local horse derby. The farmer and Spot sit in the stands, watching with anticipation as the horses line up, Buck and Casper next to each other in lanes 3 and 4. “This is it! This is the race I’m going to beat you!” Casper says to Buck. “Probably brother! You are very fast and trained very hard” Buck says in return. At the sound of the gunshot, Buck and Casper take off out of the gates. They very quickly get way ahead of the other horses, and the two brothers stay neck-and-neck. First buck is ahead by a few inches, then Casper gets the lead, then Buck again, then Casper; back-and-forth until it seems like Casper finally has the lead. “I got it this time!” Casper whinnies in excitement, but suddenly Buck is right there next to him, and before Casper could dig deep for a burst of speed, they cross the finish line, Buck just a few inches ahead. “Drat!” Casper says, a little upset. “That was so close! I could taste victory.” “It was a very good race brother!” Buck says, “I’m very proud of you, that was the closest we’ve ever been. I thought you had it for sure.”
A few years pass of Buck and Casper racing, training, and growing. Year after year the farmer enters them into the races, year after year the farmer and Spot watch, and year after year Buck wins by a hair, with Casper getting closer and closer with each race. Finally, Buck and Casper are so fast and so famous – The Twin Bolts, they’re called – that they both get invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. On the big day, the farmer and Spot watch from home on the TV as Buck and Casper wish each other luck, and go to their gates to await the race. The starting gun fires, and all the horses take off. This time it’s a very close race; all the horses stay tight in a pack for most of the track. But near the end, all the horses begin to tire and slow – all the horses except for Buck and Casper.
Casper manages to get a good lead, and he looks back to his brother and yells “I’m going to win this time, there’s nothing you can do!” But his cockiness got the better of him, and the farmer, Spot, and Buck all watched in horror as just before the finish line, Casper loses his footing and takes a terrible fall, knocking himself out.
After the race, Casper wakes up back home in the stables, Buck watching over him intently. “How do you feel Casper” Buck asks with concern, but Casper can think only of the race. “Did I win?” he asks. “Did I finally beat you?” Buck shakes his head solemnly “I’m afraid not brother. You stopped just in front of the finish line. The race was stopped because of your injury, but I was declared the winner since I was in second place.”
Casper is devastated by this news. “…but …I was going to win” he says sadly, trying to stand. But one of Casper’s front legs gives him a sharp pain, and he falls over. “Are you okay Casper?” Buck asks, concern heavy in his voice. “The vet said you broke your leg. You need to give it time to heal.”
And so he did, but time never fully healed his leg. For years, Casper stayed at the farm, limping as he tried to run, while Buck continued to win Derby after Derby, eventually breaking his father Bolt’s speed record and winning more Derbies than any other horse in memory. Spot would watch Casper from the porch, saddened by the state of the once proud equine.
Many years later, the farmer retires Buck from racing. The two horses, now old, spend most of their time in the stables, Casper always quiet and sad. One day, Buck turns to Casper and says “You know brother, I miss the old days when we would race side-by-side. What do you say to one last race, huh?” But Casper shakes his head and says “There’s no point. Even in my prime, I could never beat you. What chance do I have now that I am old and lame?” Saddened by his brother’s depression, Buck gets an idea. “You know what brother? You’re the reason I ran so fast. You inspired me, our whole lives, to push myself and be the best I could be. I always looked up to you.” This makes Casper a little happy, so Buck continues “I bet that you, my greatest inspiration, will beat me. There’s no way you’ll lose again, you’re too good”. “Alright,” Casper says, his spirits high for the first time in years “I’ll race you. To the fence and back, just like when we were kids. And this time I’ll win!”
As Buck and Casper exit the stables, Spot – now also very old – pads over to watch. The two horses start running, much slower than in previous years, but still with as much intensity as their younger selves would muster. Casper, his excitement allowing him to ignore his old injury, takes the lead. Buck, digging deep, catches up, and they continue neck-and-neck. On the final stretch, Casper pulls ahead. After so many years, he’d finally get to know what it felt like to be number one, first place, the winner. Casper had never felt more proud or excited than at this moment in his life. But just before as he reaches the barn, Buck bolts past him, winning by a hair. Casper is crushed.
Now Spot, who watched the young horses grow up from afar, gets angry at this. He walks up to Buck and growls “Why?! After all the years, after all your victories, why? You couldn’t let your brother have this one race? You just broke his heart!” To which Buck replies
“Holy shit, a talking dog!”",once upon a time,8

post,50m3ce,2qh72,jokes,false,1472716102,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/50m3ce/letter_home_from_summer_camp/,self.jokes,,"Dear Mum &amp; Dad,

Our Scoutmaster told us to write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and got worried. We are okay. Only one of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Adam when it happened.

Oh yes, please call Adam's mother and tell her he is okay. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search and rescue Jeeps. It was great. We never would have found Adam in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.

Scoutmaster Ted got mad at Adam for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Adam said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas will blow up?

The wet wood didn't burn, but one of the tents did and also some of our clothes. Matthew is going to look weird until his hair grows back.

We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Ted gets the bus fixed. It wasn't his fault about the crash. The brakes worked okay when we left. Scoutmaster Ted said that with a bus that old, you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance.

We think it's a super bus. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the bumpers. It gets pretty hot with 45 people in a bus made for 24. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the policeman stopped and talked to us.

Scoutmaster Ted is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Horace how to drive on the mountain roads where there aren't any cops. All we ever see up there are huge logging trucks.

This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out to the rapids. Scoutmaster Ted wouldn't let me because I can't swim, and Adam was afraid he would sink because of his cast (it's concrete because we didn't have any plaster), so he let us take the canoe out. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.

Scoutmaster Ted isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the bus so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.

Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Andrew dived into the lake and cut his arm, we all got to see how a tourniquet works.

Steve and I threw up, but Scoutmaster Ted said it was probably just food poisoning from the left-over chicken. He said they got sick that way with food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and became our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time. By the way, what is a pedal-file?

I have to go now. We are going to town to post our letters and buy some more beer and ammo. Don't worry about anything. We are fine and tonight it's my turn to sleep in the Scoutmaster's tent.

Love Johnny",Letter home from summer camp,9

Thankfully, with him is a young deacon in training, so the priest whispers to him,
""listen, I need you to take over a few of these confessions for me while I duck off to the bathroom, I'll only be gone a few minutes.""

""But father!"" Says the deacon in a hushed panic,
""I don't know what to do! We haven't learned confessions in the seminary yet!""

""Don't worry, it's easy,"" replies the priest.
""just look here at this list on the wall. Whatever their sins are, just find it on the list and it will show the appropriate penance. The people confessing won't even see you from behind the screen anyway, you'll be fine. I'll be back soon.""

So the first punter walks in to the booth and the nervous deacon opens the screen. The man confesses to be stealing money from his work. The deacon looks down the list, and sure enough finds ""stealing - 2 hail Marys,"" gives him his penance and sends him on his way.

The second person walks in, a man claiming to have problems with anger, and that he struck his wife the other day.
The deacon looks down the list, and finds ""hitting - 1 Our Father.""
Tells the man to say 1 Our father as penance, and sends him on his way.

A woman then enters. 

""Forgive me father, for I have sinned. I'm married, but I gave a blowjob to another man.""


The deacon scrolls down the list... blowjob... blowjob... no blowjob. He doesn't know what to do, it isn't on the list.
The deacon begins to panic, but luckily he then notices an altar boy is nearby, so he whispers to him.

""Pssst, listen I need to know something, what does father give for a blowjob?""

Due to a bizarre technicality in the letter of the law their check had to be based on a straight line measured between two point on their body. Being generous, the administration allowed them to pick the two parts, offering $10,000 per inch (the maximum by law).

The first general came in and said ""Son, I want you to measure from the tip of my toes to the top of my head."" He walked away with a check for $720,000.

The second general came in and said ""Son, I want you to measure from the tip of my toes to the top of my outstretched arms."" He walked away with a check for $980,000.

The third general, a particularly grizzled old man came in and said ""Son, I want you to measure from the tip of my dick to the back of my balls.""

The clerk responded by saying ""General, no offense, but the other checks gi-""

I recently heard a lecture that was talking about who most accurately judges the quality and promise of creative work. There was a study where psychologists measured who was most correct in their determination on the value of creative work.

This study found that managers are really bad at measuring creative work. They're scared of looking bad and down value everything. They down value it something like two levels too low, the bastards. The creator of the work, though, is also bad at valuing the work. They're so wrapped up in it that they over value it at two levels better than it is. The people who are most accurate are peers. Peers value the creative work of other creators with fairly good accuracy.

Now this is all pretty interesting in its Goldilocks way. But when I heard about all this I was most interested in the second evaluator. I was interested in how we evaluate our own creative work. And most particularly I was interested in how accurate my own evaluation is of my own work.

What, I wanted to know, does this study say about how good my own work is? How good, for instance, is this that I'm writing now? I was delighted to find it tells me how good through a simple mathematical analysis.

Assuming (as is the basis of the study) there is an absolute quality to this piece of creative work, we know from the study that I am, because I am writing it, valuing it at two levels better than it actually is. So demoting how good I think this is by two levels we come out with...

Bubba said, 'Shingles' So she wrote down his height, weight, a complete medical history and told Bubba to wait in the examining room.

A half hour later a nurse came in and asked Bubba what he had. Bubba said, 'Shingles..' So the nurse gave Bubba a blood test, a blood pressure test, an electrocardiogram, and told Bubba to take off all his clothes and wait for the doctor.

An hour later the doctor came in and found Bubba sitting patiently in the nude and asked Bubba what he had.

I screwed up enough courage to smile at her and say hello. Apparently that was enough for her to take interest, and even though I wasn't that into her once the initial novelty wore off, we spent the next few months dating.

3 months later, it turns out that she's a virgin, and we still have not sealed the deal. This was fine with me, I was patient and respected her choices. At the end of one particularly memorable date, I pulled up in front of her house to drop her off and she leans over and kisses me before getting out of the car. I decided to go for broke and grabbed the back of her head, continuing the kiss a lot longer than usual. Things began to get hot and heavy and I could tell she was into it, but she was also incredibly nervous.

""I'm sorry Ender, I have to go, my grandmother's waiting for me inside.""

""That's cool, can I meet her?""

""Ummmm, sure, I guess....""

So we go inside and introductions are made. We chat for a while and grandma tells me stories, like what Christmas was like in the 40's. I make Grandma laugh several times and she ends up adoring me, as most Grandmas do.

Finally it was time to go. I said goodnight, and it was then that she smiled at me, winked, and nodded her head towards the stairs. I was totally expecting to just head home as usual, but it looked like my charm lit a fire in her and the situation was about to change for the better!

We eventually make it up to her room, and while she was incredibly nervous, I finally got her completely naked and things really started getting wild at that point. I never expected it, but she was a complete animal! That night may have been the best sex of my life.

At one point she stops me and says ""Maybe we should take a break.""

""Why, is everything ok? Did I hurt you?""

""No it's not that, it's just that I think I hear my granddaughter crying downstairs, and I really don't want to deal with that again tonight.""",Dating a virgin,45

In response, this man whips his tallywhacker out and puts it in the gator's wide open mouth before punching the gator in the side of the head. Shockingly enough, the gator keeps his mouth open around the man-meat. The man asks if anyone in the bar would like to give it a shot, and the only one who raises their hand is a wrinkly old nutsack-skin looking old man, you know, one of those old guys that's constantly shaking that you feel bad for? Anyway, the gator owner notices his hand up and says, ""yes, you?""

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’

""There is more to tell, Father. She started to repay me with sexual favours. This happened several times a week and sometimes twice on Sundays.""

The priest said, ""That was a long time ago and by doing what you did, you placed the two of you in great danger but two people under those circumstances can easily succumb to the weakness of the flesh. However, if you are truly sorry for your actions, you are indeed forgiven.""
