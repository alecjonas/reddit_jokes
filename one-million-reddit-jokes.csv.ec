Then, there are the mega upper class, bourgeoisie frosted Cheerios. They are the ruling class, and they hold all the upper roles in society. One day, a plain Cheerio is working in the field, and he sees a beautiful frosted cheerio princess. So he goes up to her and asks her out to the cheerio ball. She says ""I'd like to, but you're a plain Cheerio. We could never be seen together."" So the plain Cheerio goes to the cheerio elder, and asks him for advice. The elder says ""you must go to froot loop mountain, and ascend it. At the top you will find the god Toucan Sam. You must consult him. So the cheerio goes to the mountain, and he climbs and he climbs and climbs, and he finally reaches the top. So he enters the toucan temple, and meets toucan Sam. Sam says ""who dares to disturb my slumber"" and the plain Cheerio says ""oh great toucan Sam, I request that you make me into a frosted cheerio"" and Sam says ""I won't make you a frosted Cheerio, but tell you what. You work for me for 7 years, and I'll make you a honey nut Cheerio."" The plain Cheerio thinks this is fair, so he works for 7 years. At the end of 7 years, he is finally made into a honey nut Cheerio. So he goes down the mountain, and finds the princess, and he asks her if she wants to go the ball with him. She says ""no, I still can't, because you're just a honey nut Cheerio. Maybe if you were frosted, but no. So he goes back up froot loop mountain, and asks Sam if he will make him a frosted cheerio. Sam says ""yes, but this time you will work for 10 years for me"". So the honey nut Cheerio works for 10 more long years. At the end of this time, he is finally made into a frosted Cheerio, and he is very content. He goes back down the mountain one last time, and asks the princess out. She says yes, and the protagonist is overjoyed. So they go to the ball, and they're dancing and dancing and dancing, and eventually the princess gets tired, and asks him ""do you suppose you could get me some water?"" So the protagonist goes to the water line and waits and waits and waits, and he finally gets to the front, but they are out of water. So he goes to her and says that there is no water. So she asks him to the milk line, cause Cheerios drink milk. So he gets in line and he waits and waits and waits, but then he gets to the front and there's no milk. So he goes back to her, and says that there's no milk. She says ""what about some punch?"" So he looks around, but there was no punch line.","So, there's a world, and it's only inhabited by Cheerios.",7

Flabbergasted, the bartender starts fixing him up a drink and says. ""Holy hell thats impressive, where did you even get something like that?""

""Oh, earlier this week i found a genie lamp in your dumpster out back and he granted me a wish. Its probably still out there."" The man replied.

With that, the bartender sprinted out back and found the lamp. Excitedly he grabs and rubs it and as the man said, a genie came out of it.

""I am the mystical genie! I will grant you only one wish so make it count!""

""I wish for a million bucks!"" The bartender shouted.

""Your wish... Has been granted!"" The genie bellowed and disappeared back into the lamp. Just then, a million ducks flew overhead of the bartender, who watched in dismay.

The man from earlier was sipping his drink when the sulky bartender came back in.

""That genie was a crook. I wished for a million bucks and i got a million ducks instead."" The bartender says with a frown.

You know if God did design this place you have to wonder who it was for? Him? or us? or was it just out there as a statement? Was it meant to be modern? or was it traditional? 

But seriously, having studied design myself at college I do not think it would have got a good grade. The design is very wasteful - look at all that empty space. And the light is only available during the day. Heating and cooling are unreliable and the place is full of vermin and mildew. 

So without tearing it to pieces any further, let's try to imagine a very considerate God, that had at least a bachelors degree in Architecture, OK? You would start with a type of thing you want to build - call it a ""world"" and you would want to specfy who and what it was for. For people, a place where they could get everything they needed - but wait a minute, there were no people. And the design went ahead without any idea of people till the end, and then it was men only. 

So, let me back-up. Let's say we want a habitat for humans to live in. We want them to not need food or shelter and to all be good people with altruistic personalities. No criminals, no cheapskates, no creeps. Just nice people, thinkers, artists, musicians - great music - especially stuff you can dance to and sing, good books and an enormous amount of films for free. Free sex - within reason - no childhood, start with grown ups and add in some permanent baby pets - puppies. No aging, no disease. No money. Lot's of outdoor activities, swimming, tennis, skiing, nature walking - guess some nature will have to be provided. And all sorts of games available. On TV there would be no reruns. 

We also did not need oceans or stars or continents. Keep everything easy to get to and fish-flavored food would be available all the time. But there would also be no tooth decay or cavities and no calories. So, guess what? You could eat sweets all day - milk shakes, ice cream, cheese cakes. And you could get high whenever you wanted to. People who wanted to take a break could either go to sleep for any duration they liked or enter into another reality. All transport would be free and probably gravity would be altered so that you could float around and, why not, let's fly. 

As there is no money everyone is as rich or poor as they like and can have everything they want. But you cannot enslave anyone, so it would have to be robots but you could also always get the boy or girl of your dreams - and only good dreams. 

Yeah, I would have done a good job and life would be so much better.",Who needs Heaven or Hell?,0

Not only was he the first Non-Italian pope elected in over 400 years,  he was the first Polish Eminence elected ever. That being said, the biggest concern about his election was the fact that he was not Italian and the members of the Catholic church in Rome were worried about John Paul the second proficiency in speaking Italian.

Of course, as pope he did speak Latin as all the prayers are said in Latin.  However the multitude of Italians who gathered in Saint Peter Square on a daily basis spoke Italian and not Latin. The main concern was would John Paul the second history’s first polish pope be able to clearly Speak with all Italians.

As it was his first official day as Pope, his first task was to address the multitudes in St Peter’s Square. His camerlengo was nearby to assist.

The pope began his address...

“Tante Salute a  tutti uomini”  I salute all men. 
Turning to his camerlengo The pope ask how was that?

Camerlengo: that was great your holiness. But today with women’s Lib , we must also recognize women.

Pope: don’t worry. I got this.

Tante Salute a tutte Femine (I salute all women)

Used by US Federal Aviation Administration, it's a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane’s windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies.

&amp;#x200B;

The theory is that if the windshield doesn’t crack from the carcass impact, it’ll survive a real collision with a bird during flight.

&amp;#x200B;

Hearing about the chicken cannon, the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on their brand new, speedy locomotive they’re developing.

&amp;#x200B;

They borrowed FAA’s chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired.

&amp;#x200B;

The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, broke the engineer’s  chair and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine’s cab.   They did the test the second time with the same result..

&amp;#x200B;

The British were stunned and asked the FAA to send a technician recheck the test to see if  everything was done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

The FAA technician arrived and reviewed the test thoroughly, ""Hmmm, I see.. and ok.  Let's do the test again boys but this time, let's use a thawed chicken.”","So, have you guys heard of a chicken cannon?",22

A roman, an american, and a jewish man all died yesterday. They were immediately sent to hell because they had commited some pretty daunting offences in their lives. The roman was a lustful sex offender, the american was extremely gluttonous, and the jewish man was very greedy and stole lots of money over his lifetime.

Well, God was feeling pretty generous and decided to give the three men a second change on Earth. He gathered the men into his throne room and told them, “I will give you 24 more hours on Earth. If you go these 24 hours without commiting your deadly sin, you will be granted an extra 10 years of life on Earth and a one way ticket to Heaven. But, if you commit your deadly sins, you will immediately be sent back to the deepest circle of hell.” The three men unanimously agreed and were sent back to Earth to begin their trial. 

The first thing the american did was buy out an entire hot dog stand and ate all of the food as fast as he could. Then, POOF! The american was gone. 

The first thing the jewish man saw was a 20 dollar bill sitting neatly on the sidewalk. He bent over to pick it up, and POOF! The roman was gone.",One of my favorite jokes..,66

""Dear Sir:

Please find enclosed a complimentary pirate's costume. The handkerchief can cover your bald head if you'd like, and with your wooden leg you will be a great pirate.

The man thinks this is terrible because they have just emphasized his wooden leg, and so he writes a letter of complaint. A week goes by and he receives another package and a letter, which says:

""Dear Sir:

We are quite sorry about the misunderstanding. Please find enclosed a monk costume. The long robe will cover your wooden leg, and with your bald head you will really look the part.

Now the man is really upset, since they have gone from using his wooden leg to using his bald head! So again he writes the company another letter of complaint, being particularly nasty about how they've failed to meet both conditions with their previous attempts. The next week he gets a much smaller package and a note, which reads:

The ringmaster blinks a couple of times and says, ""Are you talking?""

""Of course I'm talking,"" the crow replied with a scoff. ""I talk, I speak seventeen languages, I sing baritone with perfect pitch. I'm diverse. And my demands are few.""

Getting over his shock, he leaned forward in his chair and eyed the crow. ""Demands, eh? What could this miracle crow want from me?""

""Well, you see, I love exotic food. I don't get a lot of really good, tasty stuff pecking at garbage cans and floor scraps. People out there just don't understand me, they need context. A circus is just the right place for a talking crow, wouldn't you agree?""

He not only talked, he even rambled a bit, the ringmaster thought. ""Yes, of course. You are certainly very special. But what is it that you want from me?""

""I hear that your circus travels the world. I want you to take me with you. Set me up with some good food everywhere we go and I'll make your circus the most famous in history.""

That sounded like a good deal to the ringmaster, so he extended a finger toward the crow. ""I believe that can be arranged.""

The crow smiled (as much as a crow can smile) and took his finger in one  claw, giving it a shake of agreement.

And off they went! In St. Petersburg, the crow wowed the crowd with stories of the old czars in flawless Russian. Night after night, more and more of the citizens came to the circus to hear the incredible crow speak. And waiting for him back at his personal tent every night was a huge plate of pirozhki which he devoured in delight.

In Barcelona, word was beginning to spread about this amazing bird and the crowds grew even larger. In the big top, the crow sang the most tear-jerking old Spanish love songs while one of the other circus performers played the acoustic guitar. When he got back to his tent the last night of the circus, the ringmaster brought by a full paella which he began to peck down in earnest.

In Munich, the crow had the largest crowds they had seen yet rolling with drinking songs, made even funnier because they were of course sung by a crow. Back at the tent, the crow (getting fatter with every stop) impatiently awaited the ringmaster, who entered and sat down a brinming plate of wursts. The crow began to peck them, toss them into the air, and catch them almost swallowing them whole.

""Easy now!"" the ringmaster exclaimed. ""I don't want come get you for your next packed house and find you talons up with a bratwurst sticking out of your gullet.""

The crow ignored him and continued devouring his meal.

When they landed in Rome, the crow, bigger and fatter than ever, amazed the sold-out crowds with Italian arias sang with such beauty that they wept openly. After the show, the crow feasted on not one but three full plates of pasta.

Suddenly the ringmaster burst into his tent. ""You are never going to believe this! His Holiness the Pope has requested an audience with you and I tonight! He's heard about this miracle bird and he wants to see you for himself. Incredible!""

The crow flapped his wings in delight! ""See, I told you you'd be beyond famous!""

The ringmaster grinned and then quickly frowned as the crow's breath reached him. ""Good heavens, how much garlic could you possibly have eaten? You can't address the Pope with breath like that. Here,"" he said, taking a bag of candy out of his pocket. ""Freshen up with one of these and we'll depart for the Holy See.""

The crow reached his beak into the bag and fished out a peppermint and without thinking, swallowed it whole. Or, at least, attempted to. The sweet lodged itself in his throat and the ringmaster, having no idea how to Heimlich a bird, watched as his priceless star ran out of breath and keeled over.

""I always thought it would be the sausages or the lobster or the steak,"" he cried out tearfully. ""I never would have thought the real choke would be in the caw mints.""",A crow flies into the tent of the ringmaster of an internationally famous circus.,18

He knew how crude his schoolmates could be and it wouldn't do for her to be exposed to such filth as these cretins would be likely to subject her to.

The whole week that she visited, she would stay in the room while he had class. When he was free, they would hang out in the room or even spirit away to the next city over and have a night out, but he was always very careful to never bring her around those animals at his school. He knew they couldn't be trusted and would love to say disgusting things to her or worse!

On the last night of her visit, while studying in the library, he fell asleep. Alone at the hotel, she waited for him, but when hours had passed, she ventured out into the night to find him. She started at his dormitory and that was a mistake. As she wound through the hallways, boys popped out to ogle her. The farther she went into the den of horny young men, the bolder these perverts became.

Here, an ass flashed in the doorway; there, she saw a young man openly stroking his cock! Her skin was too dark to reveal her flush, but she was mortified, and still she looked for him.

Up to the second floor, where the boys were in a lather with this cute young woman in their midst. They laughed as one after another bared their asses to this innocent, shy, young lady. She tried not to look, but when she did, she was surprised to find that she was starting to feel flushed for a different reason. The only sign she gave was that her pace slowed as she looked at all these nude or half nude men showing off for her— even if it was horribly rude.

Meanwhile, in the library, the young man awoke and discovered that he'd overslept. He rushed home, passing his dormitory, just as his lovely Pawnee girl came out the door. When she saw him, she grabbed him by the front of his shirt, pulled him to her and smothered him with kisses. He was surprised, but not unpleasantly. Moments later he was even more shocked when she began to fumble with his belt, and then his zipper.

In the middle of the street on a warm, humid night, she pulled him to the pavement and mounting him, rode his cock until she came, screaming his name to the top of her lungs.

He lay back, gasping for air; she collapsed on top of him. Face to face, breathing heavily he stared at her in awe.

""What happened to you? You have always been so shy!""

She said, ""Yes, I was, but that was many moons ago...""",His Native American girlfriend was really shy...,22

A few days later he receives a package with the following letter:

""Dear Sir:

Please find enclosed a complimentary pirate's costume. The handkerchief can cover your bald head if you'd like, and with your wooden leg you will be a great pirate.

Very truly yours,

Faye's Costumes""

The man thinks this is terrible because they have just emphasized his wooden leg, and so he writes a letter of complaint. A week goes by and he receives another package and a letter, which says:

""Dear Sir:

We are quite sorry about the misunderstanding. Please find enclosed a monk costume. The long robe will cover your wooden leg, and with your bald head you will really look the part.

Very truly yours,

Faye's Costumes""

Now the man is really upset, since they have gone from using his wooden leg to using his bald head! So again he writes the company another letter of complaint, being particularly nasty about how they've failed to meet both conditions with their previous attempts. The next week he gets a much smaller package and a note, which reads:

""Dear Sir:

You will find enclosed a bottle of molasses. Pour the molasses over your bald head, stick your wooden leg up your ass, and go as a caramel apple.

Very truly yours,

The boy coughs up two of the pennies, but keeps choking.

Looking at his son, panicking, the father starts shouting for help.

A well dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.

At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.

After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last penny, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the penny.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, “I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?”

“No,” the woman replied. “I’m with the Internal Revenue Service.”","A father and his young son go to a restaurant and to keep him occupied, he gives the boy three pennies to play with.

But, without hesitation, the waiter produced a replacement from the pocket of his apron. 

""Thanks so much,"" said Linda. ""But I'm curious: why did you have that extra spoon?""

""Well ma'am, we are committed to fast and efficient service here,"" the waiter replied. ""We have studied the restaurant business extensively and found that 90% of dropped utensils are spoons. Just by carrying one extra spoon, a waiter can save two minutes and 47 seconds per shift by not having to return to the kitchen when one is dropped.""

""Wonderful!"" replied Linda. ""Thanks again!"" But as she took her first sip of soup, her eyes were drawn a bit lower, to a string hanging out from behind the waiter's apron. Her curiosity got the best of her. ""As long as we're talking, I must ask: what is that string for? Is that an efficiency thing too?""

""Delighted you asked, ma'am. As a matter of fact, it is!"" The waiter expounded, ""As I said, we are committed to fast and efficient service, and studies have shown that the average waiter can save three minutes and 38 seconds each shift if he doesn't stop to wash his hands in the restroom. To that end, each male member of the waitstaff ties a string around his penis. This allows him to extract himself for urination without touching his genitals, removing the need for hand-washing and freeing up more time to wait on tables.""

Linda finds the idea off-putting, but the waiter is so very refined and self-assured, she is inclined to accept this strange idea and move on . . . until a natural follow-up question emerges: ""That's all well and good, but . . . how do you get your penis back in your trousers once you've finished?""

post,bwvrtt,2qh72,jokes,false,1559691385,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bwvrtt/joe_and_the_talking_trees/,self.jokes,,"Joe was a simple and serious man. He was a carpenter in a small village named Arge Oaks where he owned the store ""Joe's Carpentry.""  
  
For years Joe impressed his fellow neighbors with the highest quality carpentry work. Some people in town complained he was a bit too expensive, but no one ever questioned the quality of his work. He was the best and business was good.  
  
In fact, it was so good that the other carpenters in town, jealous of his success, started to rename their stores to things like ""Joe's Woodworking"" and ""Joe's furniture"" in an attempt to steal his business.  
  
Furious with his fellow carpenters, and more than a little hurt, Joe formulated a plan.  
  
""I'll show them."" Joe said, muttering to himself. ""I'll go to the deepest part of the forest to find the best and most rare wood! Once I have it, I'll craft the most amazing piece of furniture ever built!!! I'll put it right outside my shop, so everyone knows who the rightful Joe is!""  
  
Determined, Joe set off the next day at dawn. He went deeper into the forest than ever before, and then deeper still. After several days of hiking he came upon a clearing with three trees in the center. Amazed, he approached the trees with wonder; the wood was better quality than anything he had ever seen.  
  
""They're magnificent, these are exactly what I needed!!"" Joe exclaimed while reaching for his axe.  
  
""Why thank you Joe."" Said a gravelly voice. ""We have watched you for some time.""  
  
""Uh... wh.. who's there?"" Asked Joe, brandishing his axe and shaking with fear.  
  
""We are the Ents of the forest Joe, we tend to all the trees throughout our domain."" Said another voice, the same yet distinct from the first.  
  
Joe looked up into the trees, trying to find the source of the voices. Gazing into the branches he saw what appeared to be faces in the bark of each of the trees... angry faces. Their eyes were smouldering red, and they had furious scowls that only gnarled wood could produce.  
  
""You've been carving up our brethren Joe. YOU WILL SUFFER."" Said the Ents in unison and they attacked Joe with all their fury.  
  
""I didn't know!!! Please, spare me!"" Cried Joe, but to no avail.  
  
He was bludgeoned, scratched and beaten, but not defeated. Joe knew wood, he knew it well, and he had all the tools to chop down the toughest of trees. So he mustered his strength, and attacked with everything he had. Chopping, hacking, sawing, and breaking. All the while the Ents screamed at him with wild fury, seemingly possessed. Once Joe had gotten over his initial shock, he realized the trees were fairly slow, and it wasnt hard to avoid their attacks. Finally, after what seemed like days, the battle turned in his favor, yet the Ents continued their attack, even in the face of defeat.  
  
""Please, just calm down."" Joe said, exhausted. ""I dont want to hurt you anymo-"" A branch smacked him in the face, and he chopped it back. ""STOP! You guys are living miracles, I dont want to kill yo-"" \*Whap\* A small twig hit him right in the family jewels. Enraged and exhausted Joe's mind snapped.  
  
""I said, CALM DOWN! \*chop\* CALM DOWN! \*chop\* CALM DOWN! \*chop\*"" Every time he said calm down he chopped again and again with the axe, til nothing was left moving.  
  
""There,"" he whispered with a crazed look in his eyes ""you're calm now.""  
  
He started crying and whispering to the dead wood, begging it to talk again and apologizing while kissing the mangled branches.  
  
""You're ok, you're just calm now. I'll take you back home my friends."" Joe whispered maniacally.  
  
For weeks Joe dragged the dead Ents back to Arge Oaks. With each passing day he fell deeper into madness, whispering to the wood.  
  
When he finally returned to town, Joe rebuilt the Ents as much as he could and left them in front of his store. They were glorious works of art and the whole town gathered to ask Joe about his trees with faces.  
  
""They aren't trees!"" He snapped, his eyes roving crazily around. ""They are ents, and they can talk!!""  
  
The crowd looked around uncertainly.  
  
""Well, why aren't they talking?"" Yelled a man in the back.  
  
""They are just calm."" Said Joe, kissing a trunk and whispering madness. Unnerved, the crowd dispersed.  
  
Joe kept making amazing furniture, better even than he used to, but he kept whispering to the ents and kissing them. Soon enough the people of the town stopped caring about his quirky way with the ents, ""It's just part of his wood-working genius"" they would say. Life got back to normal.  
  
About a month later a rich land owner came to the small village to commission the famous Joe for a elegant table. Looking around the village he saw three separate carpentry stores with Joe in the name. Baffled, he asked a local where he could find the actual Joe.  
  
The local raised an eyebrow and pointing towards Joe (who was stroking and kissing the rebuilt ents) the local said,  
""Here in Arge Oaks, everyone knows that' the real Joe kissin the calm ents.""",Joe and the Talking Trees,21

However there was one joke which he thought was lame, so he threw it away somewhere in his house and forgot about it.

The Comedian started inviting some Celebrities to his ""joke house"" to challenge them to read every joke without laughing.

Surprisingly a number of them showed up, however each of them didn't last the first few jokes on the door without starting to laugh.

The young comedian started to get bored since none of those whom he has invited posed a true challenge to him, however that all changed when he heard a knock on his door and someone said ""Pffft such shitty jokes, why does he call himself a comedian?""

He opened the door to find Kevin Hart, knowing that he probably heard every single joke that has been ever made he thought that a joke unique enough to make him laugh and give a good review about him will make his career skyrocket. He was very excited to see him laugh on a joke of his, even if just one.

Kevin read the jokes on the wall, he didn't laugh.

He read those on the table, he didn't laugh.

He read those on the couch, he didn't laugh.

The comedian started growing more nervous by the minute, until Kevin Hart read the very last jokes in the corner of his bedroom, he also didn't laugh.

The comedian was devastated as he wasted his golden opportunity to promote his career, and as Kevin walked through the room to leave the housex he lit his cigarette.

BAM!

The smoke detector went on and water sprays launched causing Kevin hart to become fully wet.

At that moment the comedian was certain his career was done, he went into his closet to bring Kevin Hart some clothes to change into.

When Kevin hart wore the comedian's sweater his back started itching, only to find a paper with a joke written on. It was the comedian's lame joke. The comedian saw that and covered his face in horror. Only to be surprised by the sound of Kevin hart laughing loudly.

Kevin then said ""Oh man that was beautiful, the real joke is in the garments""","A young comedian wanted to make himself famous, so he covered the interior of his house with Jokes",10

And my boy,and this is hardest pull to swallow doc,my boy Gregory Linovich,I no longer love him.As much as it hurts me to say,when I look in his eyes all I see is the cowardice I see when I look in the mirror.


If that cowardice was stronger,perhaps I can bring myself to reach that loaded gun on the bed side.

So the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a minature piano and sets it on the bar, then he reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a frog and sets the frog at the piano.

Low and behold the frog cracks his little fingers and starts to play!

The barkeep is just blown away by this and agrees that the man can drink for free for the rest of the night.  Meanwhile there is a wealthy business man watching this unfold from a corner, so he gets up and approaches the man sensing a business opportunity.  He says ""Excuse me, but I saw your frog and I was wondering if he was for sale?""

The man replies ""Sorry the frog is not for sale"" and continues sipping his drink.

The businessman offers $10,000 for the frog, which the man again politely declines, followed by offers for $20,000 and $30,000.  Until the business man finally gives up and goes back to his seat.

The man finishes his drink and asks the barkeep ""Hey, if I can show you something else even more amazing, would you let me drink here for free any day?""  The barkeep thinking he has seen everythig now readily agrees, what coul dbe more amazing than a playing frog?

Well the man reaches into another pocket and brings out a mouse and puts him on top of the piano.  A few secons lader the mouse starts to sing along with the frog's playing!  The barkeep is absolutely floored by this and again agrees to honour his deal.

The business man also sees this and again approaches the man, he offers $100,000 for the frog and the mouse, which the man again declines.  The business man in a last ditch effort says ""OK, what about $100,000 just for the mouse?""

The man takes a sip of his drink and says ""Just for the mouse?  Yeah OK""  so the business man cuts him a check right there, and takes the mouse and leaves.

The barkeep says to the man ""Are you crazy!?""  A mouse like that has got to be worth 10x that much!  What were you thinking?""

The man calmly sips his drink and replies with a wry smile ""The jokes on him, the frog is a ventriloquist.""","A man walks into a bar and sits down He asks the barkeep ""If I can show you something you have never seen before, can I drink here for free tonight?""",6881

The bad news was, the poor man suffered lots of cuts and bruises and even a concussion. The good news was, the entire country knew where Nathaniel and Claire were now.

The cops were immediately sent to catch the duo. Within seconds, one cop was already on the scene, shouting ""Hands up!"" over and over. The duo ran from the cop and went to a hot, stinky tunnel infested with rats.

Nathaniel said, ""I think the police argon.""

I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over.. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.
Love, Papa

A few days later he received a letter from his son.

Dear Pop,
Don’t dig up that garden. That’s where the bodies are buried.
Love,
Vinnie

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left. That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

Dear Pop,
Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That’s the best I could do under the circumstances.
Love you,
Vinnie....",Fuck the Police,18

Meanwhile, a bear in a bush spotted the fish. He thinks 'if that fish comes a few inches closer to the bank, I can easily snatch him.'

Meanwhile, a hunter has his sights set on the bear, but doesn't have a clean shot. He thinks 'if only the bear would come out of the bush just a few inches, i would have a clean shot.'

Meanwhile, a mouse is eyeballing the hunter's lunch. He thinks 'maybe he won't notice me if I move slowly, a few inches at a time.'

Meanwhile, a cat is watching the mouse close in on the hunter's lunch, waiting to pounce.

In an instant, the fly moves down the log, the fish jumps the for fly, the bear lunges for the fish, the hunter shoots the bear, the mouse runs away, and the cat jumps for the mouse but misses and lands in the river.
