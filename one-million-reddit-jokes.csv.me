He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

shaolin kung fuThe monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

so everyone in class started using it as well to say things like ""I brought my from the bungalow today"" or whatever and the teachers HATED IT

it started getting out of hand when we were learning about the presidents and we often needed to say ""the white house"" so of course we would say ""the white bungalow""
the teacher was so furious and than there was a ban on the word and if anyone said it they were sent to the office. I remember the kid who started all this, once got in trouble for something petty like sharing his homework with a classmate, and the teacher said that she was going to call home to his mom and he just stood up and cried out: "" No Ms ....! Please don't call Home !

and there was this huge silence because he just raised his voice to the teacher

and than a huge smile spread across his face and he said

""call bungalow instead""

and i swear the whole class rioted ... it was amazing

Hi Bob, This is Alan next door. I’m sorry buddy, but I have a
confession to make to you. I've been riddled with guilt these past few
months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to
your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can’t live with
myself a moment longer without you knowing. The truth is I have been
sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact,
probably more than. you. I haven’t been getting it at home recently,
but that's no excuse, I know. The temptation was just too much.  I can
no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest
apologies and forgive me. I promise that it won't happen again. Please
come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.
Regards, Alan.
 
THE ACTIONS:
Bob, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, and shot his
neighbor dead.  He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink
and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone where he saw he has a
subsequent message from his neighbor.

THE SECOND MESSAGE:
  Hi Bob, This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the slight typo on
my last text. I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you
noticed that my Autocorrect changed ‘Wi-Fi’ To ‘Wife’. Technology
hey?!? Hope you saw the funny side of that.

Suddenly the horse falls into a mud hole and starts sinking. He tells the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farmer, but the farmer can't be found.

So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend and drives forward saving the horse from sinking. A few days later, the chicken and horse are playing in the meadow again, and the chicken falls into a mud hole. The chicken tells the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse says: ""I think I can get you out.""

So he stretches over the width of the hole and says: ""Grab hold of my 'thing' and pull yourself up.""

The chicken does this and is pulled to safety. Moral of the story: If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.

The driver, a young man, slows down, leans out of the car window and asks the shepherd: ""If I tell you how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?"" 
The shepherd looks at the young man, then turns to his flock and answers calmly: ""Sure why not?""
The young man then pulls out his laptop, connects it to his cellphone and to the Internet, navigates to a NASA page that scans the area and makes a photo in ultra-high resolution. He then opens a digital photo program and exports the image to a Silicon Valley laboratory in California that immediately sends him an email on his PDA confirming that the image is processed and the data fully stored. After a few minutes he receives an answer and at the end prints a full 150 pages report and looking at the shepherd he says:  ""You own exactly 1586 sheep.""
""That’s correct, well, I guess you can take your sheep now,"" says the shepherd and he looks at the young man pick up an animal. As he is about to put it in his car, the shepherd asks: ""Hey, if I can guess your profession, will you return the sheep to me?""
The young man thinks about it for a moment and says: ""Okay, why not?""
""You are a liberal congressman"", says the shepherd.
""Wow, it is true"", says the young man, ""how did you guess?""
""Well, there is not much to guess, it seems quite obvious"" replies the shepherd ""you appeared without anyone looking for you, you wanted to be paid for an answer I already knew, to a question no one asked you, and you know sweet fuck all about my job. Now give me back my dog!""

Me tried committing suicide by jumping off a building, but she was stopped by someone named Somebody. He had the same story. His mother wanted his name to be Jacob, but she said:

- Somebody in our family should have the same name as him.

The two fell in love at first sight.

There was a steamroller that everyone on Earth loved. It's shiny yellow color could attract anyone. It was named The World for that reason. Somebody had a magical power. He could predict the future. One time he predicted that there'd be an earthquake on 4th March 2008. Everyone was safe thanks to him.

- Me, you know that famous steamroller?

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. 

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday! "", and possibly have a present for me. 

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. 

My kids came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. 

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" 

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment."" 

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back."" 

""Ok."" I nervously replied. 

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... Followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". 

And I just sat there... 

On the couch... 

In my birthday suit.",Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning,1

""Ah, I'll give 'em to the pet store. Somebody else's problem.""
Well this just would not do for this church-going woman, so she offered to take the bird off the young man's hands. He insisted, ""Ah no, Miss Wainwright, you don't want this old bird! He used to belong to my father before he passed, and he's got a real mouth on him."" 
Gladys insisted right back and sealed the deal with saying how lonely she would be without him to help her with the gardening. The young man relented, shaking his head, and thinking to himself that he had warned her before passing the cage off.

The bird was quiet the first night, and Gladys figured that all the bird really needed was to get away from those loud video games. 
The next morning she awoke and walked downstairs to the kitchen, passing the cage on the way. 
""HEY OLD BITCH! WHERE THE HELL'S MY FUCKIN' FOOD?"" The parrot screeched at her.
Shocked, she turned slowly on the spot to stare at him. And then she spoke, ""Now I don't know what you got up to next door, but that just won't be tolerated here!""
""FUCK YOU, DRIED UP OLD CUNT!"" 
Gladys snatched the bird out of the cage and carried him to the kitchen, ignoring his loud curses and wing flapping. She held him up and said to his beak, ""You need to be taught some manners! You sit in here and think about your language, birdy!""
She popped him in the freezer and turned away to make some tea. 
When the kettle had boiled a minute later, she opened the freezer to reveal a shuddering parrot that was glaring at her, but saying nothing. Smiling in a satisfied way, she removed him and placed him back in his cage. 
The next morning, Gladys totters down the steps and coos, ""Good morning my pretty little birdy!""

""AH, FUCK THIS! YOU CAN SUCK MY FEATHERY COCK LADY!"" 

Gladys promptly popped the bird in the freezer again, but this time while boiling the kettle her daughter called. By the time she had gotten off the phone with her third grandchild, she realized she had quite forgotten the bird.
Hustling back over to the freezer as fast as her rheumatism would allow, she wrenched open the door and found her bird alive, nearly frozen. 

As she removed him the bird said in a small voice, ""Alright lady, I'm real sorry... But I gotta ask.. What the HELL did that turkey say?""",An old woman asks for her neighbor's parrot..,38

""May I please use the restroom?""

The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should.""

""Why not? "" the nun asked.

""Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private part is covered only by a fig leaf. ""

""Nonsense,"" said the nun, ""I'll just look the other way.""

So the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she proceeded to the restroom. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again. However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.

She went to the bartender and said, ""Sir, I don't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?""

""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender. ""Would you like a drink?""

He goes up and asks what the deal is. Apparently, this guy has never laughed. He says that it costs 5 dollars to enter, and whoever does it gets the whole jar. The jar has an absolute fortune in it.

So he takes the old guy to another room, and after a few seconds, there's this uproar of laughter. The guy walks out, clutching his sides. The man picks up the jar and leaves.

The man comes back after a year, and the old guy is back too. This time, he's got a sign that says ""5 dollars to make me cry."" So he takes the old man the the other room, and there's this depressed sobbing, like he ripped the guy's soul in half. He picks up the jar and makes for the exit.

He's stopped by a bar patron, who asks him a question. ""We've been trying to break that guy for years, but you did it both times. What did you say?"" The man leans in close, and tells the patron:

""The first time, I told him my dick was bigger than his. The second time, I proved it.""
