post,7h9i9f,2qh72,jokes,false,1512305854,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7h9i9f/there_was_an_elderly_nurse_working_overnight_in/,self.jokes,,"There was an elderly nurse working overnight in an emergency room. She had been doing this, and doing it well, for 45 years. She was a good nurse, always sharp as a tack, but she was getting to the point in life where she was just starting to get endearingly scatter brained. She would frequently get sidetracked mid-conversation. Things like telling a story about her dog in the middle of giving report to the next shift. The doctors and other nurses all loved her, but on a busy night they could get understandably frustrated with her. 

Now the nurse's name was Ursula Rachel McConnell, and she insisted on being called Ursula Rachel. She was raised in a staunch Catholic household, and her parents always made sure she understood the importance of using her full Christian name. Ursula Rachel was a little odd, but she wasn't stupid. She knew that her name was a mouthful and sometimes there just wasn't time in an emergency to use her full name every time. So she reluctantly agreed to answer to the nickname U.R., but only in an emergency.

A new doctor had just started working in Ursula Rachel's emergency room. He was fresh out of medical school, and did everything by the book. Very no-nonsense. As such, he found Ursula Rachel's few quirks to be more annoying than most. He complained to the other doctors and nurses about her idiosyncrasies being a waste of time, but they all brushed him off, saying he would get used to her.

One night, towards the end of a particularly busy shift, Ursula Rachel answered the ambulance phone and took report from two separate crews of paramedics, both bringing in patients having heart attacks, one male, one female. They were five minutes away from the hospital. Ursula Rachel had seen thousands of heart attacks in her long career, and wasn't worried. She casually told the other nurses to get two rooms ready for them. 

The new doctor happened to be working that night, and after the crazy shift he had nearly survived, he was flustered. He was moments from going home and collapsing into bed, but then he overheard Ursula Rachel say something about two heart attacks on the way. This would be his first time treating one, and he was nervous. So he walked over to Ursula Rachel and asked if he had heard her correctly. Ursula Rachel turned to him and said, ""Yes, doctor. But actually, you're just the person I wanted to talk to. Maybe you could explain this. My dog was out digging in the yard earlier today and he came back inside chewing on some kind of root...""

But the doctor interrupted her. ""Ursula Rachel,"" he said, ""focus. You said there were two myocardial infarctions on the way into the hospital right now. How far out are they?""

Ursula Rachel looked down at her watch and said, ""Oh, about two minutes now, doctor. But like I was saying, little Milo was chewing on a root or something and he just wouldn't stop drooling. Milo is a St. Bernard, mind you, so he's a drooler to begin with, but this was...""

And the doctor interrupted again, ""Ursula Rachel, we don't have time for this. I'll take the patient going in to room 5, and Dr. Smith can handle the other one. Tell me about the myocardial infarction going into room 5.""

Ursula Rachel looked at him and said, ""They're on the way, doctor. But this drool just kept pouring out of poor Milo. I didn't want him to choke, so I...""

The doctor was yelling now,  ""I know, I know! He drools! But the patient! I need to know about the patient! Which one am I getting?!""

Ursula Rachel scowled at him. ""You're being rude, doctor. I'm trying to tell you about poor Milo's drooling and you're being a jerk.""

The young doctor was completely exasperated at this point. It was nearly time to go home, and he still had a myocardial infarction to stabilize before he could sleep, and this nurse was impossible to deal with. So he finally shouted at her, 

""I KNOW U.R., BUT WHAT M.I.?!""",There was an elderly nurse working overnight in an emergency room.,47

He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and said, ""I would like to go in and meet with President Trump.""

The Marine looked at the man and said, ""Sir, Mr. Trump is no longer president and no longer resides here.""

The old man said, ""Okay"", and walked away.

The following day, the same man approached the White House and said to the same Marine, ""I would like to go in and meet with President Trump."" The Marine again told the man, ""Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Trump is no longer president and no longer resides here.""

The man thanked him and, again, just walked away.

The third day, the same man approached the White House and spoke to the very same U.S. Marine, saying, ""I would like to go in and meet with President Trump.""

The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, ""Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Trump. I've told you already that Mr. Trump is no longer the president and no longer resides here. Don't you understand?""

The old man looked at the Marine and said, ""Oh, I understand. *I just love hearing it*.""

The Marine snapped to attention, saluted, and said, ""See you tomorrow, Sir.""","A joke from the future (January 2021, to be precise)",43

Embarrassed he quickly looks away and nothing is said.  
A little while later the soldier sees the same man hanging around the gym area with some other soldiers. After some others leave, it's just the two of them.  
The first solider very curious, but very shy, says, ""hey, I'm really sorry, and I'm embarrassed to ask, but I noticed you had a tattoo on your penis and I have never known anyone who did before. I thought I seen some writing on it and just wondering if you could tell me what it says"".  
The other solider not being shy says, ""hell, there isn't anyone else here, I could just show you"".  
The first solider embarrassingly agrees, as he is too curious to pass up to see what it says. So the solider unzips his pants, pulls it out and gives it a couple tugs to stretch it out. The 1st solider then sees the writing and reads out;

The people were shouting “Saul has killed his thousands and David has killed his ten thousands”; this really pissed King Saul off big time. How do you get rid of a Hero? And so King Saul hatches this fine scheme to get David killed by the enemy--a dead hero and Saul is not to blame. The king tells David, “I’ll give you my daughter’s hand in exchange for 100 Philistine foreskins”. David jumps at the chance, no problem and brings back 200 of the nasty things. Now remember, the Philistines were large people, so that was a big load of flesh so David used a wheelbarrow and brought the whole lot and dumped them into the kings court, and then said “where is my new wife?” Well he gets his wife but that seems to be where this story ends until some research dug up the rest of the tale. Here sits King Saul, spitting mad, staring at a big pile of dirty foreskins only 10 cubits away from his stately throne, so he shouts “will someone get these abominations out of my sight!” One of his counselors approaches and gently speaks, “your highness, I know of a craftsmen in Jerusalem who can create great garments from tiny skins. He made a robe of rodent hides that has made my own surly wife much easier to live with.” “Let it be done,” the king commands, “Just get them out of my sight now”! About two weeks later this craftsman is standing in the king’s outer court with news of success. When he was led into the king’s presence, Saul asks “what creation do you have to offer me from that mess which was delivered unto you”? The craftsman hands him a simple wallet. “200 foreskins of my enemies yield only this slender wallet”?  The craftsman replies: “If you rub it a while, it turns into a full set of luggage.”",David and Goliath,1

The captain said, ""Well, if it's good for morale, then I guess it's all right with me."" 

After he had been at the fort for about 6 months, the captain could not stand it anymore, so he told his sergeant, ""BRING IN THE CAMEL!"" 

The Sarge shrugged his shoulders and led the camel into the captain's quarters. The captain got a foot stool and proceeded to have vigorous sex with the camel. As he stepped, satisfied, down from the stool and was buttoning his pants he asked the sergeant, ""Is that how the enlisted men do it?""

So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife did not want to have any more children. 

The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. 

The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (big firework), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. 

The Alabamian said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me."" 

So the couple drove across the state border into Georgia to get a second opinion. 

The Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama. 

The doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and coun t to 10. 

Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. 

He held the can up to his ear and began to count '1, 2, 3, 4, 5...' at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand. ",Alabama vasectomy,3437

The fight continues in the courtroom until the judge finally brings calm with the use of his gavel, shouting ""Silence in Court."" The courtroom goes silent and DANNY (the best man) stands up and says, ""Your honor, I was the best man at the wedding and I think I should explain what happened."" 

The judge agrees and asks Danny to take the stand. Danny begins his explanation by telling the court that it is traditional in an Austrailian wedding that the best man gets the first dance with the bride. The judge says ""OK."" 

""Well"", said Danny, ""After I had finished the first dance, the music kept going, so I continued dancing to the second song, and after that the music kept going and I was dancing to the third song. All of a sudden the groom leapt over the table, ran towards us and gave the bride an unmerciful kick in her privates.""

Last Wishes

Doug Smith lived all his life in the Florida Keys and is on his deathbed and knows the end is near.

His nurse, his wife, his daughter and two sons, are with him….

He asks for two witnesses to be present and a camcorder be in place to record his last wishes, and when all is ready he begins to speak:

“My son, Bernie, I want you to take the Ocean Reef houses.”

“My daughter Sybil, you take the apartments between mile markers 100 and Tavernier.”

“My son, Jamie, I want you to take the offices over in the Marathon Government Center.”

“Sarah, my dear wife, please take all the residential buildings on the bayside on Blackwater Sound.”

The nurse and witnesses are blown away as they did not realize his extensive holdings, and as Doug slips away, the nurse says, “Mrs. Smith, your husband must have been such a hard-working man to have  accumulated all this property.”

The wife rolls her eyes and replies, “The asshole had a paper route”",Last Wishes,78

Then, when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor.

Just then, the doorbell rang and an irritable Santa trudged to the door.

He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.""

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, ""If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""

""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.

""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father, ""but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have."" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humour me, dear father.""

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. ""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls."" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible."" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again."" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""

""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

""I- I-""

Then he died.",A day before his 15th birthday,0

The moth drops down into the chair and says ""What's the problem? I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrel in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgmental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""
The dentist stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a dentist. You need a psychiatrist. Why did you come in here?""
The moth says, “Your light was on.""",A moth goes to the dentist.,71

post,7gvbne,2qh72,jokes,false,1512138801,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7gvbne/the_christmas_tree_chronicle/,self.jokes,,"My dad and I went out to buy a Christmas tree a few days ago, and this year we decided to go all out and get a really big one. Since we had just moved and we now have 14 foot ceilings, there would finally be room for one of those massive Christmas trees everyone fantasizes about. I, of course, had to come along to help lift it because dad's back isn’t what it used to be.

So we get to the store (if I hadn’t mentioned, we still go with artificial trees) and there's nothing on the shelf. We were kinda pissed because we called in earlier to make sure one was there. We assumed someone had bought it but we dragged over an employee anyway. The employee says that they had actually helped someone buy it not 20 minutes ago but they thought there were more in back since the store had received some Christmas trees earlier that morning.

10 minutes pass, he doesn’t come back

20 minutes

My dad is livid now for various reasons and he sends me off to find the employee which I finally do, and he's helping a couple. When there's a break in the conversation he looks at me in shock. He claims he ""forgot about us""

Bullshit.

At this point I’m pretty pissed but the employee was more than happy to help us now (probably because he was terrified and felt bad, whatever). I go with him this time but he won’t let me in the receiving area (which is fair). FINALLY after a couple of minutes he comes out with one of the 10' trees. He then helps us roll it to the cash. The thing is massive. Now I knew the store would try to push some type of extra crap on us like tree warranty or something and that’s when I saw a pamphlet to have one of their employees go to your house and set up your tree for you for an extra 25 dollar charge. I thought “who needs that? We have 2 capable men right here who can do it.”

We get to the cash and dad starts to pay and just as I expected... the cashier says:

“Are you going to put that up yourself?”

and my dad says

""Don't be disgusting. I'm going to put it up in the living room""

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

Having dealt with the uprising, Santa expelled the three elves from Lapland. He gave each of them a colour to make sure he knew where they were. 

The first elf was given the colour yellow, and was known as ‘mean elf’. He was sent to Croatia, where he started his own textiles business.

The second elf, Arrogant Elf the Blue, was sent to the US, and she was also successful. 

The third elf was always very rude, and was given the colour red. He was sent to the UK, where he really struggled to make anything of his new life. He only really enjoyed camping, and struggled with British weather. 

One day Santa and Mrs Claus went to visit the third elf. They found him sitting outside on a horrible, stormy day. Mrs Claus told Santa she was very worried about him being out in such horrible weather. 

Santa laughed and replied:

“Rude Elf the Red knows rain, dear.”

Dear Broken Hill High School,
God bless you for the beautiful wireless I won at your recent Senior Citizens luncheon. I am 87 years old and live at the St Anne's Nursing Home for the Aged. All my family has passed away so I'm all alone. 
I want to thank you for the kindness you have shown to a forgotten old lady.
My roommate is 95 and has always had her own wireless; but, she would never let me listen to it. She said it belonged to her long dead husband, and understandably, wanted to keep it safe.
The other day her wireless fell off the nightstand and broke into a dozen pieces. It was awful and she was in tears. She asked if she could listen to mine, and I was overjoyed that I could tell her to f**k off.

Thank you for that wonderful opportunity.
God bless you all.
Sincerely,
Edna",A true story..,14

The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat
The doors were all bolted, and the phone off the hook
It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.
Momma in her teddy, and I in the nude. Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube
When out on the lawn there arose such a cry, That I lost my boner and poor momma went dry.
Up to the window I sprang like an elf, Tore back the shade while she played with herself.
The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built, Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.
With a fat little driver, half out of his sled, A sock in his ear, and a bra on his head.
Sure as I'm speaking, he was as high as a kite.
And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.
Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz, Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.
Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree, Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.
They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub, Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.
And then from the roof we heard such a clatter, As each little reindeer now emptied its bladder.
I was donning my jacket to cover my ass, When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.
His suit was all smelly with perfume galore, He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.
That was some brothel, he said with a smile, The reindeer are pooped, I'll just stay here awhile.
He walked to the kitchen, himself poured a drink, Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.
I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee, The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.
Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack, But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.
The first thing he found was a pair of false tits, The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.
A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find, And a six pair of panties, the edible kind.
A bra without nipples, a penis extension, And several other things that I shouldn't even mention.
A cock ring, a G-string, and all types of oil, A dildo so long, it lay in a coil.
This suff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit, So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split.
He filled every stocking and then took his leave, With one tiny butt plug tucked under his sleeve.
He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead, Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.
In time he was seated, took the reins of his hitch, Take me home Rudolph, this night's been a bitch!
The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout, The best thing about sex is that it never wears out!",‘‘Twas the night before Christmas,18

post,7gqlkw,2qh72,jokes,false,1512084020,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7gqlkw/girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So, I recently moved in, and this girl, who's moving three doors down from me, has a moving truck pull in. And I notice she's alone. Let's keep in mind, that this is me. So, on a good morning, I'm like a 6/10. But this chick, she's a solid 9. Absolutely gorgeous, almost super model status and beautiful enough to be on TV. So I walk up to her and say,""Hey, do you need some help moving these inside the house at all?"" And she looks at me, with the nastiest look on her face and goes,""Yeah, no. But thanks."" Like, hit me up with the real white girl stuff y'know? So, I'm like, Alright.
The next day comes around and her little stupid puppy jumps over her fence and into my front yard. So, I pick up the dog and knock on her door. And she goes,""Oh my goodness, thank you. I don't know what I would've done without him. He's like the only person I know around here."" And I'm just standing there goin'; it's not a person. She's like, one of those white girls y'know? Ugg Boots and Pumpkin Spice Lattes.
And then, she says,""I'm sorry about yesterday. I was so angry and I just took it out on you. Let me take you out to dinner."" I'm goin' like holy... Alright, lemme one up ya here.
""If you let me pay, we can watch a movie together."" She agrees, and we go out to eat and watch a cool movie. We don't have much in common, I'm into video games and anime, and she's into makeup and, white girl stuff. But we compliment each other nicely.
So, next day comes around. And I notice another moving truck pull in, three doors down in the other direction. And this chick, she's a 7/10. She's cute, glasses and long black hair.
I go up to her and say,""Do you need any help moving these boxes in?""
She looks and me and says,""Oh my gosh yes, I was so worried that no one would come by and help me. Three cars drove by, can you believe that? Anyways, take this box in, it goes in the living room which is the first door to your right. I'll see you inside.""
I grab the boxes, and I'm goin' like: That. That was a lot.
But as I'm moving, I look at the side of the box and notice it's labeled ""Video Games,"" I take a peek inside, it's not taped very well. And I see some serious fricken video games, I'm talkin' Secret of Gaia Mint Edition, and Final Fantasy VII First Press.
I call out to the girl,""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?""
She replies, saying,""No, no. I don't have a boyfriend, that's all my stuff.""
And I drop the box off, thinkin', Holy crap, what am I going to do.
So, we decide to hang out for a little, play some video games, and get a bite to eat. It was a great day. And we were both interested in the same thing, video games and anime.
So, a few days go by, and it's been the best of my life, I've got the 9/10 arm candy, absolutely gorgeous, and the 7/10 girl on the side, to just hang out with.
Well, one day, my girlfriend comes up to me, and says,""I don't like you hanging out with that other girl.""
I looked at her,""Why?""
""Because,"" she turns red,""I'm getting kind of jealous and it sucks.""
I then tell her, ""Well, she's a lot like me, and if you like me, you should like her. Just go hang out with her for a bit okay?""
""Well, okay."" then the both of us go out and do stuff you would do in the first two months of a relationship. Whatever that is.
Couple days go by, and 9/10 girl comes into my house saying,""Yeah, you're not going anywhere near her anymore.""
""Oh come on, why?""
""She said she was going to '-blam!-ing murder me' that is a direct quote from her.""
""Alright, I'll go by her house and ask her what's up.""
So, I go out to 7/10 girl's house and knock on her door; no answer. I call her and text her, no answer.
I go by 9/10 girl's house and do the same thing, no -blam!-in' answer.
The next day, same thing. No answer. Whether or not the two ran away together or this is just some horrible coincidence I will never know. Days turn into weeks, and weeks into months...
After a few more weeks, I turn on the TV, and notice this article or headline with a picture of 7/10 girl. And. Uh, she's covered in blood.
She was screaming, yelling,""She's dead, you're next!"" Directly at the camera.
And I'm just sitting there, thinking to myself. I just lost my nigh-on perfect girlfriend. Well, a few more days go by and the autopsy report starts to come back.
And, parts of my girlfriend were missing. It seems that the 7/10 girl had bitten into her flesh, chewed and digested my girlfriend...
I can't get the image out of my head nor the words. 'She's dead, you're next'
'She's dead, you're next'
'She's dead, you're next'.
I can't get it out my head the image! I'm writing it on the walls in blood, She's dead, you're next'. '
She's dead, you're next'

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.
One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.
