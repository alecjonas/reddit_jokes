Soon the company was producing the very best cams in the industry. These are the spring-loaded ""camming"" devices that climbers jam into cracks in the cliff face to protect them if they fall.

Like their competitors, the company made cams in the standard sizes from 0.1"" wide all the up to 7.5"" wide, incrementing by 0.25"" or 0.5"" at each size.

Even though the company's cams were the very best, their biggest rival was killing them online, selling 5 or 6x more product than them every day. This was an embarrassment to the founder, whose background, after all, was in tech. So, he began to interview design agencies to rebuild their e-commerce website, but he kept cutting the interviews short, flustered by the designer's ignorance of climbing equipment.

When he started the company, his first hire was another silicon valley veteran, the German-born marketing genius, Karen Indstranger. So, he brought Karen into his office to complain about the interviewees: ""None of these agencies understand climbing! When I ask them how they would structure the database for our cams, they keep recommending decimal point data types. All I hear is 'float' this and 'float' that! In our shopping cart there should be no decimal points in cam sizes. Climbing is a world sport. We use millimeters! Why does no one do their homework?!""

Karen, knowing her boss was getting snagged on a technicality, offered to sit in on the next interview to see if she could smooth things over.

It just so happened that the next candidate, Jean Dupont, was a solo designer, not a full agency, but he happened to be new to California from France, and Karen took a liking to the idea of another European in the office. Jean's English wasn't perfect, but his technical knowledge was excellent.

Then came the critical question. The CEO asked, ""In a database, what data-type would you use for our cams?"" Jean had never been climbing, but he knew enough to know that cams could be quite small. Quick on his feet, he estimated that using the American standard of inches, he would need to use decimal points, and he started to open his mouth.

Right at that moment, under the table, Karen grabbed Jean's thigh and firmly squeezed. Understanding her grip to be a warning of caution, Jean paused, and instead of answering, asked a follow-up question. ""Please explain. How do you measure the cams?"" When the CEO explained that they sized their cams in millimeters, Jean realized how close he had come to a significant error. ""Int,"" he said, ""The sizes should be integers.""

The CEO was so pleased with this answer, he hired Jean on the spot. As Jean left the building he stopped by Karen's office to express his gratitude. ""Thank you, . . ."" \[ glancing to her nameplate \] ""K. Indstranger, for . . ."" \[ and gesturing the action as his English stumbled a bit \] "". . . leg hold!""

""You're welcome,"" Karen replied. ""The choke is always in the cam Ints.""","Long, and inspired by another front-page joke, but original. Enjoy!",3

Soon the company was producing the very best cams in the industry. These are the spring-loaded ""camming"" devices that climbers jam into cracks in the cliff face to protect them if they fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Like their competitors, the company made cams in the standard sizes from 0.1"" wide all the up to 7.5"" wide, incrementing by 0.25"" or 0.5"" at each size.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though the company's cams were the very best, their biggest rival was killing them online, selling 5 or 6x more product than them every day. This was an embarrassment to the founder, whose background, after all, was in tech. So, he began to interview website design agencies to rebuild their e-commerce website, but he kept cutting the interviews short, flustered by the designer's ignorance of climbing equipment.

&amp;#x200B;

When he started the company, his first hire was another silicon valley veteran, the German-born marketing genius, Karen Indstranger. So, he brought Karen, his VP of Marketing, into his office to complain about the interviewees: ""None of these agencies understand climbing! When I ask them how they would structure the database for our cams, they keep recommending decimal point data types. All I hear is 'float' this and 'float' that! In our shopping cart, there should be no decimal points in cam sizes. Climbing is a world sport. We use millimeters! Why does no one do their homework?!""

&amp;#x200B;

Karen, knowing her boss was getting snagged on a technicality, offered to sit in on the next interview to see if she could smooth things over.

&amp;#x200B;

It just so happened that the next candidate, Jean Dupont, was a solo designer, not a full agency, but he happened to be new to California from France, and Karen took a liking to the idea of another European in the office. Jean's English wasn't perfect, but his technical knowledge was excellent.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the critical question. The CEO asked, ""In a database, what data-type would you use for our cams?"" Jean had never been climbing, but he knew enough to know that cams could be quite small. Quick on his feet, he estimated that using the American standard of inches, he would need to use decimal points, and he started to open his mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

Right at that moment, under the table, Karen grabbed Jean's thigh and firmly squeezed. Understanding her grip to be a warning of caution, Jean paused, and instead of answering, asked a follow-up question. ""Please explain. How do you measure the cams?"" When the CEO explained that they sized their cams in millimeters, Jean realized how close he had come to a significant error. ""Int,"" he said, ""The sizes should be integers.""

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO was so pleased with this answer, he hired Jean on the spot. As Jean left the building he stopped by Karen's office to express his gratitude. ""Thank you, . . ."" \[ glancing to her nameplate \] ""K. Indstanger, for . . ."" \[ and gesturing the action as his English stumbled a bit \] "". . . leg hold!""

&amp;#x200B;

""You're welcome,"" Karen replied. ""The choke is always in the cam Ints.""","Climbing gear, data types, and a compassionate German VP",0

He walks into the shop and is surprised to find they are out of every flavor except vanilla. But he is so hot and exhausted it didn’t matter at this point, so he orders the largest size vanilla.

""Why yes we have, in fact, I'm in the top 1% in the world in shooting accuracy as I have never missed a shot at any range throughout the world, and trust me pal, I've been to plenty.""

Sweat drips down his forehead as he extends his arm and looks downrange. The target is about 50 feet away, Mac close his eyes, tightens his grip, and empties all 10 bullets without even opening his eyes, after the last shot, he drops the pistol and looks at the target. Of course, not a single bullet hit.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,62

After a terse discussion with the young lady as to why this was completely inappropriate, the mannequin was set back to the way the old man preferred.

For my fortieth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me.

Although I am still in great shape since playing football 24 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.

Called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Vanessa, who identified herself as a 26 year old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear.

My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started!  The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress 

**MONDAY:** 

Started my day at 6:00am.  Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Vanessa waiting for me.  She was something of a Greek goddess with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile.  Woo Hoo!!!!! 

Vanessa gave me a tour and showed me the machines.  She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill.  She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit.  Very inspiring, Vanessa was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around.  I enjoyed watching the skilful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today. 

This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!! 

**TUESDAY:** 

I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out of the door.  Vanessa made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it!  My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile.  Vanessa's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile.  I feel GREAT!!  It's a whole new life for me.

**WEDNESDAY:** 

The only way that I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it.  I believe I have a hernia in both breasts.  Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to steer or stop.  Vanessa was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members. 

Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying.  My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Vanessa put me on the stair monster.  Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators?

Vanessa told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life. 

She said some other sh#t too. 

**THURSDAY:** 

Vanessa was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl.  I couldn't help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. Vanessa took me to work out with dumbbells.  When she was not looking, I ran and hid in the men's room.  She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine.

**FRIDAY:** 

I hate that b#tch Vanessa more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world.  Stupid, skinny, anaemic little cheerleader.  If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it.  Vanessa wanted me to work on my triceps - I don't have any triceps!  And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the Barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich.  The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher.  Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?

**SATURDAY:** 

Vanessa left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today.  Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my fist.  However, I lacked the strength to even use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Shopping Channel.

**SUNDAY:** 

I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over.  I will also pray that next year, my wife (the b#tch), will choose a gift for me that is fun -- like a root canal or a vasectomy.",The Gym (at 40) - Try and read this without laughing out loud!,8

All of a sudden, they are confronted by a group of natives, who grab the trio and drag them to their little village and tie them to stakes, all the while shouting in their own language.

Eventually, a wizened, bent, ancient old white man comes out of one of the little mud huts. He approaches the trio and explains that a very long time ago, he was taken hostage by the tribe, but allowed to live as the sole survivor from a group of explorers. He learned their language and served as a translator for any white men foolish enough to cross them.

He explained that unfortunately, the men had accidentally walked over what the natives considered sacred ground; this was punishable by death. The method of death, was to be skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

However, the old man says, the tribe are a kind and generous people, who will give the condemned one final wish, that they are honour bound to fulfil.

The Englishman, ever brave, elects to die first. He asks that his final wish, as a red-blooded man, is to have one final night of wild passion with the most beautiful woman in the village.

The old man translates and the chief of the tribe goes away, and comes back with a very big, very ugly, very hairy woman. Clearly they had different standards of beauty. But, nonetheless, the Englishman is happy to go off with her and have one final night of passion. In the morning, he is skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

The Scotsman decides to go next. His wish is to get so blindly drunk he won’t even know that he’s being skinned. So the chief gives him a small cup of firewater. The strongest on the planet. The Scotsman drinks it and is immediately horrendously drunk. He stumbles about the village, singing, dancing, and generally causing mischief until morning comes, when he is skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

And finally, it’s the Irishman’s turn. When asked what his final wish is, he asks for a fork. The old man is confused, and asks again. The Irishman insists he just wants a plain old metal fork. So the old man translates and the chief brings him a fork. The Irishman is untied, and he stands in front of them for a moment, before wildly stabbing himself all over his body, screaming;

SK: He noticed that laffy taffy was only bringing joy to the younger customers so he developed a mint with a nice calming flavour and while it's dissolving in your mouth it tells you a joke.

Man: That actually sounds pretty nice, I haven't heard a decent joke in a while.

SK: Why don't I let you try a few to see what you think.

The man puts one in his mouth and starts to smile and by the end of the mint he is letting out a decent laugh.

Man: That wasn't half bad, may I try another?

SK: Be my guest.

Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answers, “That would be me.”

“Yes! Very good,” says the Queen.

“I’m not sure” says Cheney, perplexed. “let me get back to you on that one.”

Cheney goes to his advisors and asks everyone, but none can give him an answer. Finally, he ends up in the men’s room and recognizes Colin Powell’s shoes in the next stall. Cheney shouts “Colin! Can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it’s not your brother or your sister. Who is it?”

Colin Powell yells back, “That’s easy. It’s me!”

Cheney smiles, and says, “Thanks!” Then, Cheney goes back to speak with Bush. “Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle : it’s Colin Powell.”

Guy 2 : You are right, let's get to know each other.

Guy 1 : And another sign! I have a bottle of unopened fine whine in my car and it also is in perfect condition! Let's drink to our newfound friendship!

So the man goes to get the bottle in his car, opens it and hands it to the second man. The second man under the heat of recent events, takes a few big gulps and hands the bottle back. The first man however, refuses the bottle. The second man is surprised.

What the fish didn't know was that there was a bear waiting at the edge of the river, watching the fish watching the fly.

What the bear didn't know was that there was a hunter sitting in a tree nearby, eating a sandwich, watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly. The hunter thought to himself, ""Man, if that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump up and catch it. The bear will catch the fish. I'll shoot that bear and have myself a fantastic meal."" What the hunter didn't know was that there was a mouse on the tree branch watching the hunter watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly.

The hunter dropped his sandwich, grabbed his rifle, and shot the bear. The mouse ran up to the sandwich and started chowing down.

However, they are greeted immediately by the hostess, who was very nice, and seated at a table fast. A waitress comes over and asks for their drink orders.

It was a bit of a celebration, so the priest orders wine for the rabbi and himself and a fountain beverage for the monk.

Once she leaves, they talk about how gross the whole place looks, but it seems to be very popular so the three of them just try to ignore it and begin to share some stories.

Eventually the monks stomach growls loudly. Then he noticed something a bit strange... they had no menus. He called the waitress over.

""Pardon me, miss, but could we maybe see a menu? We didn't get one.""

She replied, ""OH! I'm sorry, I shoulda known you fellas were new here. We don't actually use menus because we only serve one thing every night. Forgive me!""

""Oh, okay,"" He said ""well then will it be ready soon? I am rather hungry.""

""Of course! We start cooking 'em as soon as people walk in. We waste no time! Only a minute more, no worries.""

""Well great! What is it we're gonna be dining on tonight?""

""Human Brain Soup! It's seasoned with our special blend of spices and comes with a side of crackers. All together it is about five hundred dollars. Bon appétit!""

As she walks away, the three of them look at each other, completely wide-eyed and terrified. They hold their hands up to their faces to not be seen and begin whispering to each other.

He says to the lawyer ""Remember when I stashed away all that money in floorboards of Luigi's Pizza place?, let's go pay our old pal a visit and make a withdrawal, I wanna move the load someplace else""   


They arrive at Luigi's Pizza Parlour not long after closing time, Luigi, behind the counter, upon seeing the two of them looks like he'd just seen a ghost. 

  
MB: ""Hey there old friend, I got out early, whaddya know. I came to make a withdrawal"" he says with a big smile.   


Luigi stands there frozen in shock.   


MB: ""Hey Luigi, you heard what I said?"" his smile now fading away.  
 

Luigi stares with a blank expression, still.   


MB: ""Hey! Luigi! Snap out of it, I want my money back!"" he says snapping his fingers in Luigi's face.   


Luigi snaps back into reality and brings his hands from his sides to about chest height and makes a few vague gestures, but doesn't say a word.   


MB grabs Luigi by the collar of his shirt and pulls out a pistol, pointing it at Luigi's head, ""I'm not fucking around here Luigi""  


Lawyer: ""Calm down boss, clam down, Luigi what the fuck are you doing, where is the fucking money""   


Luigi gestures some complex movements with his hands.   


Lawyer: ""Boss I think Luigi went deaf!""   


MB: ""Fuck, Luigi I'm sorry, I didn't know"" he lets go of Luigi.   


Lawyer: ""Boss, I know a little bit of sign language, lemme talk to him""   


MB: ""Tell him I came back for my money""  


The lawyer and Luigi have a back and forth of intense sign language for a bit.   


MB: ""What the fuck is he saying"" clearly getting agitated again.   


MB cocks his gun, points it square at Luigi's head and says ""I'm done fucking playing games here Luigi""  


Luigi, distraught confesses to the lawyer he removed the money from the floorboards of his pizza parlour and buried them in his backyard at home not expecting the old Mafia Boss to get out prison years ahead of his scheduled release, he begs for forgiveness.

Jim finally went to see a doctor. After a lot of researching, the doctor said: ""I have good news, but I also have bad news.""  
  
The good news is that I have found a cure for your extreme headaches. The bad news is that your testicles put so much pressure on your spine, that it can cause extreme headaches.  
  
The only thing I can do is castrate you, to relieve your spine from the pressure."" Jim was shocked, and became depressed. He didn't know what to do. A life without sex was not very attractive, but he didn't like his life anyways with these headaches. He decided to castrate himself.  
  
When he walked out of the hospital without his testicles, and for the first time in twenty years wasn't plagued by the extreme headaches, he felt like a completely different person. To celebrate this, he decided to buy a new suit in an expensive store. When he walked in, he told an old seller that he was looking for a new suit. The seller told him: 'I see that youe need size 44.' Amazed looked Jim at the seller and said: ""How do you know?"" ""Oh sir, I've been in this business for 40 years, and I have a very good view on it.""  
  
Jim fitted the suit and looked in the mirror. The suit looked stunning on him. ""You of course need a nice shirt in combination with that suit"". The seller told him. Jim agreed. The seller said: ""You have size 34 from sleeves and 16 from neck."" ""I'm amazed how you can just see it without measuring"", said Jim.  
  
""Oh sir, it's really not that hard after 40 years"". Jim fitted the shirt, and it also stood great on him. ""While we're at it,"" said Jim, ""Why don't we go look for some new shoes?""  
  
The seller looked at him and said: ""Size 44, isn't it?"" Again was Jim amazed. After they chose the right shoes, the seller said to Jim: ""Of course you want new underwear too?""  
  
He looked at Jim's waist, and said: ""Size 36, right?"" Jim said a bit triumphant: ""Nope, this time you're wrong, I always wear size 34!""  
  
The seller shaked his head and said: ""You should 100% not do that. Size 34 is too tight for you, and pushes your testicles right against your spine, something that can cause extreme headaches!""","After years of being plagued by extreme headaches,",403

One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Ralph suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Ralph out. 

When the Head Nurse became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable. 

When she went to tell Edna the news she said, ""Edna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged; since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of another patient, I have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness. The bad news is, Ralph, the patient you saved, hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom. I am so sorry, but he's dead."" 

Edna replied ""He didn't hang himself. I put him there to dry. When do I get to go home?""",Ralph and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital.,35

A friend once introduced us  
I hardly even knew

The ties that seemed to bind us  
Imperceptively grew

Eventually my body ached  
I could only think your name

At 3am I lied awake

You pulled me from  
the ones I love  
To spend my time with you

And now you’re gone

The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, “What kind of car ya got there, sonny?”

The doctor replies, “A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!”

“That’s a lot of money,” says the old man. “Why does it cost so much?”

“Because this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!” states the doctor proudly.

The moped driver asks, “Mind if I take a look inside?”

“No problem,” replies the doctor.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.

Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, “That’s a pretty nice car, all right, but I’ll stick with my moped!”

Just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.

He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph.

Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror – what it could be…and suddenly…

WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH!

Something whips by him going much faster!

“What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?” the doctor asks himself.

He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 175 mph.

Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it’s the old man on the moped!

Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph.

WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH!

He’s feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN!

Astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 250 mph.

Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

The Ferrari is flat out, and there’s nothing he can do!

Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

The doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive.

He runs up to the mangled old man and says, “Oh my gosh! Is there anything I can do for you?”

The old man whispers, “Unhook my suspenders from your side mirror.”","A doctor goes out and buys the best car on the market, a brand new Ferrari GTO. It is also the most expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000. He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.",32048

So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with a low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for burglary.

Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds,  pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Wilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

""We're the Amazing Indestructible Duo,"" says the man. ""Watch!""

He and his wife each produce a suitcase from behind their backs. She opens hers, pulls a folding chair out of it, and places it for her husband to sit in, which he does.

Then she takes out the sledgehammer. This thing is huge. Professional-demolitions grade. She brandishes it before the talent scout. It's authentic. She flexes. She's got arms like ham hocks. It's looking good.

She walks to her husband, swings it back like a golf club, and smashes her husband in the face at about mach five. The chair gives way instantly. He flies forty feet across the room and hits the brick wall, fracturing it from ceiling to floor.

He lies limp on the ground for a moment, then springs to his feet, raising his arms in triumph and flashing a dazzling smile. He's entirely unharmed.

""TA-DA!""

The talent scout jumps to his feet and applauds the couple.

""Amazing. Just amazing. You're in.""

The husband and wife bow, pack her stuff up, and make their way out.

""Wait--just one thing,"" asks the scout. ""What's in the *your* suitcase?""
