I want a divorce right away ! And the husband replied, 'Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.

I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty.  


She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days.  


So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight.  


The poor thing devoured them in moments.  


Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away.  


Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.  


I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, whi ch you don't wear because I don't have good taste.  


I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.

An unworldly bloke had a stroke of good luck and won the lottery. Everyone told him he could have anything he wanted now, so what did he want? He had never been with a woman so he set out in his car, rolled down the window and said, “Hey, baby...want to have sex?” She yells, “Get lost creep!” He repeats this a few time with the same results. He decides on a different tactic. 

He takes out the money and spreads it all across the dash of his car and circles back around to the first woman and asks again, “Hey, baby...wanna have sex?” “Get lo....” she sees all that money so she hops in. He asks if they can have sex now but she says it’s not dark enough to drive down an alley, so he does. “Is it dark enough?” It wasn’t so she had him drive down farther until it was very dark. 

“Can we have sex now?” 

“Not yet but take my pants off and see what’s down there”. He takes her pants off but it’s too dark to see so he takes out his lighter and turns it on. While he’s doing this, she opens her purse and begins raking the money in it. 

“Boy, you sure do have a lot of hair down here!” She just mumbles uh-huh and keeps raking  the money in her purse. “Can you pee through all this hair??!” “Uh-huh” while finally getting all the money in her purse.

Mothers Mary, Agnes, and Isadore take it upon themselves to prepare the convent to receive His Holiness and plan a simple but delicious meal of fresh caught fish from the local lake with herbs and vegetables from their own garden.

Agnes goes to the local lake and casts her bait and within seconds she feels a mighty tug on the line.  She reels in a beautiful fish every color of the rainbow!  Surely this is a sign of god's grace and love, and it would be a perfect fish to serve to the Pope.  The trouble is Agnes nor any of the other nuns had ever seen such a fish before and had no idea what it was or how to prepare it so they put it on ice and took it to the local village which had many experienced fishermen.

When they entered a fishing shop with their catch they asked the shopkeeper what they had caught.  He removed his sunglasses and said ""Oh goodness that's very rare!  I haven't seen one in years.  This fish is called a Sunnavabitch and is absolutely beautiful when prepared correctly!""

They thanked the fisherman for his advice and sought the services of a local chef for his input on how to properly prepare the Sunnavabitch.  He said ""It must be treated gently!  Lightly steamed until the flesh is just tender.  This will make a fine meal for His Holiness!""

The following day Agnes left the fish with Mary and Isadore to begin cooking while she gathered fresh produce from around the Convent.  Mary took special care to clean and gut the fish, leaving not a single scale or bone.  Isadore took Agnes' herbs and vegetables and cooked them with the fish.  No sooner had the meal come together than they heard a knock on the door and it was the pope himself!  They graciously welcomed him in to their table and proudly placed the fish before him. 

They prayed and ate the meal as the Pope praised every bite, thanking God and the nuns for such incredible bounty.

When finished the Pope said ""This-a meal was-a so good!  But I have-a never had such a fish in-a all of my days.  Who made-a this?""

Wanting to speak properly Agnes stepped forward and said ""Well your Holiness, I caught the Sunnavabitch, Mary cleaned the Sunnavabitch an Isadore cooked the Sunnavabitch.  We are grateful it was to your liking""

The pope nodded knowingly to the three nuns and sat back in his chair and said ""You know, you fuckers are all right""",A convent of Catholic nuns receives a letter saying the Pope himself will be visiting in just a few days,16

They arrive by water plane, and the pilot informs them that he’ll be returning to pick them up the next day. The men, happy to finally be alone start sunbathing, talking about their lives (most of the talk being complaints), and simply having a good time.

One of the guys decides, he wants to build a sandcastle, because, why the hell not. He starts digging up some sand, and asks his best friends to help him out. They start digging, and finally, one of them exclaims: “Guys! look! Its a lamp!” The guys looked at each other and instantly knew what to do: all three of them simultaneously gave the lamp three rubs.

Suddenly *poof* a genie came out of the bottle! The three guys felt like this trip just couldn’t get any better. 

The genie, in the most Will Smith voice possible says: “you three, you have freed me! I shall give each one of you three wishes as a sign of my gratitude!”

The first guy instantly responds: “i want health for myself, and my entire family.” And the genie grants his wish.

The second guy responds: “i want the same thing, seems like a good idea. However, if you could add upon that that all current illnesses, genetic or otherwise would disappear, it would be great.” The genie replies “yeahhh sure” and *poof* his wish is granted

The third guy said he needed a while to think. After about 30 minutes, he exclaimed: “ive got it! I want my right hand to spin clockwise until I die!” The genie, dumbfounded, asks “are you sure?” And the third man simply said “yes, 100%” and his wish was granted.

The first guy then said  “its my turn again! I want to be wealthy enough to buy anything i’d ever want, and i want to see proof of it.” The genie granted his wish and *poof* a phone appeared in his hand showing the first guy’s bank statement. $10 Billion dollars have been deposited on his bank account.

The second guy, agreeing to his logic, said “i also want money. But i’d rather have it in physical goods, like houses, or gold bars” *poof* another phone appears showing a page with all the real estate and investments that the second guy now owned, all worth around 10 billion dollars too.

The third guy, having thought about this thoroughly throughout the last few minutes, simply said “i would like my left hand to spin counter-clockwise until i die” the genie thinks to himself, this man MUST have a plan with all this. And simply grants his wish.

Back to the first guy. He now wished for him, and all his loved ones to be immortal, and to stay at the age of 35 until they decide, on their own terms, that its time for them to leave this planet. The genie, granted his wish just like all the other ones before him.

The second guy, who we now know is the least creative of the bunch mutters nothing else but “same”. And the genie grants his wish too.

The third guy however, was still thinking. His left and right hand spinning in opposite directions he shouted: “i want my head to rock back and forth as if i was on a rock concert until i die!” At this point the genie didn’t even care anymore and just said “aight man, whatever”.

The men, all happy with their wishes decided to meet up again in ten years to discuss their lives.

They met up in Monaco, one coming on his yacht, the second on his private jet, both with beautiful wives and kids, and sat down at a table in the most expensive restaurant in town.  The third guy then arrived, his hands still spinning and his head still rocking back and forth, almost knocking over the table. He apologised and they began talking about their lives. The first and second guy are so happy with their new lives that they have tears streaming down their cheeks. They talked about the wonderful houses theyve built, the investments theyve made, and the vacations theyve had. Suddenly they realised that the third guy hasnt said a word. They ask him, “what about you? Hows your life? How did your wishes work out for you?”

And he looks at them, a tear rolling down his eyelid and says “guys, i think i fucked up”","A friend told me this, and he might have got it from reddit so this might be a repost but here it goes [Long]",5

So the guy reaches into his bag and pulls out a miniature piano and a hamster. The hamster sits in front of the piano and starts playing. And not just banging out ""Chopsticks"", the hamster is plays Chopin, some ragtime, and even some rock and roll.

After a few minutes the bartender says, ""Okay, I am impressed. You can drink for free tonight.""

As the bartender is pouring the guy a drink, the guy says, ""Hey, if I show you something even more amazing, will you let me drink for free for a month?""

The bartender says, ""Okay, but this had better be pretty spectacular."" So the guy reaches into his bag again and pulls out a microphone and a frog. The frog sits in front of the microphone and begins singing along with the hamster playing the piano.

The bartender says, ""Okay, I'm impressed. You can drink here for free for a month.""

As all of this has been going on, another customer at the end of the bar has been watching. He walks over and says, ""I'm a theater producer, and I'd like to buy that frog and put him in a show. Will you sell it to me for $500?"" The guy says no. ""$1000?"". The guy still refuses. ""Okay, will you sell me the frog for $5000?""

So the guy agrees, and gives the producer the frog for $5000. As the producer is leaving, the bartender says to the guy, ""I can't believe you sold the frog! Surely it was worth more than $5000!""

""Not really."" The guy says. ""The hamster's a ventriloquist.""","A guy goes into a bar and says to the bartender, ""If I show you the most amazing thing you've ever seen, will you let me drink for free tonight?""",3633

A stockboy is stacking fruit on a display, when a lady asks ""Do you have any potatoes? ""
The stockboy replies ""Sorry ma'am, we are out of potatoes, but we will be getting a shipment tomorrow morning""
The lady looks around some more. A few mins later she runs back to him asking where the potatoes are.
The stockboy confused about her mental state simply tells her ""Sorry ma'am, we are out of potatoes, but we will be getting a shipment tomorrow morning""
The lady looks around some more then goes back to the same stockboy and asks ""Where the hell do you keep the potatoes, I need some potatoes right now!""
The stockboy, getting frustrated with his inability to explain the situation, tells the lady ""Answers a couple of questions and I will get you your potatoes from the back.""
The lady agrees and the man starts the questions.
""Spell cat for me, as in catastrophe "" she says Ok, ""C A T"". ""Very good!"" the stockboy says, ""now spell dog, as in dogmatic. ""
The lady getting frustrated spells it correct. Now the employee finally asks ""now spell, Fuck, as in potatoes. ""
She replies ""There is no Fuck in potatoes?""
To which the stockboy replies ""THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE TIME!""",No Potatoes,7

There was an island in the middle of the lake, which the kingdoms had been fighting over for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for fight.

The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of them busily preparing for battle. The second kingdom had 20 knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight with his lone squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor.

When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight, as this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in. The battle raged, and when the dust cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom. He had defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms.

This proves that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",of Knights and Squires,5

post,d2qtad,2qh72,jokes,false,1568211221,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d2qtad/the_adventures_of_farty_bart/,self.jokes,,"Bart was a regular fellow, quite charming actually. But he farted often than most.


Bart has obatined that sweet sweet yes from the girl of his dream, they agreed to a date on his now girlfriend's house.


They were eating, chatting, laughing, until he had the sudden urge to fart. Of course like any decent gentleman he chose not to embarrass himself and hold it in. But he failed and it came out almost instantly.


""Max, get out of here right now!"" His girlfriend said. Max was her dog that was sitting just beside their table.


Bart was relieved that she thought it was the dog that farted! Looks like he got away this time.

Now Max the obedient boy that he is, went straight under the table, girlfrien.. let's just call her Annie from now, just ignored him and continued on their date.


About 5 minutes have passed and Bart had the urge to fart again. He's not called Farty Bart for nothing.


This time it was one of those farts that are labeled ""silent but deadly"" Bart wanted to be sneaky and just let it out without a sound, praying Annie wouldn't notice.

Again, he failed.


Annie noticed the absurd smell immediately.


Again she said ""Max, get out of here i said!"" 

Again Max didn't bat an eye and just stayed there.


Bart, again relieved that he got away because of his now best friend Max, is... well about to fart again.


This fart was one of those ""big ones"" you know the one the you know is gonna be bad... like really bad


He tried to hold it in, his face began to turn red, he sweated a lot, he was like having this spiritual battle... with his fart.


And then alas, he failed.


The fart came out in all of it's glory, probably filling the whole room!

Now Annie was full of it, she couldn't stand it, Max had to go.

Annie stood up and said ""Max! If you don't get out of here right now you're gonna get shat on!""",The adventures of Farty Bart,3

The priest replies, ""My son, it's caused by loose living, consorting with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, contempt for your fellow man, sleeping around with prostitutes and lack of a bath.""

The drunk muttered in response, ""Well, I'll be damned"", then returned to his paper.

The priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized. ""I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?""

The kids perked up and all listened to what their teacher would say first. 


"" 'To be or not to be, that is the question' who said this?"" The teacher asked.


 Little Pham Lam Nguyen on the first row called out ""Shakespeare!""


""Good job, you don't have to come to school on monday."" Said the teacher.

""Okay, that's alright as well."" Said the teacher. 


""Who said the phrase 'I have a dream!'""


Little Fri sum Kat who was seated next to Pham was quick to yell out ""I believe it was Martin Luther King Junior!""


""Good job, you don't have to come to school on monday."" The teacher told her as well.


""No thank you, miss. I'm from China and with us Education means a lot in our raising as well. So I will be here on monday."" Said little Fri Sum Kat.


""Alright."" Said the teacher, before a voice was heard from the back of the classroom.

If you go these 24 hours without committing your deadly sins, you will be granted an extra 10 years of life on Earth and a direct ticket to Heaven. But, if you commit your deadly sins, you will immediately be sent back to the deepest circle of the hell.” The three men unanimously agreed and were sent back to Earth to begin their trial.

post,d2k7r8,2qh72,jokes,false,1568174107,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d2k7r8/shut_up/,self.jokes,,"A young bluebird was flying from tree to tree in the brisk autumn air when he heard his parents call. Upon arriving back to the nest they tell the young avian to prepare for the trip south.

The little bluebird stubbornly inquires why, to which papa bluebird replies with details of heavy and cold white snow, scarcity of food, and other general discomforts.

Relentless, the rebellious adolescent bird with blue feathers flew from the nest and tweeted back to his parents that he wanted to stay, and in fact was going to—no matter what.

So, that's what happened.

For the first couple of weeks the bluebird felt as free as....well, a bird, of course. Flying here-to-there, there-to-wherever his little bird eyes fancied. It wasn't long, though, until the first snowflakes began to pull down their cold aura onto the fields, trees, brooks, and hills....and, or course the little headstrong bluebird...

As the pocket-sized plumed pilot started to realize the gravity of his dilemma his wings froze in mid-flight.

He dropped like a stone from the sky.

*SPLatttt!

Right into the middle of a fresh, steaming, splattered heap of cow pucky.

Seconds later, the thawed tiny bird stuck his head out of the manure and began chirping and singing as happily and loudly as his little heart and lungs could muster.

It was at that moment a big ornery farm cat pounced over, scooped up the little bluebird, and promptly swallowed him whole.

Moral of the story:
-Being in a shitty situation isn't always as  bad as it seems—look at the  bright side.
-Not everyone who helps you out of a shitty situation is your friend.
-And, lastly, if you're up to your ears in shit,. but you're happy, keep your mouth shut.",Shut Up,5

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, “Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.”

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, “If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.”

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

“Father,” replied the son, “I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.”

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, “If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.”

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

“Father,” said the son to this, “I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.”

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. “A carton of pink ping pong balls?”

“A carton of pink ping pong balls,” the boy confirmed. 

“I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,” said the father, “but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.”

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

“Dear son,” said the father, “I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?”

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. “Please humour me, dear father.”

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

“Dearest father,” the son started, “I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.”

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

“Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.”

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

“Father,” the son said, “You've made me very happy yet again.”

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. “My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?”

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. “Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.”

The father held his son's hand tightly. “Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.”

“Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.”

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

“Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.”

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

“Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,” the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

“I—“ the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

“I— I—“

Then he died.","A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?'",8

try startling yourself.""
That same day the man went to the store and 
bought himself a starter pistol.

Unfortunately, like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.

Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter from the local Target:

Dear Mrs. Harris,

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people’s carts when they weren’t looking.
2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.
3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women’s restroom.
4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, ‘Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away’. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money.
5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.
6. August 14: Moved a ‘CAUTION - WET FLOOR’ sign to a carpeted area.
7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he’d invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.
8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, ‘Why can’t you people just leave me alone?’ EMTs were called.
9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.
10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.
11. October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while loudly humming the ‘ Mission Impossible’ theme.
12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his ‘Madonna look’ by using different sizes of funnels.
13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled ‘PICK ME! PICK ME!’
14. October 21: When an announcement came over the loudspeaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed ‘OH NO! IT’S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!’

And last, but not least:

   15. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile, then yelled very loudly, ‘Hey! There’s no toilet paper in here.’   
One of the clerks passed out.",The Retired Husband,409

I got it from a truck stop while driving through Virginia. After leaving for my trip I realized I had only packed three shirts. But I was actually going to be in Michigan for 5 nights. I figured I could maybe get two days out of a shirt, but I probably couldn’t get more than that, so I bought an extra shirt.

I had the shirt for several years after that. It wasn’t my favorite shirt, wasn’t terribly comfortable, and was usually last in my laundry rotation. I’d wear it when all my other shirts were dirty, or sometimes I’d just wear it to bed. It was white and it said “VIRGINIA” on it in red letters, or maybe orange.

I lost it a couple months back. I was at a music festival. Some blues band was playing. That was when I saw this lovely brunette leaning against a tree. Or maybe she was leaning against a fence. What she was leaning against is not important. I walked over and asked if she was there with anyone. Like me, she had intended to come alone and hopefully run into some friends. I told her I think she just did.

We went and checked out a few different acts, we went to a food truck for a bowl of noodles and some felafel. After that we were tired, and the wine we’d been drinking had caught up with us. It started raining after we ate, I told her I had a towel and an extra shirt for her back in my tent so we headed there.
When we got there...

""My wife screwed the mailman""

""My wife screwed my best friend""

""My wife screwed Ssgt Jones's wife""

This troubled the young Marine as he had a very beautiful wife who he was very in love with. 

So, a couple of days before he left, he decided to go to a sex shop to pick his wife up a dildo. Hoping that if she became lonely she would resort to the dildo instead of cheating. 

When he entered the store, he was greeted by an older man in his late 40s and explained his situation. The man told him he had just the thing to keep his wife from cheating. The old man walked to the back of the store and removed a dusty old box and removed the dildo inside. 

""This is called the Voodoo Dick."" The man explained, ""All you have to do is say 'Voodoo Dick' followed by whatever hole you want it to penetrate and the magic of the dildo will do the rest. To make it stop all you have to say is 'Voodoo Dick stop'.""

The young Marine decided that this was his best option and bought the voodoo dick from the store keeper. He then drove home and showed it to his wife and explained how it works. 

""Just say 'Voodoo Dick' followed by whatever hole you want it to fuck and the dildo will go to work""

His wife rolled her eyes and put the dildo away in the closet. Never expecting to touch it. 

4 months pass and the Marine's wife is beginning to get very lonely and misses her husband dearly. It was then that she remembered the gift that he had given her and decided to take it for a spin. She undressed and removed the dildo from the box and remembering what her husband said, recited:

""Voodoo dick, my pussy"" and the dildo went straight to work. 

After nearly 30 minutes and several orgasms, the wife decided she'd had enough and tried pulling the dildo out. However the more she resisted, the rougher it went. She did everything she could think of to try to remove the dildo. Finally in a panic, she ran to her car and and started to drive to the hospital in hopes that they could save her. 

The dildo just continued to work as she drove and due to her speeding and reckless driving caused by the unrelenting dildo, she was pulled over by a state trooper. 

The officer walked up to her car and saw that she was undressed and squirming uncontrollably and asked if she was alright.

The wife frantically explained the situation and told him all about her husband being deployed and the voodoo dick and how she couldn't get it out and that she was on her way to the hospital. 

The officer waited in disbelief as the wife explained her story and when she finished the officer simply rolled his eyes, shook his head and said,

""yeah, Voodoo Dick my ass""",Voodoo Dick [NSFW],82

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

**Trump**: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

**CIA**: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

**Trump**: The Democrats created them.

**CIA**: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

**Trump**: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

**CIA**: We can't do that.

**Trump**: Why is that?

**CIA**: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

**Trump**: I don't care.

**CIA**: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

**Trump**: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

**CIA**: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

**Trump**: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

**Pentagon**: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

**Pentagon**: We cannot do that either, sir.

**Trump**: Why not?

**CIA**: We are talking to them, sir.

**Trump**: What? Why?

**CIA**: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

**Trump**: Then let us invade Iraq again.

**CIA**: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

**Trump**: Why not the whole of Iraq?

**CIA**: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

**Trump**: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

**FBI**: We can't do that.

**Trump**: Why not?

**FBI**: Then our own population will become fearless.

**Trump**: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

**Border** patrol: You can't do that, sir.

**Trump**: Why not?

**Border** patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

**Trump**: I am banning H1B visas.

**USCIS**: You cannot do that.

**Trump**: Why?

**Chief of Staff**: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

**Trump** *(sweating profusely by now)*: What the hell should I do as President???

**CIA**: Enjoy the White House &amp; Air Force One, sir! We will take care of the rest!",Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President.,4

Many afternoons his father would come drunk and beat his wife and only son, John. John was traumatised by his father’s acts. Every day when he went to school he would cry. Everyday he thought himself that he will be a better mosquito than his father one day. 

He continued to attend school but told no one of the troubles at his home. He learned how to sew clothes and make hats after school as he had to generate his own income, seeing as his family was dysfunctional. He made a steady income with his job and supported himself financially through most of High School.

In his final year of High School he attended an ethics class. He made and sold most of the fancy suits that all of his classmates needed in the ethics class. This sudden burst in income meant he could also support his own weight at university.

Four years later he graduated from university with a degree in mosquito rights. He wears one of his own silk hats everyday.

One day on the street he bumped into the most beautiful mosquito he had ever seen. He stepped back, lifted his hat and with a respectful nod to her said,

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant.","In 1986, Peter Davies",18

**EURO-ENGLISH**

The European  Union commissioners  have announced  that agreement  has been reached to adopt English  as the preferred language for  European communications, rather than German,  which was the other  possibility.

As  part  of  the  negotiations,  the British government conceded that English spelling  had some  room for  improvement and  has accepted  a five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro  for short).

In  the  first  year,  ""s""  will  be  used  instead  of  the soft ""c"". Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy.  Also,  the
hard  ""c""  will  be  replaced  with  ""k"".  Not only will this klear up
konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik  enthusiasm in the sekond year,  when the troublesome ""ph"" will  be replaced by  ""f"". This will  make words like ""fotograf"" 20 per sent shorter.

In  the  third  year,  publik  akseptanse  of  the new spelling kan be expekted  to  reach  the  stage  where  more  komplikated  changes are possible. Governments  will enkorage  the removal  of double  letters, which have  always ben  a deterent  to akurate  speling. Also,  al wil agre  that  the  horible  mes  of  silent  ""e""s  in  the  languag   is disgrasful, and they would go.

By the fourth year, peopl wil  be reseptiv to steps such as  replasing ""th"" by z"" and ""w"" by "" v"".

During  ze  fifz  year,  ze  unesesary  ""o""  kan  be  dropd from vords kontaining ""ou"",   and similar changes  vud of kors  be aplid to  ozer kombinations of leters.
