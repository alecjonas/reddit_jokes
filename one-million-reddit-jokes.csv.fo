She begins to pull on the alien’s ears, giving herself multiple orgasms until the pleasure is so intense that she passes out.

What feels like hours later, the wife wakes up next to her husband in their bed at home. They look at each other and the husband asks “What did they do to you?”

The guy almost falls over from his frantic laughter as he walks out the door, and the pharmacist quickly nods his assistant to go after him.

Quickly, one of them takes out a used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's a bottom. Behind them there's a noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as a goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. 

The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it a day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of a long narrow road there comes a farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: ""hey have either of you seen a goat roaming around"". One of the hunters replies: ""Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from"". The farmer replies: ""that's impossible, I had her tied an anvil"".

post,axlncx,2qh72,jokes,false,1551795599,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/axlncx/the_policeman_the_hispanic/,self.jokes,,"It’s around the holiday season and Bob the policeman is scheduled to work. He decides to set up a speed trap at his favorite roadway in Arkansas.

It’s been a few hours and Bob hasn’t seen a single driver. Just then, suddenly a pickup truck flies past him doing well over double the speed limit! Bob springs into action; he flips his lights, pulls out, runs the truck down, and pulls him over.

Bob walks up to the window and sees a Hispanic man in the drivers seat.

“Sir, do you have any idea how fast you were going? Also where are you headed to?”

“I believe I was doing close to double the speed limit officer. And I’m headed to see me family.” replies the Hispanic man.

“License and registration please” says Bob.

“I do not have them” the Hispanic man admits.

At this point Bob comes to the conclusion that he is most likely dealing with an illegal immigrant. Albeit the holiday season, despite him not wanting to, Bob took an oath to uphold the law thus he is forced to call ICE. Upon arrival they immediately arrest the Hispanic man and he is deported the next day. Bob feels awful.

The next year Bob is once again scheduled to work around the holiday season and is posted at his favorite roadway. Within the first hour a pickup truck flies past him doing easily double the speed limit! Bob immediately turns on his lights, pulls the vehicle over and approaches the drivers window. Much to his surprise it is the same Hispanic man from the year before!

“Do you know why I pulled you over? Also where are you headed?” He asks.

The Hispanic man calmly answers. “I believe I was doing double the allowed limit. I am headed to see me family”

Bob is confused and a tad flustered at this point.

“Sir haven’t we met before? Same time last year? Same circumstances? Have you gotten your citizenship straightened out yet?” 

“Yes we have met before. Same time last year under the same circumstances indeed. No I am still not a citizen yet” replies the Hispanic man.

Bob sighs.
He proceeds to call ICE authorities and once more the Hispanic man is arrested and deported the next day. Bob is puzzled.

For the third year in a row Bob the policeman is scheduled to work around the holiday season. Per usual, he is sitting at his favorite roadway when his eyes behold an all too familiar sight. A pickup truck blows past him this time doing triple the allowed limit!
Bob sounds his siren, chases the vehicle down, and pulls it over. He runs up to the window only to see the same exact Hispanic man from both years prior!

Completely bewildered. “Sir this is the third year in a row around the same time of year, under the same circumstances! Surely by now you know I will be sitting here yet you still come through here speeding! If you would just do the speed limit you would be able to see your family in peace!” He exclaims.

“Well, if I don’t drive fast enough then I’m afraid I won’t be able to see them as it is not practical for me to purchase a plane ticket.” The Hispanic man explains.

“Sir, i am sorry but I must contact the authorities once again. I’m afraid you will be arrested and deported for the third year in a row. I hate to do this.” Bob says.

“No, no, it’s quite alright really.” Replies the Hispanic man.

Still very confused, Bob asks. “If you don’t mind my asking, where exactly is it that your family lives that you must drive so fast to get?”

The Hispanic man, with the straightest of faces, looks Bob the policeman dead in his eyes, and smoothly answers.

The joke starts off with a son asking his father ""what's the difference between theory and reality"". The father says, go ask your Mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his mother. She thinks about it for a few seconds and says, YES! of course I'd sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the boy goes back to his Father and says, ""Mom would would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". Then the Father tells his son to ask his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. She too thinks about it for a few seconds. ""Well he is old but he is still handsome and famous"". ""$1 million, is a lot of money"". ""Yes, I'd sleep with him for $1 million"". So the boy returns to his Father and says ""Yes, sis would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". ""But what has this got to do with answering my initial question""?

""Thank you for freeing me, as a sign of gratitude I shall grant each of you 3 wishes.""

The first man quickly speaks ""I wish I had a million dollars!"" the genie nods and the man gets his phone, checks his bank account and there's a million dollars sitting in it.

The second thinks longer and finally says ""I wish I was the richest man alive."" the genie nods, he checks his bank account and boom trillions of dollars, maybe more.

The third scratches his chin thinking long and hard, he clicks his fingers and says ""I wish my left arm moved in a circle clockwise for the rest of my life."" the genie nods once again and the man's arm begins to move in a clockwise rotation.

""That's your first set of wishes complete."" the genie reminds them.

The first man speaks again ""I wish I was married to the most beautiful woman in the world!"" the genie snaps his fingers and the most amazing, perfect woman appears from nowhere and wraps her arms around the first man.

The second man smirks and says ""I wish I had the natural charisma and charm to get any woman I like."" suddenly the man feels more confident, he looks more handsome, he flirts with the first man's wife and she even flirts back a little.

The third man smiles knowingly ""I wish my right arm moved counter clockwise for the rest of time."" and just like that, his right arm begins to rotate counter clockwise.

""Third and final wishes."" the genie reminds them all once more.

The first pipes up again ""I wish I was in perfect health for the rest of my life!"" the genie nods and the man's complexion looks better, his back stops hurting even the tickle in his throat disappears.

""I wish I was 25 years old forever."" the second man speaks, and his wish is granted and he loses a few wrinkles here and there, gets a more youthful glow.

Happy with their wishes, the two turn to the third man who is wearing the biggest, smuggest smile. ""I wish my head moved backwards and forwards forever."" With a 'poof' his head begins to move backward and forward. He smiles with glee.

The genie thanks the men, the men thank the genie and they all go on their separate ways.

Years later, they decide to meet again at a restaurant. The first man arrives first in a designer suit, his stunning wife under his arm. The second arrives looking even more glamorous and the two talk.

""My life couldn't be better."" The first says ""I invested the million I got and made even more money and invested that! Now I'm one of the richest men on earth, I haven't had a cold not even a runny nose for years and I'm married to the most beautiful woman who is also amazing in the sack."" He laughs with joy.

The second man chuckles ""Well I am the richest man on earth and I used that money to build charities, create companies, I feel happier that Im making a difference. I haven't aged a day, feel like I'm in my prime and I tell you, I think you're wife is pretty great in the sack too."" He says with a wink. 

Finally, the third man shows up. Left arm rotating clockwise, right rotating counter clockwise and head moving back and forth. He slowly reaches the other two and says. 

"" Guys, I think I fucked up. ""

A true Buddhist can always cry out the name of Buddha when he is most needed.


So the guy heads back home and immerses himself in Buddhism. It takes years of study but finally he feels that he has mastered Buddhism. He flies back to Tibet to meet with the Dalai Lama for verification that he has the universal truth.


On the way up the tall mountain he loses his footing and begins to plunge to the ground. Remembering what the Dalai Lama told him he cries out, ""Help me, Buddha."" A huge brown hand appears out of nowhere and catches him. The guy is very relieved and cries out, ""Thank God.""

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: 

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: 

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.' So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. 
She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - Has wives that love sex, have money and like beer.

-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.

-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?

-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.

-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?

-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.

-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?

-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.

One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.

-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.

-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.

-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.

-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.

The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.

-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?

-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.

-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?

-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.

-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?

-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

""Jimmy, what does purple flowers mean?"" Johnny asked.

Little Jimmy looked at Johnny in horror and said ""I'm not gonna be friends with someone who says stuff like that!"" and ran away from Johnny.

Johnny next asked the teacher ""Teacher, what does purple flowers mean?"" The teacher looks at Johnny, mortified, and says, ""I won't have kids saying that kind of language in my class. Go to the principal!""

Johnny heads to the principal's office and asked, ""Miss, what does purple flowers mean?"" The principal replies with, ""You are expelled, I won't have any students in my school speaking that kind of language!""

Johnny head to the bus stop, and once he gets on, he asks the bus driver, ""Mister, what does purple flowers mean?"" The bus driver pushes Johnny off the bus, and says, ""I won't have your cussing in my bus!""

Johnny walks all the way home, and after he gets there, he tells his parents he got expelled. His parents ask why, promising not to get too angry, and to let him off with a warning. ""Well, I asked the teacher what purple flowers means."" Johnny's mother faints from her son's foul language, and in anger, the father says, ""Get out, no son of mine will say such terrible things!""

Johnny heads to the homeless shelter, planning to ask the homeless people about you-know-what, but they were all passed out and drunk. He goes to the owner of the homeless shelter, who's standards were pretty low, and asked if he knew what purple flowers meant. The guy says no, but the old man who didn't give a shit about what people said might know. Then he tells Johnny to get the fuck out, because his language is a ""bad influence"" on the homeless people.

Johnny goes to the old man, and knocks on his door. A short, grumpy guy with little hair and a lot of beard answers the door. Johnny says ""Excuse me sir, do you know what purple flowers means?"" The man says no, but the old lady who lives in a house faraway might know. 

Johnny, who's lost everything at this point, decides to go to this old lady's house, which was quite a distance away from the town he grew up in. Taking nothing but his wit and the clothes on his back, he started his journey. He crossed deserts with scorching heat and freezing nights, oceans teeming with hostile life, grassy plains and jungles full of Savage natives, going the route told to him by the old geezer. He had to prove that he was worthy to the savages by chopping off the genitals of an endangered species of pink panther in the Amazon. He crossed the vast Atlantic in a raft made from old Gatorade bottles he found on the beach. During his time at sea he was attacked by a rare blue footed booby, which was inexplicably in the middle of the Atlantic. He lost his foot to the monsterous boobies. He went to Egypt, where he killed a 100 year old vampire with the ability to stop time. He nourished himself with nothing but sand and spit. He grew into his teens, and then his 20's, until he finally reached West City (which was in the east of Egypt) to the lady's house, which was the southern area of northern Cario. The lady's house was just in front of him.

Johnny, exhausted, limped across the road. He's so tired he doesn't notice the massive moving van coming directly at him. He has time to see the driver. It was Jimmy, his childhood friend, in a moving company's uniform. In his shirt pocket was a beautiful purple flower. It was the last sight Johnny would ever see. The blood that got smeared on the front of the van and in the road never went away.

Well, I think we can all learn a very valuable lesson from Johnny's demise; that is, look both ways before crossing the road.

 There's somethin there to grab
 
 So yer belly isn't flat no more
 I tell ya, I don't care
 So long as when I cuddle ya
 I can get my arms round dere
 
 I'm tellin ya the truth now
 I never tells ya lies
 I think its very sexy
 Dat you've got dimples on yer thighs
 
 I swear on me grannies grave
 From the moment that we met
 I thought you was as good as
 I was ever gonna get
 
 No matter what you look like
 I'll always love ya dear
 Now shut up while the hockey's on
 And get me a nudder beer.

post,ax6b4k,2qh72,jokes,false,1551700553,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ax6b4k/my_favourite_joke_dave/,self.jokes,,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",My favourite joke: Dave,86

One hour later, he has decided golf is not his thing, too boring, etc.  Again he gets lost. Can’t find anyone. A few minutes later, he sees the same girl, and asks her 
“ Sorry to bother you again. Im new here. I think I got lost, could you tell me where I am?”.... “ Sir, I told you before, you are one hole behind me.  Im on the 13th, you`re on the 12”..  “Thank you so much”...... 
A third time he gets lost, and he couldn’t believe his luck, when he sees the same girl, this time he was really embarrassed, but he didn’t have any option. He asks,, and she replies..” Im on the 17th . You`re one hole behind me, on the 16th”.......       

Finally he finishes his round and decides to go get a drink.  In the clubhouse, he sees the girl, goes up to her, and asks to buy her a drink, for helping him out. She accepted. After a few drinks, he asks her 

..” What do you do for a living?”.... “ I’d rather not tell. Its a little embarrassing. Every time I tell my line of work, people start laughing at me”..  “ Don’t worry, you can tell me, Im very respectful. I promise I wont laugh”... After pleading for a while, he finally convinces her to tell, what does she do ..... “ I work selling tampons”... He immediately fell to the floor laughing hysterically.    She said “ You idiot. You promised you wouldn’t laugh “..   “Im sorry, I couldn’t help it. I work selling toilet paper, Im still one hole behind you”","A guy wins the lottery. So he decides to live his life like rich people. What does rich people do ? They play golf, so he goes to a country club to play golf.",39

I’ll bet you $500 I can stand on this bar and pee into that bottle without spilling a drop.” The bartender thinks he can’t ever stand straight let alone pee straight and takes the bet. The guy gets up on the bar and starts peeing everywhere. All over the bar and bartender, not a drop going in the bottle. The bartender starts laughing and saying, “you owe me $500!” 
Climbing down the guy states, “that’s ok I just bet everyone over there $1000 that I could pee all over you and the bar and still make you laugh.”

The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers.

So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.""

Skeptical Woman: How about you start by guessing our names.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And that is exactly what I will do! However, uncovering the names of you three would be way too simple for Miss Catarina. One may say I overheard you addressing each other during a recent debate about coming in here.* (She says with a smirk)

The faces of the other two women were filled with amazement.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I will predict the names of your children and explain some history behind why it was chosen!*

Thinking that there could be no way that she would know, the skeptical woman agreed. Miss Catarina starts with the first two.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Princess, your name has to be Penelope!*

The first woman was stun while Penelope looked to her mom confused.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I see you are confused my child, but be no more. You would most likely recognize your name as Penny! It is short for Penelope! Do you know why your name is Penny? It’s because your mommy loves collecting money! All kinds of money! Old money, new money and even foreign money!*

She then moves to the second child.

* **Lillian**: *Yes! But everyone calls me Lilly!*

* **Miss Catarina**: *And I bet that is because your mommy loves flowers! All types of flowers! Wild flowers, house flowers and even exotic flower!*

The two women confirmed with excitement! But now the skeptical woman is concern.

* **Miss Catarina**: *It’s a pleasure meeting you, Lillian.*

Saving the best for last, she walks over to the third child.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And you my handsome Prince. Your name is the most fitting of all!* 

While feeling embarrassed, the skeptical woman cuts off Miss Catarina.

* **Skeptical Woman**: *I’ve had enough! My son and I do not want to hear what you have to say! We’re leaving!*

While looking at the sad little boy getting taken out the shop, Miss Catarina shouts to him.

* **Miss Catarina**: *You have a wonderful day, Richard!*

The pirate replies, ""Well, I was off sword-fightin' some other cap'n off shore, when he took advantage, and slice my hand off right at the wrist!""

The stranger is shocked, and seeing the eyepatch on the pirate's face, he asks, ""Could you tell me what happened to your eye then?""

The pirate ponders for a second, but then remembers, ""Well now, I believe i was a-gazin' out at the sky from the rear of my boat, when a seagull flew over me and did its business, landing on my eye."" 

""That's unfortunate,"" says the stranger, "" but how exactly did you lose your eye from some bird poop?""

post,awuv4v,2qh72,jokes,false,1551626197,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/awuv4v/the_brick/,self.jokes,,"Those askreddit threads reminded me of this old one.

A man is building a house out of bricks. When it's finished he walks inside and finds a random brick in the middle of a room on the floor. Thinking to himself: ""I know I used every last brick to build this house. I wonder where this brick came from?"" He calls into the house his partner who helped him build the house and shows him the brick. The other man shrugs, picks up the brick, opens a window and throws the brick out of the window! Just like that, the man couldn't believe it!

Across town, a bus was setting off on a long journey. On the bus was a man opening his book and settling in for the long journey ahead. After only a few minutes into the ride, a *yap yap yap* noise came from the seats behind him. The yapping continued until, fed up, the man jumped up and scowled over the seat to the woman behind him and her yapping dog. He bellows, ""Can you please quiet your dog!"" The woman returns his scowl with one of her own and says ""No! I will not silence my pet, it is a dog and I'm allowed to have it and dogs yap! Mind your own business!"" 

The man returns to his side of the seat and opens his window in hopes the fresh air helps calm him, and the sound of the wind drowns out the annoying yaps. *yap yap yap* 

The man lights up a cigar and begins to smoke. Taking long pulls and blowing the smoke making sure it's blown directly in the woman's direction.

He feels a tap on his shoulder. The woman from the seat behind him is standing over his seat and coughing, she says: ""put that out! It's making me and my dog cough!""

There are pens made of fine hard woods and precious metals inlaid with all kinds of gems. These pens are all handmade by artisans who have been in the business for generations.

But what really sets this shop apart is their ink master. Most people buy pens with black ink or blue ink or even red ink, mostly because they do not know the world of colors of ink available at this shop. These fine inks are carefully blended by this ink master, a prodigy among those with a sense for color. There are colors so deep you feel you could fall into them, so vibrant you'd think they were alive, and so bright you'd think they were on fire. Every color imaginable and some you can't even imagine are available here. 

However the ink master is rarely at the store, he travels the world sourcing ingredients for his magnificent inks. Velvet Red ink made from the shell of a Japanese beetle. Royal blue ink made from the petals of an African flower that only blooms once every four years. Making sure these ingredients are available for his customers keeps this whiz of ink away for months sometimes years at a time.

But while people come from all over the world to buy this artisan ink maker's products, very few ever actually think they'll get a chance to meet him.

Because nobody expects the Spanish ink whiz is in.
