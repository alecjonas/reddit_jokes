&amp;#x200B;

Students who don't know S.H.I.T. will be placed in 

DEPARTMENTAL EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION PROGRAMS ( D.E.E.P 

S.H.I.T. ). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P S.H.I.T. 

seriously will have to go to EDUCATIONAL ATTITUDE TRAINING 

( E.A.T. S.H.I.T. ). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. 

before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. 

anymore, as they are all full of S.H.I.T. already. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a 

job teaching others. We can add your name to our BASIC 

UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST ( B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T. ). For 

students who are intending to pursue a career in manage-

ment and consultancy, we will refer you to the department 

of MANAGERIAL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH EDUCATIONAL ( M.O.R.E. 

S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage 

M.O.R.E S.H.I.T.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have further questions, please direct them to our 

HEAD OF TEACHING SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING 

( H.O.T.S.H.I.T. )

Thank you, BOSS IN GENERAL SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TEACHING

She’s holding a heavy bag full of money. She insists to the teller that she will only meet with the bank president to open a new account.  “It’s a lot of money.” she explains.

After a few minutes the bank president invites her to his office, “I hear you would like to open an account.  One of our tellers would be happy to help you.” 

The little old lady replies, “I would rather deal solely with you. It is a lot of money.”  

The president responds, “Just how much money are we talking about?”  

The little old lady replies ""$75,000,"" and empties her bag out onto his desk.  

The president is fascinated,  ""Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. If I may ask, where did you get all this money?"" 

The little old lady replies rather sheepishly, ""Well you see, I make these peculiar little bets.""

The president asks ""Peculiar? What do you mean?""

The little old lady says stares intently at the president, ""For example, I will bet you $25,000 that one of your testicles is square shaped.""

A little chuckle escapes the president, ""That’s indeed a peculiar bet.  One you couldn’t possibly win.""

""So, does that mean you’ll accept my little wager?""

The president thinks it over and after a short pause, “I will. Ma’am, I accept.  I’m sorry. You will certainly lose.”

""Perhaps. I don’t always win these bets,” she replies. “Since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. as a witness?""

""That seems reasonable. I will see you then tomorrow at 10."" the president replies confidently.

That night, the president gets nervous about the bet. He stands naked in front of his mirror examining his testicles, turning from side to side, again and again. Finally satisfied there is absolutely no way one of his testicles is square he retires for the night.

The next morning, at precisely 10:00 a.m. the little old lady returns with her lawyer, “Well the time has come to settle our bet. Please drop your pants.”  The president nods in agreement and lowers his pants.  The little old lady peers closely at his testicles and then asks, “they look quite normal but may I feel them just to be sure?”

""I suppose,"" answers the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""

Just then he notices the lawyer is quietly banging his head against the wall.  He asks the little old lady, ""What’s the the matter with your lawyer, is he alright?""

The little old lady replies, ""Ignore him, he’s always such a sore loser. A week ago I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 a.m. on this day I would be fondling the Bank of Canada President’s balls.""",Little Old Lady and the Bank of Canada President,3

The other farmer says, ""yeah, I've got this great rooster, named randy; he'll service every chicken you've got. No problem""

well, Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it. so, he buys Randy. The farmer takes Randy home and sets him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk, ""Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to service here and you cost me a lot of money, and I'll need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun,"" the farmer said with a chuckle.

Randy seemed to understand, so the farmer points towards the hen house and Randy took off like a shot ~WHAM~ He nails every hen in there THREE or FOUR times and the farmer is just shocked. Randy runs out of the hen house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake ~WHAM~ he gets all the geese. Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with the cows. Randy is jumping on every animal the farmer owns.

The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the next day to find Randy dead as a doorknob in the middle of the yard. Buzzards are circling overhead.

The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal, shakes his head and says, ""Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself."" Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and says, ""Shhh.

He shakes his hands and realises that they are now free.

""Approach the guard"" - The strange voice continued.  

The guy, visibly scared, obediently approaches the guard.

""Do not be afraid! The guard is asleep."" - Said the voice - ""Now, take the guard's tomahawk and strike him! He is the chieftain's son!""

He takes the tomahawk and kills the guard.

The voice chuckles a bit:

""Haha, NOW you're fucked!""

The pope is aghast! ""I can't just go changing God's word for money!""

The pope in unimpressed: ""Look, I told you. I just can't do it. I'm sorry.""

The guy is back a week later: ""Final offer- $500 million. Take it or leave it.""

He felt sad for the old man and pulled over, and went to ask what was wrong. ""Well I don't know, but everything is broken except my blinkers."" The guy felt bad for the old man and offered to tow the car out. Afterall he had one of the most powerful cars.

""Thank you, but I am old man and need to pull over many times for toilet while driving, and I am not sure what to do if the car brakes down even more while towing."" The guy was puzzled but got an idea. ""Well I will be watching you from the mirrors. If you need to go to the toilet, use the left blinker. If there is something wrong with the car, just use the right one.""

The old man agreed and off they went. After a while a Porsche passed them very fast. Having the Ferrari the guy got furious and without thinking floored it ans started to chase the Porsche while towing the old man and Lada behind. At the same time, the old man started to grow an urgent need for a toilet stop, so he put on the blinker to the left. The guy driving the Ferrari did not notice this and kept on pressing for the Porsche.

Just as the guy was on the start of the long straight and about to start to pass the Porsche they ran to police radar tailing each other.

The police handling the radar scattered for police radio and yelled to the radio: ""You won't believe what I saw!"" 
And an answer from radio: ""What now?""
""There's a Porsche and Ferrari heading your way driving 162 mph!""
""So what? Thats the daily routine for us with these sports cars.""
""Well yeah, but this is the first time that a Lada is following them and even signalling for a pass!""

If the Rabbi loses, he must leave Rome. If he wins, they can stay.

However, the Rabbi doesn't speak Italian or Latin and the Pope doesn't speak Hebrew or Yiddish. So they agree to have the debate using only symbols and hand gestures. The Pope goes first. He holds up three fingers. The Rabbi holds up one finger. The Pope makes a circular motion with his hand above his head. The Rabbi points to the ground. Then the Pope takes out a bottle of wine and communion wafers. The Rabbi pulls out an apple.

At this, the Pope holds up his hands and says, ""That's it. He is far too smart for me. The Rabbi wins, the Jews can stay.""

That evening, the Pope discusses what happened with his advisers. ""First, I held up the symbol for the Trinity. Then he held up one finger, meaning there is only one God. Then I told him God is everywhere, and he said God is right here. Then I pulled out the sacrament to show that there is salvation, and he pulled out an apple, meaning that there will always be original sin. He's far too smart.""

Meanwhile the Jews are having a party and one of the Rabbi's congregants comes to him and asks how the debate went.

""Can you believe the chutzpah on this guy? He tells me, 'You've got three days to leave Rome.' I give him the finger. He then says, 'Not only do you have to leave Rome, you have to leave all of Italy.' I tell him we're staying right here. Then for some reason he pulled out his lunch so I took out mine.""",A rabbi and the Pope have a religious debate,11

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

Soon, he notices that the thumping noise is getting louder..

""thump.. thump.. thump..""

He quickens his pace slightly and feels a tinge of anxiety. As he begins to walk faster he hears the thumping get louder and more rapid..

""Thump.. Thump.. Thump..""

The man now breaks into a jog and decides to look behind him. His face goes white as he sees what's been following him. A casket is hopping it's way down the sidewalk and steadily gaining on the man. Terrified, he bolts into a frantic run.

""THUMP THUMP THUMP""

He arrives at his house and darts into his front door locking it behind him. A few seconds later the door bursts into splinters and the casket crashes into his house as it continues it's pursuit.

The man screams in terror and dashes up the stairs, but the casket continues to follow him. He scrambles into his bathroom and locks the door behind him. He cowers in the corner as he hears the casket coming for him.

""THUMP THUMP THUMP""

The casket crashes through the bathroom door and starts hopping toward the man once again. Terrified, the man shreiks and reaches all around him for something to defend himself. He fumbles around and grabs the first thing he finds. In a maddened frenzy, he picks up a bottle of cough syrup and hurls it at the casket with all of his might.

Old Bill goes over to the guy anyway and says, “What’ll it take to get you to move that pile of small rocks from here to over there?”

“About $10 dollars per stone.”  The guy responds.
At this Old Bill gets nervous and tries to get a quick count of the pile of stones.  He sees there are fewer than 50 stones.

“Alright, its a deal.”

The guy picks up a stone, announces “10” and moves it to the new pile, then picks up another, announces “20” and so on until he gets to “470” with the final stone.  “That’ll be $470 dollars.”

“Alright, well I bet those guys over there $1000 that I could get you to move those rocks, let me collect from them and I’ll give you your cut.”

“Hold on,” the guy says, “I don’t care about any bet, you owe me 470 dollars.”

They get up early Sunday morning, load up their clubs, and drive the hour and half to the remote location. On the first tee, they are astounded to see multi-million dollar homes lining the course, the rising sun catching stained plate glass windows in a glittery display of decadence.

The husband leans to his wife and says ""Love, please, play it safe and don't hit any of these homes. We can't afford to replace one of those windows if we break one!""

Nodding, his wife agrees, tees up, and smacks the ball mightily. With an ominous ""woosh"", they watch in growing terror as the ball slices right, making a beeline for the biggest house's most prominent window. The ensuing tinkling of glass confirmed all they needed to know: the window was broken.

Rushing over, the couple was frantically trying to figure out how to make amends. They arrive on the doorstep of the home and ring the bell. They hear a slight curse and the front door opens to show a man in a robe, behind him, the young woman's ball lying in the middle of a shattered vase.

The husband began talking fast. ""Sir, I am so sorry about your window and vase. My wife and I don't have a lot of money though, so we cannot pay you for them. Please, is there anything else we can do for you?""

The man looked bewildered, looking from behind him to the young couple on his stoop.

""Young man, you've freed me! I am a genie, and have been trapped in that vase for two full millenia! It is I who should repay you! I will grant you and your wife one wish each.""

Not believing their luck, the husband and wife agree to wish for wealth and fame unending. The genie folds his arms and nods smartly.

""Now, before you go, I have to ask a favor. I have not known the touch of a woman for over two millenia. I would like to bed your wife.""

Flustered, the husband and wife look at each other and agree that the genie, should know the touch of a woman after so long, and so the wife goes upstairs with the genie.

After they finish, the genie lights up a cigarette, puffs on it, and looks at the wife. ""How old are you, lady?""

""I'm 26!""

""And your husband?""

""He's 24.""

Off course, he didn't bring a car and so the German government seizes the opportunity to impress him with German engineering. They lend him the most powerful car they have available, with a German driver/bodyguard. And off they go!

After a while the Pope ask the drive to pullover:

\- Young man, could you please drive along the smaller roads? I wanted to see more of the country, not the highway.

\- But your Holiness, this is the most efficient route.

\-Yes, but I don't want to take it.

\-Why not, your Holiness?

\- Like I said, because I ... Oh just get out I'll drive.

Now that he's driving himself and wherever he wants, the Pope is having a blast. The driver, who's now in the backseat, is somewhat disgruntled but resigns to his fate and enjoys the view. Near the Austrian border, road works lead the Pope back on the highway. And on this splendid highway, in this amazingly powerful car, the Pope starts to feel the need for speed. But that would be sinful. No no no he can't give in. At this moment, the driver pitches in 'Your Holiness, there are no speed limits on German highways'. Hearing this, the Pope unleashes his long dormant powers of a race pilot and floors it. The car almost leaps with enthusiasm that it can finally show what it can really do. As if by divine intervention all the cars in front of them give way and the car reaches its speed limit, just as it crosses the border with Austria.

Within minutes the car is swarmed with police and first responders, tv helicopters are starting to circle. Seeing this Pandemonium, the Pope thinks that his free time has come to an end and pulls over. Several police officers hastily walk over to the driver’s door. The Pope lowers his window and looks up to them with a faint smile. Suddenly the police officers feel very much out of their depth and decide to call the Chief of Police:

\- Sir, a German car crossed the border at more than twice the speed limit and now we are not sure how to handle it.

\- What do you mean, you are not sure? Apprehend it!

\- Yes sir. We got the car sir. But it's seems to belong to someone very important.

\- Oh. Yes, that might complicate it. Is it a congressman?

\- No sir, much higher.

\- Higher? What did you apprehend Angela Merkel?

\-No, sir. We think still higher, sir.

\-Higher?! Bloody hell do you think it's God perhaps?

\- Well sir, the Pope is driving him.

She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes.""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, 

""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes. Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

&amp;#x200B;

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, and women will flock to him"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM!!! she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

&amp;#x200B;

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

So, KAZAM!!! she's the richest woman in the world!

&amp;#x200B;

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""

**Moral of the story**: *Women are clever. Don't mess with them.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Attention female readers :** 

This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.

“About: The Alphabet race is a relay race hosted by Alphabet Inc. to help spread awareness of obesity in companies. You will be competing against other companies. The race requires 26 members per company. If you want your company to join, gather 26 of your co-workers, and, hence its name, make sure one of them has a first name starting with A, the other B, C, and so on. If their name is a name like “Mary Jane” or “Julio Xote España Cortez Juan Domingo Lorenzo Torres”, choose their first name. Nicknames of your office workers do not count. Yes, you can employ more people in order to meet the alphabet rule. The relay race is 1040 kilometers, which means that each person will have to walk 40 kilometers, A to B, B to C, and so on, until Y reaches Z. You can register your company to this race until July 3, 8:00 PM EST. Refreshments will be given, and 2 bottles of water will be given to each racer, and you can bring more. For more details, rules, clarifications, and Registration, reply back to this email. Hope you can join!""

\-*Larry Page, CEO, and Sergey Brin, President of Alphabet Inc.*

Robert was absolutely delighted that this came into his inbox. Persuaded by his wife, he finally turned vegan last week, and now that he's shedding weight, (You can get careless and let go during your midlife-crisis, Robert thought.) he can lose weight with his ***~~underlings~~*** coworkers too!

The next day, Robert printed the email and added ""If you are interested, gather at Meeting room 2B tomorrow at lunchtime."", and put it on the bulletin board. To his surprise, 50 people came, crowding around the room. After some short confusion, Robert announced that he will hold a short race, 50 rounds around the block, tomorrow. The next day, after racing (Robert ran with all his might, and he won fair and square) and declaring the winners, Robert emailed back to Larry and Sergey.

On the day of the race, Robert met up with his racers and gathered around the venue. (He considered himself lucky that he had a Xander, Yana, and an Ursula.) But when 20 minutes drew near, and Tina (Guess who she is supposed to be?) wasn't there, Robert worried that they would get disqualified, so he called her.

As it turned out, Tina's car broke down, so she carpooled. However, Tina said she might not make it due to the traffic in her area. Thankfully, Robert had a backup racer, and it was just a 10 minute drive from the backup, Tony, to here. He dialed Tony, and his phone answered on the third ring.

""Tony, remember when i told you to standby?""

""Yeah?""

""Well, now's your time.""

""Oh boy! Thanks. I'm going there right now.""

\*click\*

Satisfied, Robert went to the bathroom. However, when Robert came back, he discovered that while he was gone, Tina came, and the problem is, Tony already registered. When Tony came back with a number stuck to his chest, Tina burst in flames.

""Why the hell are you here? I'm the one supposed to be racing!""

""You were late, so i filled you in.""

""The race hasn't even started! Go back there and, like, unregister or something.""

""But i want to race! I wanna be a racer!""

""Okay, I'LL BE T RACER.""

While there, the Polish president asked Bush for a favor. Looking to help an ally, Bush asked what he needed.

""Well, you see in Poland we are having a serious crisis of morale,"" he began. ""You see, my people are unfairly accused of being stupid. We are constantly the punchline of jokes, and my people grow weary of the embarrassment.""

""How can I help?"" Bush asked.

""If you could arrange to do something stupid over in America. I mean really stupid. It would take the pressure off of my people and help us get a break from the constant ridicule.""

""I can do stupid. No problem."" said Bush. 

So president Bush went home and commissioned a huge building project. A MASSIVE suspension bridge in the middle of the Mojave desert. It was the biggest in the world. Only, it wasn't connected to any roads, and it didn't cross over any rivers or canyons. There wan't any water for miles. It went from nowhere to nowhere, over nothing. 

As expected, the bridge was a national disgrace. The US was a laughingstock. ""A bridge in the desert"" was an international punchline. Every late night show lampooned the ridiculous bridge. The ridicule continued for years. 

Then, in 2010, the newly elected president of Poland met with then president Obama at another NATO summit. 

""Mr. Obama, the people of my country thank you. Our morale has been restored. We are back on our feet and have our friends in America to thank for that. You can tear down that bridge any time you want. We are good."" 

""I would love to tear it down."" said Obama. ""The problem is there's a bunch of Polish guys fishing on it.""

Little Johnny then got peeved so he asked Mrs. Smith,

“Mrs. Smith, if there are 3 women on a park bench eating ice cream, one from a cup, one licking hers, and the other sucking on hers, which one is married?”

Mrs. Smith being a conservative older lady, was taken aback. 

She meekly replies,

“I suppose the third...”

Little Johnny smirks and replies,

“No, the one with the wedding band on her finger, but I like the way you think!”

The thunderstorm left three crew members on an unknown island. Later they found each other and together they encountered a strange tribe.

The native people of the island began to surround the three crew members and were ready to attack.

The chief comes out and states, ""Who are you and what have you come here for.""

Survivor A says, ""We were sailing and got caught in a storm and were stranded here.""

The chief replied, ""Since we are do not permit foreign people we shall kill you, but if you are to join as one of us, you will go out in our island and pick 10 fruits each by noon.""

The survivors agree and begin to head out to find fruits.

Survivor A returns early with 10 freshly picked apples.

The Chief says, ""As a tradition of our people, you must stick all 10 fruits up your ass without emotion to survive this test. If you fail, we will kill you.""

Survivor A begins with half an apple, but fails to keep going and is killed.

Survivor B arrived with 10 grapes and is told the same directions as survivor A. As survivor B continues to stick grape after grape, he emotionlessly sticks 9 grapes in. However, he suddenly bursts out in laughter and is slaughtered on the spot.

He finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. He felt very badly and apologized to the men for being late. He went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. Not knowing what else to do, he started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. He played out his heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. He played like he’d never played before for this homeless man. And as he played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, he wept, they all wept together.

When he finished, he packed up his bagpipes and started for his car. Though his head hung low, his heart was full. As he opened the door to his car, he heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

When he gets to heaven Saint Peter is waiting for him at the pearly gates.  
Peter says: ""Oh a Senator huh? Well we have a special deal for you! Since you spent your life trying to reach across the aisle to both parties we give you 24 hours in both heaven and hell and at the end of 48 hours you get to decide where you want to spend eternity.""  
   
The senator looks a bit bewildered and says ""why can't I just go into heaven?""  
Peter replies:""sorry rules are rules, where do you want to go first?""  
The senator replies:""let's get the hard part out of the way first. I'll go to hell to begin with.""  
Peter points to an elevator: ""press the button and go all the way down.""  
The senator walks over presses the button and starts heading down. Going down nothing changes everything seems the same as when he got in and when he hits the bottom it opens up to reveal a sandals resort-esque layout.  
As soon as he walks out a woman clad in a bikini gives him a mojito and he is greeted by three of his old friends. They walk over to a golf course and have a grand time catching up and talking.  
Then the devil walks up. Except no horns, nor hoofs, but rather a white linen suit. He smiles and starts cracking jokes and the Senator has a blast.   
At the end of 24 hours he gets back in the elevator and goes back up to the pearly gates.  
Peter greets him and asks: ""how was it?""  
The Senator responds ""amazing!""  
Peter raises an eyebrow quizzically and then directs him to the entrance of heaven.  
The Senator goes in and enjoys chilling on cloud furniture relaxing and enjoying himself but he is lonely and it just isn't the same without his friends.  
So at the end of the 48 hours he goes back to Peter. Peter asks him: ""have you made up your mind?   
The Senator replies: ""I have. Never thought I would say this in my entire life, but I would like to go to hell.""  
Peter looks at him aghast. ""Are you sure? Because once you make the choice it is irrevocable.""  
The Senator replies ""yes i'm sure.""  
Peter again points to the elevator and replies: ""May God have mercy on you.""  
The Senator goes and gets into the elevator. This time as it goes down it starts getting warmer to the point where the elevator feels like a furnace.  
The elevator stops and opens, but this time it’s different.  
The Senator sees fire and caverns with devils chasing people with pitchforks and everything is well...hell.  
He walks up to the devil who this time has horns, hoofs, and wings.  


He says “When I came here the other day it was like a tropical beach resort, now it’s well hell. What happened??”  
The devil looks at him and says smiling: “well you see the other day we were campaigning, but today you voted.” ",A US senator died and went to heaven.,250

The auditor said, “Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.”

“I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Grandpa. “How about a demonstration?

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, “OK. Go ahead.”

Grandpa says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.”

The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.”

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.”

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

“Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again. Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

“Are you OK?” the auditor asks.

“Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”

The young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers. Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied: “I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”

“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”

The little girl replied, “I will if those lazy assholes from Lowe’s ever deliver the goddamn drywall.” ",Blue Collar Joke,24954

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.""
