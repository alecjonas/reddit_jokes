""Logic?"" Jim says. ""What's that?""

The dean says, ""I'll give you an example. Do you own a whipper snipper?""

""Yeah.""

""Then logically speaking, because you own a whipper snipper, I  think that you would have a yard.""

""And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family.""

Finally he was brought to an old physician, who stated that he could figure it out.

After about an hour’s examination he came out and told the cardinals that he knew what was wrong. He said that the bad news was that it was a rare disorder of the testicles. He said that the goods news was that all the pope had to do to be cured was to have sex.

Well, this was not good news to the cardinals, who argued about it at length. Finally they went to the pope with the doctor and explained the situation. After some thought,the pope stated, “I agree but under four conditions.”

The cardinals were amazed and there arose quite an uproar. Over all of the noise there arose a single voice that asked, “And what are the four conditions?”

The room stilled. There was a long pause. The pope replied, “First the girl must be blind, so that she cannot see with whom she is having sex.

“Second, she must be deaf, so that she cannot hear with whom she is having sex.

“And third she must be dumb so that if somehow she figures out with who she is having sex, she can tell no one.”

After another long pause a voice arose and asked, “And the fourth condition?”

The pope smiled and replied, “She gotta have big tits.”",The pope had become very ill and was taken to many doctors,36

And that was perfect for Oskar, the burly Russian guide. He had been working as an outfitter and helping stragglers cross the treacherous mountains for years at this point. He knew the mountains like the back of his hand. While his English may not have been perfect, he was smart, loyal, and capable.

For Robert and Emily Wagner, this was the perfect man for the job, for their families had already left and made it to California in the months ahead of them. The newlyweds were not ready to leave Missouri as they did not wish to interrupt their honeymoon and first few months as a new couple. The time had come for them to leave, but no one was willing to cross the mountains in the dead of winter, knowing how dangerous the paths could be. And that's when they found Oskar. The only man willing to take the couple across the mountains and to their new home.

""Don't vorry,"" said Oskar, ""you and vife vill be good care taken. Vill chews many good foods in California.""

""Ah, yes,"" replied Robert, ""we hope to be eating full meals with our families soon!""

And so the three departed from the Midwest and set off for California, with Oskar guiding their steps the whole way. The first few weeks were nothing to speak of. Long days on the wagon and nights under a full sky of stars. It was getting colder, but nothing they couldn't manage with a few blankets and a warm fire.

Then it was time to cross the mountains. There were safe passes that would get them to California and to the land of sunshine, but it would be a few more weeks of crossing. The Wagners, impatient newlywed couple they were, asked Oskar if he did not know of a faster way. Canned meats and old beans were manageable, but their stomachs were growing tired of the same thing day in and day out and they wished to be in California as soon as possible.

Ever pragmatic, Oskar was unwilling to go along at first. He had already sent word of their arrival time weeks before they left with another wagon train. Were anything to happen to them, the Wagner's families would not be looking for them right away. The Hastings Cutoff, the quicker path, would save them almost a month on their journey if all went to plan, but that month could make or break them if it all went awry.

After needling and prodding their Russian guide, the Wagner's finally got their way. A whole month sooner in California! Fresh food and warm beds! And for Oskar, it meant more opportunity to get back to work with another group to guide. It was decided. They would taking the Hastings Cutoff and brave the mountain paths and the cold, cold winter skies.

At first, all seemed to being going to plan. They were making headway, and the dream of California was growing closer. And then, the snow descended.

While set up for camp one evening, the winds began to howl and the snow began to fall. And fall it did. First it was inches, then it was feet. Before they knew what could be done, they were locked in snow banks taller than three men. The mules had run off to seek their own shelter as the storm began. When Oskar managed to tunnel out of their snowy prison, he could see nothing but a blanket of white around them for as far as he could see. Without the mules to pull the wagon, they were stuck. And even with the animals, who knew how long it would be before the snow had melted off enough for them to move. Making the trek on foot was out of the question, they would not have enough food for the trip, having to carry it all on their backs, and a young woman in tow. They were stranded. The dream of California was suddenly looking very distant.

In the weeks that followed, their hopes were raised and dashed, raised and dashed. Just when the sun seemed to come out for long enough to possibly melt away their frozen prison, the clouds would descend and they would find inches more snow atop their icy tomb. With each glimpse of sun and further snowfall, the snow around them froze harder and harder as it melted and solidified. What seemed like a temporary setback was becoming far more dire.

It was after the second month that the food began to run out. They had hoped to cut a month off their trip, but being stranded for so long, they had not anticipated that their supplies would dwindle in this fashion. With each passing day the growl in their stomachs grew louder and the hollowness of their cheeks ever more apparent. They were starving and help was nowhere to be found.

Robert and Emily were in love. They were young and they were naive. And they had no one to blame but themselves for pressuring their guide into this horrible situation. As the days wore on and the hunger intensified, Emily grew weaker and weaker, but her love for Robert grew ever stronger. It was when she could barely raise herself to sit up that she spoke the words that would haunt Robert for the rest of his days.

""Robert, I am not going to make it. But you will. You need to eat, Robert.""

And with that, she grabbed Oskar's knife and slit her throat. In her weakened state, there was nothing the two men could do to save her. She bled out and died, leaving the two men with her last words hanging in the air between them.

For the first few days, Robert was inconsolable. He lay in a heap near Emily's body, whimpering and sobbing. His wife was gone and he was all alone in the world, trapped in an icy hell. But hunger will do terrible things to people. It finally became too much for him to handle. The emotional pain was ever present, but the physical pain in his stomach was becoming too much to bear. Emily's last words rang in his ears when he looked up at Oskar.

""We have to do it, Oskar. She will have died for nothing if we don't.""

Fate is cruel and fate is fickle. Not long after the men had consumed what they could to stay alive the sun finally came out and stayed out. How quickly their snowy hell became a sheet of ice solid enough to walk on. With the energy of full stomachs for the first time in weeks, it was decided they would push on, on foot. The disastrous newlyweds' families would surely be looking for them by now. They had been delayed so long, if only the two men could make it far enough along their route, perhaps they would find worldly salvation, having left heavenly salvation behind with the grisly choice they made with the young bride.

The hike on foot was treacherous, but manageable. They had food, as far as it could be described, in their packs and a willingness to survive. They carried on for two weeks in this fashion, dining on their regret and making headway. And then they saw it.

A fire! Someone else! Another human soul!

They approached the encampment and found the newlyweds' fathers with a group of cousins and siblings. They were saved! The rescue posse had set out not long after the arrival date of the newlyweds had come and passed. With no way of contacting them, they stayed out every night, eyes on the horizon, looking for their kin. Of course, the celebration was not long lived. Someone was obviously missing.

And with that, Robert broke down in front of the patriarchs of the family and told the tale of their plight. He wept uncontrollably, describing the grisly decision he and Oskar were forced to make in light of Emily's actions. A look of horror passed across the faces of the men in the group as they understood what they were hearing. Horror and disgust and a mixture of pure pity for this soul in front of them who had crossed a line no man ever wished to cross.

It was then that Robert's father looked over at Oskar, who had remained silent during the young man's tale of life saved by a life given. ""You too, Oskar? Did you...eat...her as well?""

And with that, Oskar hung his head. In all his years of guiding, he had never had to make a decision like the one he had made, trapped in the snow, high in the mountains, with a pain in his stomach like no pain he had felt in his many years on this earth. He looked up at the old men and answered:

""It is true. I also chews dis guy's dead vife.""

 When the wind would blow hard enough, her dress would rise up, revealing that she wasn't wearing any underwear beneath it. Then he got an idea.

 ""Johnny, ya see that hole 'tween your Ma's legs whenever the wind blows her dress up?"", he asked, ""Watch me go get it!"" Then Pa runs across the yard and starts banging into his ole'lady.

 As Little Johnny is watching this, his friend Little Susie comes walking around the side of the house. ""Whatcha doin', Little Johnny?"" She asks.

 ""My Pa is teachin' me about the birds n' bees."" he replies.

“Look jingle bells!”, he said as he shook them around to create a dull jingle. 
St. Peter exhaled lightly from his nose and grinned. “Okay fine on you go, it’s Christmas after all.”, he said and opened the gate. 

The second man took his step forward and presented a stick of gum to St. Peter. 
“It’s peppermint!”, he exclaimed. 
St. Peter sighed and shook his head
“Oh what the hell its Christmas go ahead.”

Finally, the third man stepped forward.
“Well... what have you?”, the holy gate keeper asked.

Meanwhile, the driver continues on.  He starts seeing the signs with increasing frequency - RE, RE, RE, RE...

As it is quite late, he starts becoming a bit delirious and begins to imagine a crazy cat screeching with every sign he passes - “RE! RE! RE! RE!” The image is so strong in his mind that he can see the cat’s face and body and hear crystal clear the screech “RE! RE! RE! RE!”

At this point, he finds this image to be so hilarious that he can no longer contain himself and begins crazily laughing and swerving the car.

All this commotion wakes up the passenger who exclaims “what in the world is going on?”

Coming back to his senses, and realizing he could never articulate the crazy story to his friend, the driver says:

Later, the abbot returns. ""I believe I have your answer,"" he tells the stranger. ""You should head North until you reach Scotland.

The abbot watches him out of sight and then turns to Brother Doorkeeper. ""I hope I have given him sound counsel,"" he sighs. ""I may have spoken with too much confidence, for the text I read was written in a language with which I am not very skilled.""

As she is leaving the doc says, ""Well there is one thing you could try, but you have to do it EVERY DAY."" He tells her to rub her chest and say, ""Eenie meenie miney moe, I want my boobs to grow, grow grow.""

She leaves the office, thinking the doctor is out of his mind.

However, after thinking a while she figures, ""Why not? It's free, it's easy... what do I have to lose?"" So, every morning before work she chants: ""Eenie meenie miney moe, I want my boobs to grow, grow grow.""

After a few weeks it begins to work! She is thrilled.

One morning a few weeks later she wakes up late for work. She rushes to catch the bus without doing her daily chant.

She doesn't want to miss even one day, so she goes to the back of the bus and whispers while rubbing her chest, ""Eenie meenie miney moe, I want my boobs to grow, grow grow.""

""*These three envelopes were left to you by the previous employee who was recently let go. He said to open them in order if you ever got into a jam.*""

The job didn't seem so tough, and after all, why would I want to take advice from the guy who was just fired? I threw the envelopes into a drawer and settled into my new job. The people were friendly, there were always fresh donuts and bottomless coffee, and everything always just fell into place.

Until one day it hit the fan. Everyone came looking for me for this major issue, and I'll be honest, I didn't know what to do. For whatever reason, I was reminded of the envelopes and proceeded to open the one marked #1.

""*Blame the previous guy.*""

Well, sure! I mean, if it wasn't for all the stuff he did in the past, we wouldn't be in this predicament now! I told everyone it was the previous guy's fault, and everyone seemed to accept that. Slowly, business got back to normal. I felt like I dodged a bullet. Months went by and not a single bump in the road. And then...Another emergency. I could hear people yelling my name, and not in a good way. Without hesitation, I reached for envelope #2.

""*Blame the support staff*.""

Right? I mean, if they were doing their job and told me sooner, I could've fixed all of this before it was even a problem! Everyone nodded. Couldn't argue with that logic. I was relieved to have dodged another bullet. I must be pretty good at this after all!

A full year went by and, sure, some people had since been let go, but I was still sitting pretty with a good job and a carefree attitude. Things just always seemed to work out! When the next crisis hit, I wasn't even phased. I could hear the people yelling my name, and I could almost even imagine them carrying pitchforks all aimed at me. Whatever. I still had that final envelope which I opened as everyone was amassed at my door.

""*Prepare three envelopes,*"" it said...","""When I started my job, they handed me three envelopes.""",26

One year Buddy and Edna went to the fair, and Buddy said,

'Edna, I'm 85 years old. If I don't ride that helicopter, I might never get another chance'

To this, Edna replied,

""Buddy that helicopter ride is fifty bucks, and fifty bucks is fifty bucks'

'Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and don't say a word I won't charge you a penny! But if you say one word it's fifty dollars.'

Buddy and Edna agreed and up they went.

The pilot did all kinds of fancy manoeuvres, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word...

When they landed, the pilot turned to Buddy and said,

'By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm impressed!'

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you"", and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night Teresa kept shouting ""Oh, my God!""

He'd only have sex with the lights off.

However, 20 years of blind sex took its toll on her and their relationship. In the middle of one of their love-making sessions, the wife dived for the lamp and turned on the light.

She saw her husband with his pants on and a dildo in hand.

There was a brief moment of silence, then the wife sternly stated ""You have some explaining to do.""

The husband looked her dead in the eye and said ""I'll explain this when you explain the kids"".",A husband will only have sex with his wife on one condition,1239

So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping-pong balls and paints them black. The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, ""Here's this week's question,"" Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping-pong balls rolling to the front of the room. Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.

The teacher says, "" Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?""

Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, ""Dave Chappell, see ya on Tuesday!""",So there’s this teacher that tells her class anyone who correctly answers a special question she’s going to ask on Friday won’t have to come to school on Monday.,43

She asked the schoolmaster if he would recommed any. He took her to see several rooms, and when everything was settled she returned home to make final preparations for the move. When she arrived home, the thought suddenly occured to her that she had not seen a Water Closet (toilet) around the place. She immediately wrote a note to the schoolmaster asking him if there was a ""W.C."" near the room.

The schoolmaster was a poor master of english so he asked the parish priest about the meaning of the letters ""W.C."" and the only solution they could come up with for the letters was ""Wayside Chapel"". The schoolmaster then wrote the following note to the English lady seeking a ""W.C."" with her room.

Dear Madam: I take great comfort in informing you that a ""W.C."" is situated nine miles from the house in the corner of a beautiful grove of pine trees, surrounded by lovely grounds. It is capable of holding 229 people, and it is open on Sundays and Thursdays only. As there are a great many people expected during the summer months, I would suggest that you come early, although there is usually plenty of standing room. This is an unfortunate situation, particularly if you are in the habit of going regularly. You will no doubt be glad to hear that a good many bring their lunch and make a day of it, while others, who can't afford to go by car, arrive just in time. I would especially advise your ladyship to go on Thursdays when there is an organ accompaniest. The acoustics are excellent and even the most delicate sounds can be heared everywhere. It may interest you to know that my daughter was married in the ""W.C."" and it was there that she met her husband. I can remember the rush there was for seats. There were ten people to a seat usually reserved for one, and it was wonderful to see the expression on their faces.

The newest attraction is a bell, donated by a wealthy resident of the district, which rings every time a person enters. A Bazaar is to be held to raise money for plush seats for all, since the people believe it is a long felt want. My wife is rather delicate so she can't go regularly: it is almost a year since she went last. Naturally it pains her not to be able to go more often. I shall be delighted to reserve the best seat for you, if you wish, where you will be seen by all. For the children there is a special time so that they will not disturb the elders.

Hoping to have been of some service to you, I remain,

Sincerely, The Schoolmaster",An english schoolteacher was in Switzerland...,7
