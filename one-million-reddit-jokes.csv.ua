So now that 9 has been eaten, 10 has gone into protective custody, 8 was taken down by 7 (let's just say he got lucky), 6 has been arrested, 4 drowned in France, 12 decided to run off with a dozen (what a skank).

She tried to again take the step, only to discover that she couldn’t.  So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step.  Once again, much to her embarrassment she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to take the step.  About this time, a large guy who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. The went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch my body! I don’t even know who you are!""

He locks up the brakes and skids side to side, desperately tries to not run over the rabbit.  The rabbit takes a couple hops to the left and SPLAT! The front right tire flattens the bunny.  

Moments later the vegan is sitting on the side of the road, hands in his face, tears pouring down his cheeks over committing murder.  He sees another car approach and stop near him.  A salesman type gets out of his Buick and rushes up to the scene of the accident.  ""What happened!""

""It was horrible!  I was driving along...I tried to stop...but I killed this poor, defenseless bunny!  I don't know what to do!  I can't call the police!  I have no cell service!""

The salesman looks at the flat rabbit, then looks at the crying vegan, looks back to the rabbit again, thinks for a moment then smiles ""Don't worry buddy.  I got just the thing!""  

The salesman runs to the trunk of his car and digs around for five minutes.  He pulls out an aerosol can and races back to the vegan who is now standing over the rabbit.

The salesman sprays the rabbit and amazingly, it suddenly twitches.  He sprays again and the rabbit flips over once and lays still.  He sprays it for a good minute and suddenly the rabbit springs to life!  It shakes it's head, smiles at the two standing there, gives a little wave and proceeds to hop down the highway.  After about twenty feet, the rabbit stops, turns and waves at them again then continues on his way.  The rabbit stops once again, turns and waves at the two and continues once again down the highway.  

The salesman and vegan watch the bunny hop away into the sunset as it stops every so often and wave back at them.

When the rabbit is finally out of sight the vegan turns to the salesman ""That was beautiful and amazing!  What is in that can?  You should make millions selling it!  What is it?""

The salesman holds the can up with a smile ""Hare restorer with a permanent wave""",Poor little Rabbit,35

Three students are selected to meet personally with the representative. The three students arrive at the appointed office, where the Pokemon rep sits solemnly behind a desk in the middle of the room. Atop the desk sits three black boxes.

""Welcome"" the rep begins ""You three were all selected due to your exceptional entries. Unfortunately, due to the limited available spaces, I am only authorized to select two of you""

The three students glance nervously to one another, wondering who the unlucky third person will be.

""As you can see, I have three black boxes in front of me. Two are empty, but the third holds a commemorative Pokemon memorabilia as a constellation prize for your efforts."" he explains ""You three will take turns reaching into a box of your choosing to determine the two winners.""

The first student steps forward, and picks his box. He puts his right hand in and when he takes his right hand out it remains empty. 

The second student picks his box. Puts his right hand in and takes his right hand out, also empty.

The third student is crushed. He was so sure this was going to be his big break. Defeated, he simply stares at the closed black box.

He went and saw that he looked like a good player so he decided to bring him back to Liverpool on a trial for the rest of the season.
Hussain trained and played with the Under 21's for the season. Meanwhile, Liverpool's fortunes were changing as they started to win more games. It went down to the last game of the season where they were playing against rivals Manchester United, which they had to win to become league champions. Klopp had seen good things from Hussain in training, so he decided to promote to the first team bench.
The match started horribly for Liverpool and they were 2-0 down at half time. Klopp was enraged as he gave the team talk in the dressing room before the players went out for the second half. He then decided that he would give Hussain his first appearance as a last throw of the dice to see if he could make something happen. 
The second half started and within minutes Liverpool were on the attack, running down the wing into a crossing position. The ball was whipped in to the box and Hussain, with his first touch of the ball, struck a sweet volley which nestled into the top corner. Suddenly, the fans started to sing as they started to believe that the impossible may happen. The game went on and in the 80th minute they had another chance as the ball again went down the wing and another whipped cross met Hussain, and this time a perfect header left the keeper with no chance and the score was 2-2 and now it seemed more than ever that they could do it. It was the last minute of injury time when Hussain picked up the ball in the middle of the pitch. He swivelled in and out through 4 players, when he was then taken down in the box. The ref gave a penalty, and Hussain stepped up to take it. There was never any doubt as he coolly slotted it away to complete the hat trick and the win for Liverpool, giving them their first league title in 27 years.
The stadium erupted in joy as they finally did it, after years of disappointment. Klopp was over the moon with Hussain and promised him a new contract in a few days as well as a brand new car, and asked if he wanted anything else. Hussain asked to phone home to tell them what had happened, so klopp took him straight to his office to use the phone. Hussain phoned home, and his mum picked up and Hussain, as excited as ever told her everything that had just occurred. As soon as he finished, his mum in a sad voice said that he should come home. Hussain, sensing something was wrong, asked what was going on. His mum then told him about how his dad has been caught in some crossfire and was hit by a bullet, and she had been mugged and his sister had been raped. Hussain started sobbing and said that he was sorry that all this had happened, and his mother replied 'well you should be, considering you're the one who brought us to Liverpool'.","Liverpool were going through a tough time in the league, so jurgen klopp about how he could turn their fortunes around",0

He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant “I'm terribly sorry but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don't recognise any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording?”

The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European Vespidae acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologies and lifts the needle onto the next track.

Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant ""No, this just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don't recognise any of these sounds.""

The assistant apologises again and lifts the needle to the next track.

The expert throws off the headphones as soon as it starts playing and is fuming with rage. ""This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and no European wasp has *ever* made a sound like the ones on this record!""

The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over.

In fact, we were so well-known that we were actually picked from all other shops in London to host Britain's first-annual Ice Cream Seller's contest. Over a thousand people turned up, and they actually had to cordon off part of the Thames with a buoyed police rope due to the traffic we were generating! The events ranged from Fastest Scoop to Best Waffle Cone to my favorite--Milkshakes in a Minute. The rule was, as one might expect, to blend as many shakes as possible in a minute's time. I was a champion at this, and quickly set to work, but as I was mixing the concrete, my machine jammed! I was right by the waterfront, and as the spinning increased, the torque was so powerful that it blasted my shake mixer straight out the back of my shop window and into the river!

...Well, not only did the agony end there, but a strange thing started to happen: due to the mixture of the ice cream base, the milk, and the water, a foam started developing that actually pushed the roped-off barrier in the Thames, buoys and all, up the dock!

""What are these guys in the big suits doing?""

      A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts.

      Recognizing a promotional opportunity, the NASA folks found a tape recorder. After the old man recorded his message, they asked his son to translate it. He refused. The NASA PR people brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but they refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.

      Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government translator. His translation of the old man's message was ""Watch out for these guys; they have come to steal your land.""

    ""It's quite simple,"" she says. ""Just look for the things to which, or for which, people make great sacrifices.

In pre-Columbian Mexico, look at the sacifice of humans on the Aztec altars of their gods. Even in modern India, look at the outrageous burdens placed on people in their remarkable veneration of cows. When people let something dominate their entire lives, to the extent that they don't even notice it anymore, that's the key sign of cultural obsession.""

    ""As a final note,"" she goes on, ""it's striking that America is free of any dominant cultural obsession. That may be one of the hallmarks of a true demcracy.""

    She begins to pick up her books. ""I'm sorry, but that will be the end of lecture for today. My car's in the shop to have its radio repaired, and I need to get my rental car out of the parking lot before I get a fine, buy some gas, get across town before the rush hour traffic gets too bad, and pick up my car before the garage closes.

    ""I hope you won't mind my asking,"" said the Brit, ""but what do the two red bars on your flag represent?""

    ""Well,"" replied the Canadian gentlman, ""one of the bars stands for the courage and hardiness of our people in settling the cold expanses and broad prairies of our country. The other is for the honesty and integrity for which Canadians are known.""

    The Brit mulled this over and nodded. Having poor eyesight at his advanced age, and not being familiar with maple leaves, he then asked, ""And what's that six-pointed item in the middle of your flag?""

    ""Oh, that's to remind us of the six words of our national motto,"" the Canadian lady piped up.

    The Brit asked, ""And what are those six words?""

    The Canadian smiled and replied, ""They are 'Don't blame us - we're not Americans.'""

The bartender is getting a little annoyed at this point, and turns to the third man and asks him the same thing. The man says, 'I'll have some rum and coke, please.' The bartender then serves all of them and once they are well and drunk on 4 rounds of rum and coke, they go home and gangbang the pregnant woman"".

A frog walks into a bank to get a loan. He walks over to the bank teller--her name's Whack (nametag says Whack).
Frog: ""Yes, I'd like to get a loan.""

Teller: ""A loan? But you're a frog! I don't think we can do that.""

Frog: ""Well, it's really important that I get this loan...anything you can do will help.""

Teller: ""Well, idk...what's your name?""

Frog: ""Kermit.""

Teller: ""Kermit THE FROG?! But you don't look anything like Kermit the Frog!""

Frog: ""No, no, no...I was named after him. My full name's Kermit Jagger. You see, my mother's a frog and my father's Mick Jagger............he fucked a frog, and, well, now I'm here.
But anyway, I'd really like to get a loan, for a lilypad.""

Teller: ""I see. Well since you've got no credit, it'll be difficult to get you a loan. Do you have anything you can leave as collateral?""

Frog: (Pauses) ""Yes. I think I have something that will work.""

He reaches into his frog pocket and pulls out a tiny pink elephant made of porcelain. He holds it up to examine it for a moment. The teller looks at it, puzzled. Finally he hands it to her. (Her first name's Patti.)

Teller: ""Uh...I'm not sure. I'll have to talk to the bank manager about this."" (leaves to manager's office)

Teller (to manager): ""Hey, we've got a Kermit Jagger out here...His mother's a frog and his father's Mick Jagger. He wants to get a loan for a lilypad but all he has for collateral is this."" (holds up pink elephant)

Manager: (pauses, looking at the elephant) ""What it that?"" (takes it in his hand to examine) ""What is this?""

After some time, he looks at her.

""Why, this is a Knick Knack, Patti Whack! Give the frog a loan! His old man's a Rollin Stone!""

The only problem was, the leather on the seats had aged, and any time it rained he would have to rub the seats with petroleum jelly to protect it from the weather.  

 He meets a girl, and after some time together, she decides to take him to dinner at her parents’ house.  The night of the dinner, the new girlfriend tells the young motorcycle stud about the “rule” during dinner.  The rule is that whoever talks during dinner has to wash every dish in the kitchen.  She explains that no one has talked during dinner for years, and there are piles upon piles of dishes in the kitchen. 

Sure enough they get to the parents’ home and the kitchen is an even worse disaster than the girlfriend had described.  

The parents and the young couple  enjoy some friendly small talk before dinner, but as soon as they sit down at the table, not one sound is made.

The young stud decides to have a little fun with the situation.  He throws his girlfriend on the table, pulls her pants down, and starts making passionate love to her.  The girl’s parents are noticeably angry.  But no one utters a word.  Having gone this far, the young stud decides to push his luck a little further.  He grabs the mother and starts having sex with her.  The mother is a little surprised, the girlfriend is mad, and the father is furious, but no one says a word.  All of the sudden, it starts to rain cats and dogs.  The young stud reaches into his bag and grabs his petroleum jelly.  The father throws down his napkin, stand up and says, “Alright, alright, I’ll do the dishes!”

Meanwhile, boy turned to the guy and told him:

-sir, I have a white teddy bear,

-so?

-you will buy my white teddy bear

-why would I? I'm a grown up

-no sir, you will buy it or I'll go out and tell my father

-ok, ok... how much is that?

-$50

-you kiddin'? I'm not giving this money for your fucking white teddy bear

-then I'll go out and tell my dad

-ok, ok... here's your $50


after a while...

-sir, give me my white teddy bear back

-no way, I just paid 50 bucks for it

-then I'll tell my dad!

-ok,ok... here's it!


and after a while...

-sir, I have a white teddy bear

-yes! I know, I know

-and you're going to buy it for $100

-no fucking way!

-then I'll just tell my fa...

and it went on like this until the morning. the day after, the boy bought himself a bike, and while driving it, his mother asked:

-how did you buy it?

-I found money on the street

-but you cannot use such a money, it's a sin. now go right back to the bike shop, give it back, take the money and donate it to the church. And also confess too, for your sin


boy did it unhappily, and went to the church to confess.. father beside him asked:


-what's your sin, my son?

-father, I have a white teddy bear

-fuck you you fuckin' robber! Is that you again?

So the lizard goes up the tree and smokes a few more joints with the koala. After a little while, the lizard decides to go down to the pond to get a drink for his dry mouth, so he scurries down the tree and over to the pond where there was a crocodile waiting. 

The crocodile says ""woah man, what are you doing drinking from the pond?"" ""Well I smoked a few joints with this koala and I have really bad dry mouth,"" the lizard responded. 

In shock, the crocodile says, ""fuck me, there's a weed smoking koala? I have to see this!"" 

So the crocodile climbs out of the pond and walks over to the tree where the koala has smoked 4 or 5 more joints since the lizard left.

The crocodile says, ""Hey mate, what are you doing up there?""

Then he asks, “OK, how about once a year?”

One man in the back jumps up and down, jubilantly waving his hands. The therapist is shocked—this disproves his theory. “If you make love only once a year,” he asks, “why are you so happy?”

He responded, “It might be a challenge to fit all through, but they will be fine.” 

Still unsure, Changlong went to console another general, Feng Fenhui. He asked, “You know about our navy well. Do you think our ships passing through in the south will be ok?” Fenhui thought for a moment, then with confidence announced, “It’ll be a tight fit, but they’ll all fit in there.”

Changlong, satisfied that Fenhui’s answer matched Xinping’s, said “That’s what Xi said.”

Steve goes flying out of the truck bed and lands with a huge splash in the water.

&amp;nbsp;


The truck is sinking fast and Derrick manages to escape through the driver side window. Out of the corner of Derrick's eye he sees a blurry figure struggling in the bed of his truck. Out of breath, Derrick surfaces, scanning for signs of John, but only finds Steve. 

&amp;nbsp;


Derrick ""Oh shit! I think John is sinking with the truck!"" Steve, catching his breath said ""Fuck! I'm diving down to look for him.""

&amp;nbsp;

30 minutes pass and still no sign of John. Derrick and Steve are sitting on the bank sobbing, while Search and Rescue continue searching for John. 5 seconds later a huge splash followed by a gasp of air startle both Derrick and Steve.

&amp;nbsp;

""JOHN! THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING?? WEREN'T YOU IN THE BED?!"" said Derrick.

&amp;nbsp;

John, catching his breath responds ""I couldn't get out brother, you locked your fucking tail gate again.""

The bartender fixes up a nice sandwich for the panda, working especially hard at it since its not every day a panda is at his bar.

He serves it to the panda, who politely eats the whole thing.

Just as the bartender is waiting for a reaction on the sandwich, the panda pulls out 2 pistols from his panda pouch and unleashes a hail of gunfire. He systematically walks around the tavern killing everything that moves, only stopping to reload.

When the carnage finally stops, the bartender is the only survivor spared by the panda. 

The panda calmly starts walking to the front door. The frightened bartender is barely able to get out a feeble ""but why...?"".

The panda stops, turns around, and says ""I'm a panda, look it up"".

Later, after giving his statement to the police, he goes home and finds a dictionary. He turns to the P section and finds ""Panda"". It reads:

Panda - noun - Black and white bear that eats, shoots and leaves.
