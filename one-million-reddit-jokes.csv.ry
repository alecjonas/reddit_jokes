the Eversweet Company.

In court, the Eversweet Company's hot-shot solicitor was questioning
Paddy.

'Didn't you say to the police at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine?'
asked the solicitor.

Paddy responded: 'Well, I'll tell you what happened. I'd just loaded my
fav'rit cow, Bessie, into da... '

'I didn't ask for any details', the solicitor interrupted. 'Just answer
the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm
fine!'?'

Paddy said, 'Well, I'd just got Bessie into da trailer and I was
drivin' down da road.... '

The solicitor interrupted again and said,'Your Honour, I am trying to
establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he was fine. Now several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question. '

By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Paddy's answer and said to the solicitor: 'I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favourite cow, Bessie'.

Paddy thanked the Judge and proceeded. 'Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my fav'rit cow, into de trailer and was drivin' her down de road when this huge Eversweet truck and trailer came tundering tru a stop sign and hit me trailer right in da side. I was trown into one ditch and Bessie was trown into da udder. By Jaysus I was hurt, very bad like, and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moanin' and groanin'. I knew she was in terrible pain just by her groans.

Shortly after da accident, a policeman on a motorbike turned up. He could hear Bessie moanin' and groanin' too, so he went over to her.
After he
looked at her, and saw her condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.

Den da policeman came across de road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, 'How are you feelin'?'

He began sweating profusely and cursing the gods for his luck, as his sphincter began shaking angrily. He thinks to himself, maybe he would be able to get away with letting just the tiniest bit out. He leans slightly to the left and lets out just a squeek.


""SPOT!...."" the dad bellows, looking menacingly at the family dog. 

""Holy shit"", our hero thinks, the father just blamed the dog. So he leans to the left again and this time lets out a longer trumpet toot. 

""SPOOTTT!!!...."" the father again yells, louder and with more urgency. ""Okay"" our man thinks, ""I am getting off scott free with this. I'm just gonna let it loose."" So he leans all the way to the left and lets out the nastiest, thickest, loudest fart he ever experienced in his life, lasting a solid 30 seconds.

I mean how many times do I have to tell them? My name is not ""Help"" or ""Getoffme."" Get it right. Its *Brock Turner*. 

------

Since many have mentioned it yes. Yes my Rape joke is innacurate to the actual events. But the entire point of the joke was to emphasis the fact that Brock Turner is a Rapist. So, if any of you would like to improve on the joke go ahead. I really don't care, just don't bombard the the subreddit with Brock Turner rape jokes or it will most likely get banned, and become stale. :* have fun and spread the good word.

“Stop, in the name of the Sultan!” came a warning shout.
“The galley is hailing us, sir!” the Boatswain told the Captain.
“Put it on the main scream,” Captain Quid instructed.
“BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER JIDDA, YOU MUST SWEAR THAT UNDER NO CONDITION WILL YOU FIRE UPON A SULTAN’S SHIP!” the galley’s officer screamed.
“Damme, I will not!” the Captain roared.
“Thank you; you may proceed.”
Jidda had never been designed for modern 19th-century ships, so the frigate was wedged with difficulty into a narrow slip. Soon Sir Hillary Throckmorton-Shillingsworth III disembarked in his Ananga Ranga disguise. The Gnome Light was concealed in his turban. He was accompanied by the First Mate, wearing a borrowed robe.
The two interlopers caught the last caravan to Mecca. Wrapping themselves in the traditional pilgrim’s garments of unsewn cloth, they turned their clothes over to the Wahhabi attendants, passing on the Gnome Light in the process. Now that the business part of the trip had been completed, Ananga Ranga confidently joined a file of pilgrims that wound into the sacred Bait-al-Allah, forbidden to Christians upon pain of death.
When his turn came to face the Ka’aba, Ananga Ranga fell to his knees, exclaimed “Allah be praised!” and fervently crossed himself. With howls of outrage, the crowd seized the invaders! The air rang with the sound of swords unsheathing.
“Wait! Excuse me! I can explain,” the First Mate babbled desperately. “My friend was just making the first ritual motions for rearranging his clothing, to make a sarong — you see?” he offered, demonstrating on himself. “It’s a traditional rite among the, er, um, Legume tribe, whereby they humble themselves before the grandeur of Allah!”
“I don’t think so,” boomed the Haram Sharif.

""Second, and more importantly, your wife is going to bleed periodically. When she does this, it is imperative that you DO NOT let her get in the ocean."" ""I think I can handle that."" Said Adam.

Several weeks passed and sure enough, just as God had said, Eve began to bleed. Before Adam even knew what was happening, Eve was already washing herself in the surf.  Adam watched in horror as the ocean began to turn red. The change was subtle at first but before long the entire ocean was red as far as the eye could see. Adam knew he fucked up so he went into hiding. He watched from the bushes as God came down, looked over the ocean, shook his head, and began to clean the ocean. 

Adam watched for 9 days as this continued until the ocean was bluer than it had been when it was originally created. When Adam saw that God was finished, he came out of hiding and immediately tried to butter God up and get back in his good graces.

""Man, the water is spectacular. You did an amazing job! It looks better than it did when you first created it."" ""Thank you"" the Lord responded, ""It was no easy task. It took far less effort to create it than it did to fix it."" Adam continued to Praise the work that had been done... ""This is the most magnificent sight I've ever laid my eyes upon! You sure can do some amazing things, Lord."" ""Thank you my son."" The Lord responded. ""I did what I could to make things normal again."" ""Normal!? It looks better than new! what do you mean you did what you could? It seems to me that you made it better!"" The Lord shook his head as said ""It may look normal but I was unable to return everything to it's original state. I was able to clean the water in a matter of several days but I tried and tried and tried but I don't think I'll ever be able to get the smell out of the fish.""",God's rules for Adam,24

Disgruntled, he puts it back on the market.

The middle son thinks she should have some excitement in her life, so he buys her a new sports car. He brings it to her and she has a smile on her face. She says, ""I really love this car but it's too fast for me. I can barely see the road and I hardly drive anymore, but thank you anyway"". Disappointed, he keeps it for himself.

The youngest son realises that she is all alone and decides to get her a talking parrot so she'll have some company. He arranges it to be delivered to her house a few days before they all go there for dinner.

When the brothers turn up, they all sit down for a lovely meal and discuss their gifts. The youngest looks around and cannot see his gift. He asks his mother, ""Mum, what did you think of the parrot?"".

Wee Jock (a typical Scottish wag) thinks, ""Ya dancer. Ah'm pure dead brilliant at ma general knowledge stuff an' that. This is gonnae be a dawdle, come ahead ya radge, a lang weekend fir me.""

Teacher: ""Right class, who can tell me who said 'Don't ask what Your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country?'

Wee Jock shoots up his hand, waving furiously in the air.

Teacher looking round picks Jeremy at the front.

Teacher: ""Yes, Jeremy""

Jeremy (in a very English accent): ""Yes miss, the answer is J F Kennedy his inauguration speech in 1960.""

Teacher: ""Very good Jeremy. You may stay off Friday and Monday and we will see you back in class on Tuesday.""

The next Thursday comes around, and Wee Jock is even more determined.

Teacher: ""Who said. 'We will fight them on the beaches, we will fight them in the air, we will fight them at sea. But we will never surrender?'""

Wee Jock's hand shoots up, arm stiff as a board, shouting ""I know. I know, Me Miss, me Miss!""

Teacher looking round and picks Timothy, sitting at the front: ""Yes Timothy.""

Timothy (in a very, very posh, English accent):

""The answer is Winston Churchill, his 1941 Battle of Britain speech.""

Teacher: ""Very good Timothy, you may stay off Friday and Monday and come back to class on Tuesday.""

The following Thursday comes around and Wee Jock is hyper, he's been studying encyclopedias all week and he's ready for anything that comes.
He's coiled in his wee plastic chair, slavers dripping in anticipation.

Teacher: ""Who said 'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'?""

Wee Jock's arm shoots straight in the air, he's standing on his seat, jumping up and down screaming ""Miss, me miss, meeeeee!""

Teacher looking round the class picks Rupert, sitting at the front: ""Yes Rupert.""

Rupert (in a frightfully, frightfully, ever so plumy English accent): ""Yes miss, that was Neil Armstrong. 1969, the first moon landing.""

Teacher: ""Very good Rupert. You may stay off Friday and Monday and come back into class on Tuesday""

Wee Jock loses the plot altogether, tips his desk and throws his wee chair at the wall. He starts screaming: ""Fur fucks sake, where did all these English bastards come from?""

Teacher, looking round the class: ""Who said that?""

Wee Jock grabs his coat and bag and heads for the door, ""Sir William Wallace, Battle of Falkirk, July 1298, See yous on fook'in Tuesday!!""",general knowledge quiz,20

""Damn that's a good one. Haven't heard that before. Have fun."" The Genie replied, and with a click of his fingers, he was gone""

Astonished, the man wanted to go and test his luck. See if what he had just witness was real, or if he was turning mad. He walked into the nearest betting agency and started placing just stupid bets. To his surprise, he ended up £500 up. 

He thought he would try his luck again, and went to the Greyhound races. He put in all the money he earned hours previously, plus more. Once he left, he was £10,000 up. 

He thought to himself ""I've never had much luck with women."" so wondered over to the nearest whore house, which he was known to visit from time to time. As he entered the managers eyes lit up. ""You're never going to believe it"" the manager said while shaking him. ""What you've always wanted. She arrived this morning. Asian. 18 years old. Dead gorgeous. She's in the back room.""

The man couldn't believe it, and slowly made his way to the back room. And there she was. 

Just minutes later the man may there exhausted. ""That was amazing!"" He said trying to catch his breath. ""But I must ask, why the Bindi?""

""It's just for decoration really. You can take if off if you want."" She replied with a smile. The man reached towards her forehead and lightly scratched it off with his finger.

In the town of Victor, there is a church with a beautiful bell tower. There was only one problem though. The bell didn't ring. The townspeople were always late to church because they never knew when it started. In this town, there are only 30 residents, and so the mayor decided to call a town meeting. Everybody met in the mayor's room and started talking over all the possible solutions to this problem. Suddenly while everyone was talking, there was knock on the door. Everyone looked around the room. All 30 residents were gathered in this room, so who could this be? The mayor walked over to the door, and opened it, and standing there was a man with no arms and no legs. The man said, ""Hello. I heard about your bell problem, and I wanted to help you. I will ring the bell."" Everyone wondered how he had heard of their problem, but ignored it as the mayor said, ""How will you ring the bell? You haven't any arms."" The man smiled and said, ""Trust me."" The mayor shrugged and the town followed as he carried the man up the stairs of the church and into the bell tower. He set the man down, and the man turned towards the bell and took a deep breath. The man hit the bell with his face, and it made a beautiful sound. The most beautiful sound you have ever head. It was like a choir of angels singing. The townspeople were amazed. The priest offered the man a deal. All the man had to do was ring the bell at 7 o'clock every morning, and he would be provided with a place to stay, food, and water. The man graciously agreed and the deal was set. I left the town of Victor, but reports have it that this deal kept lasting, and that the man rung the bell every morning, right at 7 o'clock. The townspeople were never late, and they were very happy. About a year after the strange man had joined the town, I returned to Victor. As I rose in the morning I realized it was 6:55. I watched the clock, getting ready for the man to ring the bell. But instead, at 7, I heard a smash, then what sounded like a scream and a loud splat. I raced out of bed, and ran outside. I ran toward the sound, which had been the church. As I approached the church, I saw a man, lying on the ground. I looked, and he had no arms and no legs. The priest came outside and gasped. The townspeople were in shock. We weren't even sure who the mutilated corpse was, but what looked like a he, with no arms or legs, was covered in glass. The priest came out and rolled him over. The priest sighed and said, ""Well, I never got his name, but his face sure does ring a bell.""",A Bell of a Time,0

At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.

He proceeded to talk up a storm.

Upon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door:

1) Sip the vodka, don't gulp.

2) There are 10 commandments, not 12.

3) There are 12 disciples, not 10.

4) Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.

5) Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.

6) We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.

7) The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Big Daddy, Junior and the spook.

8) David slew Goliath; he did not kick the shit out of him.

9) When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.

10) We do not refer to the cross as the 'Big T.'

11) When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper he said, 'Take this and eat it for it is my body.' He did not say 'Eat me'.

12) The Virgin Mary is not called 'Mary with the Cherry.'

13) The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, Yeah God.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt bad and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played 'Amazing Grace,' the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen nothin' like that before and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""

Jesus just sighed.

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours of work.   

Satan observed this and became irate. 
'Wait!' he screamed. 'That's not fair! He cheated! How come he has all his work and I don't have any?'

So, he goes all the way downtown to the tux store and when he opens the door there's a huge long tux line. Apparently everyone in town waited until the last possible minute to rent a tux, which shouldn't be that surprising for a 17 year old boy.
So he waits and he waits and he waits and finally he gets his tux when he over hears two boys talking about their dates and he thinks ""Shit! I need to get a corsage.""
So Jimmy heads on down to the florist and of course there is a huge long corsage line. This too, of course shouldn't be surprising as flowers will die and you don't want to buy them too early. He waits and waits and finally he has his flowers. When he's leaving the shop he overhears two ladies looking at flowers and talking about wedding transportation and Jimmy groans and thinks ""I need a limo.""
Wouldn't you know it, prom season is prime wedding season as well, and when he gets to the rental agency theres a huge long limo line. Jimmy spends even longer waiting in the limo line than the other shops, it's nearly dark when he finally gets his limo.
Jimmy is relieved to finally have everything he needs for the prom and phones his girlfriend Penny to tell her the good news. Penny asks ""Did you get the prom tickets?"" Jimmy starts to panic when Penny laughs and told him she got them a week ago and scolds him for waiting so long to reserve everything.
The night of the prom arrives and when Jimmy and Penny get to the prom theres a huge long prom line to get in, because of course in this day and age they need to search the prom goers for drugs and alcohol and weapons. Jimmy submits to a pat down and goes into the prom.
Penny says lets go dance for a bit, and after some hard core boogying, Penny suggests they eat. Jimmy agrees and follows her to the buffet table where there's a huge long buffet line. So they wait and they wait getting hungrier and more impatient until they are finally laden with food and make there way to their table.
They had just begun to eat when Penny realizes she forgot drinks, to which Jimmy insists upon getting for the both of them. He heads over the the drinks table and there is no punch line.","It's a day before prom, and Jimmy realizes he still hasn't gotten his tux yet.",0

I am writing this letter slowly because I know you can't read fast.
We don't live where we lived when you left home. Your father read in the newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we moved 20 miles.
When we moved here, I brought the house number from the old house so our address will remain the same here also.
This place is really nice.
It even has a washing machine above the toilet. I'm not sure it works because last week I put in 3 shirts and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since.
The weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The first time it rained for 3 days and second time for 4 days.
The coat you wanted me to send you, your aunt Dolly said it will be a little too heavy with all the metal buttons to send by post mail, so we cut them off and put them in the pocket.
Your father has a new job. He has 500 people under him. He is cutting grass at the grave yard.
I took Violet to the club's poolside. The manager there is very cheeky. He told her 2-piece swimming suit is not allowed in the club. We were confused as to which piece should we remove?
Your sister had a baby this morning. I haven't found out if it is a girl or boy, so I don't know if you are an Auntie or Uncle.
Your uncle Peru, drowned when he fell in a big whisky tank at his work place. We cremated him and he burned for 3 days.
Your best friend Morga, is no more. He died trying to fulfill his father's last wishes. His father had wished to be buried at sea after he died. And your friend died while in the process of digging a grave for his father.
There isn't much more news this time. Nothing much has happened.
P.S: Son, I was going to send you some money but by the time I realised, I had already sealed off this letter.",A letter from home,3

The cop stammered, ""A what? A rectum stretcher? And just what does a rectum stretcher do?""

""Well,"" she said, ""I start by inserting one finger, then I work my way up to two fingers, then three, then four, then with my whole hand in I work from side to side until I can get both hands in, and then I slowly but surely stretch, until it's about 6 feet wide.""

The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly.  He was 51. 
Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin.  Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch.  The grave site was piled high with flours. 
Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.  Born and bread in Minnesota, Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.  He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. 
Despite being a little flaky at times, he still was a crusty old man, and was considered a positive roll model for millions.  Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough and three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven.  He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. 
The funereal was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes. 


If you smiled while reading this, please rise to the occasion and pass it on to someone having a crumby day or kneading a lift.

He refuses to get beaten by a woman, so he strains real hard.

Since defeat is totally unacceptable, he gives it everything he's got, and accidentally poops in the bed.

-that all robots/aliens want to kill every human for control of the planet/beer supply;

-time can be changed (Note: Timeline A may be discontinued or run parallel with Timeline B, unless Timeline C is more profitable then Timeline 616 may become rebirthed).

-all politicians are evil, greedy people  (unless it's that one guy who isnt);

-there is buried treasure under my house. I just have to solve the puzzles and find the secret passage;

-sex;

-humanity needs to find the hidden, all powerful (insert name of device/jewel/element) weapon to be powerful enough to take on our galactic enemies;

Danger left his every pore as he awoke back in his bed, in the third corner, where Jerry saw his ex-wife at the laundromat.  But it wouldn't be the last time, she was here each Friday to clean out yet another ex-boyfriend's wardrobe.  

For now it seemed each sheet of cloth was inspected closely like a fine artisan relegated to the product quality control line of the local painted figurine factory.  Dynamism was the secret to this line of fashion.  Dark circles under his eyes showed his disdain for facial features lacking such shapes.  Danger left his every pore as he awoke back in his bed, in the last corner, where everything was the way it was back in the day before dark cell phones and light cell phone towers.  

Dark and Light may mix in Ying Yang posters but not so in the case of Balsamic and Oil.  Please for Jerry it was too late for him to understand if his ex-wife ever was even there in the first place, lamenting perhaps the crisp excrement coating his coat's inner pockets, like a fine slime of smell quite unusual.  Putrid though may it have looked, he felt right at home in that old laundromat, never to be seen again.  Poor old Charlie never got off that MTA.","If Jews can breathe underwater, why are they not represented more strongly in the Summer Olympics? Asking for a friend.",0
