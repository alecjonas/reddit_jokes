It‚Äôs late at night when she arrives, and not a single one of her cellmates so much as stops snoring even after Andrea is shoved in and the door clangs shut. Tired and defeated, she picks up a strangely familiar smell just before she falls asleep.

Andrea wakes up the next day to an empty cell. Figuring the others must have gone down for breakfast already, she heads down herself. The cafeteria is packed, but after some searching, she manages to find a spot to sit that‚Äôs sufficiently far away from any glares of hostility towards the newbie. The inmate next to her is surprisingly talkative, and the topic of conversation eventually shifts to where their cells are.

‚Äú683,‚Äù Andrea says, and the look on her acquaintance‚Äôs face turns into a mixture of concern and pity.

‚ÄúOh, they threw you in with Betty?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs she?‚Äù

‚ÄúOld timer. Nasty-ass bitch. Got busted for dealing pot, but they also say she stabbed a client that tried stealing from her. Shivved her last cellmate before they threw you in, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow come she‚Äôs not in solitary?‚Äù

‚ÄúEven the guards don‚Äôt want to fuck with her. They even let her smoke. She‚Äôll share a joint, but just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take a pull before she does.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBad juju. Or she just stabs you.‚Äù

Andrea walks back to her cell skeptical, but still a bit on edge, and is greeted by the same smell from last night, but stronger. She sees an intimidating older woman take a pull from a joint and pass it to a cellmate. Must be Betty. After taking her own drag, the other woman looks for approval to Betty, who nods after sizing Andrea up. Andrea is handed the joint. It‚Äôs weak after having been passed around, but it‚Äôs just enough to soothe her nerves.

The ritual continues day after day, with Andrea sometimes fourth, sometimes third, and sometimes (rarely) second in line. If not for Betty‚Äôs near-inhuman lung capacity when it comes to cannabis smoke, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, but even on a good day, Andrea gets barely enough to satisfy her cravings.

One day, Andrea resolves that, bad juju be damned, she‚Äôll be having that first toke. Just after Betty lights up, she snatches the joint from her hand and takes a long, hard pull. The feeling is exhilarating. A second later, it gives way to a strange burning in her side. Looking down, Andrea finds a shiv inches-deep in her, with Betty, her face twisted with rage, clutching it. She shoves Andrea to the other side of the cell, but even as Andrea is blacking out, she notices Betty and her other cellmates wobbling as if sedated. The lights flicker, then short out.

With her last breath, Andrea asks, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Weakened, Betty replies:

‚ÄúMy toke, Andrea, is the powerhouse of the cell.‚Äù",A woman named Andrea gets sent to prison for marijuana possession.,8

A commercial comes on for a guaranteed weight loss of 10 pounds in a week.

So I thought, what the hell and signed up for it. Next morning an incredibly beautiful woman is standing at my door in nothing but a pair of running shoes and a sign about her neck that reads ""If you can catch me, you can have me."" Never had a girlfriend, I knew I had to catch her.

I tried to catch her, but was unable to. This continues for a week, at the end of which, I had lost 10 pounds.

After this I tried the next weight loss plan, 15 pounds in a week.

The next morning an even more beautiful woman is standing at the door, in similar conditions.

The same happens with her as the first woman, except I almost caught her.

This continues for a week, at the end of which I as suspected, weight 15 pounds less.

Excited about this success and a potential girlfriend, I decided to do the highest tier program.

Before I signed up, I was required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan.

Still I signed up. The next morning, waiting at the door, is a hulking 300 pound muscle man with nothing but a pair of running shoes, a raging erection, and a sign around his neck that says, ""If I catch you, you're mine!""

I was supposed to lose 20 pounds in the week, I lost 37.",Advertisement aren't always what they seemed.,78

He turns to Davy and asks ‚Äúhey man, my drink doesn‚Äôt taste right. Could you give it a quick sip?‚Äù
Davy takes a sip, and figures out that to fix it, another drink should be added to it.
So he calls out to the bartender and makes a special request to mix it in with another drink of his choosing, and after the bartender gives the two drinks a good mix, he serves it back to Davy. 

Davy takes a gulp and notices that it‚Äôs starting to taste less funny, but there‚Äôs still something missing. He passes it to Arrhenius, who was already listening in. He gives it a taste, and realises that the drink probably wasn‚Äôt shaken well enough, so he asks the bartender to beat it using an egg beater rather than just shaking it.

After spending a good minute or two thoroughly beating it, he hands it over to Arrhenius again, who tries it out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost there, I can feel it. But there‚Äôs one little thing missing I can‚Äôt put my finger on‚Äù

So then Br√∏nsted and Lowry chime in, suggesting they could try to fix it. They both halve the drink into two glasses and try out a sip. 
Determining that it‚Äôs just missing fruit juices, they call out to the bartender to add some sweet lemon juice. The bartender squeezes it in, gives it a thorough mix and serves it to them.

Having convinced themselves they finally managed to get the drink right, they both clink their glasses and take a sip.

They immediately fall to the ground gargling saliva as the alcoholic beverage begins pouring out of a burning hole from their throats.

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face ?""","A horse is sitting at home, watching MTV...",195

They cannot find their way back to civilisation and eventually they are taken prisoners by an unknown wild tribe.

The savages take them back to their village before their chief and not long after a ceremony is taking place for them. The prisoners are all forced to watch the entire thing; dancing and chanting around a fire and when they think they are finally going to be eaten or burnt alive, the Chief stands before them and asks:

What is your decision; Mokoko or Death?

He turns his gaze towards the Frenchman and while he doesn't know what Mokoko is, he presumes it is better than dying.

The chief then proceeds to remove his pants and brutally rape him with his giant dong in front of the wild crowd of savages and when he is done he sets the Frenchman free and tells him how to get back to civilisation. Hammered, the Frenchman runs away yelping from the village as fast as he can.

He then stands in front of the British explorer and says;

What is your decision; Mokoko or death?

The English and the Prussian are clearly horrified by the spectacle he just witnessed but the English says; 

I do not wish to die yet. I chose Mokoko over Death.

The chief is pleased and removes the pants of the Englishman and proceeds to rape him, much more brutally this time, before the wild cheering crowd of savages. When he's done he tells him how to get back to civilisation and lets him go. Terror stricken and crying, the Englishman runs away, limping back to civilisation.

Finally the allmighty Chief stands before the Prussian and asks:

What is your decision; Mokoko or Death?

The proud Prussian, enraged by the abominable spectacle says;

I was a soldier of Prussian army. The most disciplined and the most fearsome army Europe has ever seen. I have served Frederick the Great and defeated many enemy soldiers. I will never let you repugnant savages take my honour from me. I would rather die! I CHOOSE DEATH!

The cheering and taunting of the savages stops immediately after he finishes his words and a deathly silence falls. The Chief, as if expecting this response from him, grins and lets out a loud whistle and the savages all remove their rags. The chief says;

Very Well. I sentence you to death... by Mokoko.",What is your decision; Mokoko or death?,4

Unfortunately, it has the adverse effect of slowly putting the local florists out of business.  The local florists, knowing the friars will care about the community members, go up to the friars and ask if they'll stop. And!... It doesn't work. The friars basically tell the florists to shove off.

In a final, desperate attempt to save the local florists businesses, all of the florists get together and hire a gentleman from the town mafioso named Hue to go teach the friars a lesson. And he does. And the friars close up shop. And the local florist's businesses are saved!

RE: Christmas Party

I‚Äôm happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the private function room at the Grill House. There will be a cash bar and plenty of drinks! We‚Äôll have a small band playing traditional carols‚Ä¶ please feel free to sing along. And don‚Äôt be surprised if the CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus!

A Christmas tree will be lit at 1pm. Exchange of gifts among employees can be done at that time; however, no gift should be over $10 to make the giving of gifts easy for everyone‚Äôs pockets. This gathering is only for employees!
The CEO will make a special announcement at the Party.

Merry Christmas to you and your family.

Happy Holidays to you and your family.

But you know tomatoes have feelings, too. They scream when you slice them. I‚Äôve heard them scream. I‚Äôm hearing them scream right NOW !!

I hope you all have a rotten holiday, The Bitch from HELL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The man accepts, makes himself comfortable and the hooker turns off the lights and begins to give him the blowjob, while she starts to sing La Marseillaise with a clear and beautiful voice.

This is the best and the most special blowjob the man had ever been given , but the curiosity was too strong : was there another woman singing in the room? Is it a recording? In that case, does she have a recording of every song in the world? 
Eventually,  the man yielded to the temptation of discovering the truth and turned on the lights.

The next day, she showed one of her colleagues what she had been working on - A high-tech sex toy she called the HoverDildo‚Ñ¢.

""How does it work?"" the colleague asked.

""Well,"" said the engineer, ""Like most smart devices, you first say its name to activate it. Then, once it's on, you just tell it where you want it to go! Watch...""

She placed the toy on the table and called out;

""HoverDildo!"" 

There was a little chime sound.

""My vagina!""

The device didn't even wait for her to drop trou. It lifted itself off the table and flew right up the woman's skirt, slithering its way into her crotch! It pounded and vibrated like no human member could as the lady engineer fell to the floor, squirming with pleasure.

""Whoa, that's insane!"" her colleague said. ""But... How do you turn it off?""

A wave of shock filled the engineer's mind. She was so tired from working all night that she forgot to program an off command! So she decided to hide in the janitor's closet until the thing ran out of power...

Hours passed. She couldn't stand it anymore. The boss noticed his top engineer had just disappeared, and he was getting suspicious. He started checking all over the building until he found her in the closet, writhing and exhausted, in a puddle of her own mess.

""WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS!?"" he bellowed, his voice full of rage.

Hi Fred, 
This is Alan next door. I have a confession to make.
 I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to get the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling you in a text message as I can't live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.
 The truth is I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around, in fact, probably more than you. I haven't been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse, I know.
 The temptation was just too much.
 I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. It won't happen again.
 Please suggest a fee for usage and I'll pay you. 
 Regards, 
 Alan.
 
Fred, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, walked next door and shot his neighbor dead. 
Returning home, he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. Then he took out his phone and saw he had a second text message from his neighbor, Alan.

Soon everyone had exited the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seeming oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.

So Satan walked up to the old man and said, ""Don't you know who I am?"" The man replied, ""Yep, sure do.""

""Aren't you afraid of me?"" Satan asked.

""Nope, sure ain't,"" said the man.

""Don't you realize I can kill you with a word?"" asked Satan.

""Don't doubt it for a minute,"" returned the old man, in an even tone.

""Did you know that I could cause you profound, horrifying, physical AGONY... for all eternity?"" persisted Satan.

""Yep,"" was the calm reply.

""And you're still not afraid?"" asked Satan.

""Nope.""

More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, ""Well, why aren't you afraid of me?!""

The son chopped wood


The father built the family home


The son helped expand it


The father did many manual labor jobs to feed the family


The son sacrificed schooling to help at these jobs


The father and son did everything together


They slowly scavenged a collection of tools over the years and were able to start a repair shop


The shop did well


They were able to get a supplier for parts


They sold parts and services out of their home until they could afford to rent a small space 

downtown


They called it Ben and Jerry's repair shop.


They made the sign out of wood carvings from the very first tree they chopped down together.


Things were going well.


The son Jerry even met a girl.


He had very little spare time to be with her, but he tried his best.


She ended up leaving him as she felt abandoned more often than not.


Jerry became very depressed and the business reflected that.


The father Ben was aging and couldn't do as much.

Business faltered, shop bills racked up, medical bills, and stress mounted.

Jerry felt responsible, but couldn't pick up the slack.


As strong a reputation as the shop had, a few months of his depression really had them behind on everything.


In his mind, it was his fault and he only saw one way out.


He had a simple plan.


He had to collect life insurance on his own killing.


Jerry hired a local criminal to pretend to rob the shop, and purposely kill him in the process.


The day came and the criminal showed up.


Jerry was ready to play the part. Ben was to be out of town.


Things went awry. The criminal showed up and Jerry noticed Ben in the back room when he was 

supposed to be home.


The criminal panicked and shot both of them dead.


Just at that moment, Jerry's recent girlfriend walked in to see the tragedy.


The criminal ran out.


Jerry's girlfriend screamed. A scream you don't forget.


And you know what they say, ""You scream. Ice cream.""


She used the insurance money to found Ben and Jerry's Ice cream.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.",Peter and the elephant,8

As he is standing there, looking around at the beauty of the early morning, he notices a lever sticking out of the ground. After a few moments, he walks over, walks all the way around, and then reaches out to grasp the lever. Just as he does, he hears a voice say, ""Don't touch that lever.""
The driver jumps about two feet off the ground, and as he comes down, he looks around. No one is to be seen. Thinking it was just his imagination, he again reaches for the lever. Again the voice yells, ""I said don't touch that lever!"" Being more prepared, the driver senses the location of the voice and looks down under a sage brush. There he sees a small snake.
The driver, in much astonishment, said, ""Was that you that just spoke?""
The snake said, ""Yes. I have to keep people from touching that lever. If the lever is moved, it will be the end of the world.""
The driver, still rather astonished, said, ""What is your name? And will you talk on TV?"" The snake said his name was Nate and that he wasn't interested in going on TV; anyway, he had to stay and watch the lever to see that it wasn't moved. The driver said, ""Look, I will get the networks to send out camera crews. That way, you can inform the entire world about the danger of the lever.""
Nate thought that over and allowed as how there was a great deal of sense to the idea. The driver, true to his word, got the network camera crews out. They put on broadcasts in which Nate warned the entire world of the dangers of moving the lever.
A few weeks later, another truck driver was going through the area. He was following an oil tanker, and the tanker sprang a leak. When the driver's truck hit the slick, it went out of control, and he found himself headed straight for the lever. He remembered seeing Nate on the TV telling about the lever and so he knew that if he hit it, he would cause the world to end. He strove, with all his might to maneuver the truck. Finally, at the last moment, he was able to swerve, but he ran over Nate, the snake, and killed him flat!
The truck driver was heard to say ""Well, better Nate than lever.""","A truck driver is heading west across the Arizona desert. He has been driving all night, and as the sun starts to rise, he feels the need to stop and commune with nature.",11

The Irishman then handed his drink back to the attendant and said, ""Me, too, I didn't know we had a choice.""",A Morman and
