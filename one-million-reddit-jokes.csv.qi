As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare one.

""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" 

I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the Indian waiter's fly. Looking around, I saw that all of the Indian waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So, before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly!"" Then the Indian waiter lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also learned that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our you-know-what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 56.39%.""

I asked quietly, ""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

""Well,"" he whispered,  ""I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.""",One fine night at an Indian restaurant,13
post,5juq6q,2qh72,jokes,false,1482460832,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5juq6q/funny_neil_armstrong_joke/,self.jokes,,"When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous ""One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind"" statement, but followed it by several remarks, including the usual COM traffic between him, the other astronauts, and Mission Control. Before he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.""
Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, they found there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.
Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky"" statement meant. On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26- year-old question to Armstrong. He finally responded. It seems that Mr. Gorsky had died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question. When he was a kid, Neil was playing baseball with his brother in the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front of his neighbors' bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, he heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, ""Oral sex? Oral sex you want? You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!""",Funny Neil Armstrong joke,7

In the third, everything had just been reduced by 50 percent, when her mobile phone rang.
It was a female doctor notifying her that her husband had just been in a terrible car accident and was in critical condition and in the ICU.
The woman told the doctor to inform her husband where she was and that she'd be there as soon as possible. As she hung up she realized she was leaving what was shaping up to be her best day ever in the boutiques... She decided to get in a couple of more shops before heading to the hospital.
She ended up shopping the rest of the morning, finishing her trip with a cup of coffee and a beautiful chocolate cake slice, compliments of the last shop. She was jubilant.
Then she remembered her husband. Feeling guilty, she dashed to the hospital. She saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about her husband's condition. The lady doctor glared at her and shouted, ""You went ahead and finished your shopping trip didn't you! I hope you're proud of yourself! While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself in town, your husband has been languishing in the Intensive Care Unit! It's just as well you went ahead and finished, because it will more than likely be the last shopping trip you ever take! For the rest of his life he will require round-the-clock care.

Without hesitation, the man pulled out five thousand pounds and gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left.

The next night, the man appeared again, once more demanding to see Valerie. Valerie explained that no one had ever come back two nights in a row, as she was so expensive.
There were no discounts. The price was still ￡5000. Again, the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left.

The following night the man was there yet again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie and they went upstairs.

After their session, the man asked Valerie to sign a receipt that she had received ￡15000. She was astonished nevertheless signed on the receipt and said to the man, “No one has ever been with me three nights in a row and for sure this is the first time anyone has asked me to sign a receipt.

The man replied, “Edinburgh.”

“Really”, she said. “I have family in Edinburgh .”

“I know.” the man said.

Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

Hold on the that fee, Ling""","Last month, an Asain family moved in across the street",1

Eventually, looking to seal the deal on his article, he finds himself deep in the rural countryside. He visited a local farmer, who gladly obliged to tell some tales after he heard about the article. The journalist began: ""So, has anything around here ever occurred that made you happy?""

""Yep!"" the farmer said as he mused to himself for a moment, ""Oh! One time, my neighbor's daughter, a good-lookin' lady, got lost. We formed a posse, and found her. After we all fucked her, we took her home.""

""Wait, what??"" The journalist paused in shock, ""Sir, you understand I can't write something like that? Okay... Look tell me about something that was challenging that occurred here, for example.""

Sure enough, there was a police check point on the way home, and since it was a cab, they waved it past. I arrived home safely without incident.

How are you? How is Mrs. Claus? I hope everyone, from the 
reindeer to the elves, is fine. I have been a very good boy this year. I would like an X-Box 360 with Call of Duty IV and an iPhone 
4 for Christmas. I hope you remember that come Christmas Day.

Merry Christmas,

Timmy Jones

* *

Dear Timmy,

Thank you for you letter. Mrs. Claus, the reindeer and the elves are all fine and thank you for asking about them. Santa is a little worried all the time you spend playing video games and texting. Santa wouldn't want you to get fat. Since you have indeed been a good boy, I think I'll bring you something you can go outside and play with.*

Merry Christmas,*

Santa Claus***

* *
Mr. Claus,

Seeing that I have fulfilled the ""naughty vs. Nice"" contract,
set by you I might add, I feel confident that you can see your way clear to granting me what I have asked for. I certainly wouldn't want to turn this joyous season into one of litigation. Also, don't you think that a jibe at my weight coming from an overweight man who goes out once a year is a bit trite?

Respectfully,

Tim Jones

* *

Mr. Jones,

While I have acknowledged you have met the ""nice"" criteria, 
need I remind you that your Christmas list is a request and in no way is it a guarantee of services provided. Should you wish to pursue legal action, well that is your right. Please know, however, that my attorney's have been on retainer ever since the Burgermeister Meisterburger incident and will be 
more than happy to take you on in open court. Additionally, the exercise I alluded to will not only improve your health, but also improve your social skills and potentially help clear up a complexion that looks like the bottom of the Burger King fry bin most days.

Very Truly Yours,

S Claus

* *

Now look here Fat Man,

I told you what I want and I expect you to bring it. I was 
attempting to be polite about this but you brought my looks and my friends into this. Now you just be disrespecting me. I'm about to tweet my boys and we're gonna be waiting for your fat ass and I'm taking my game console, my game, my phone, and whatever else I want. WHAT EVER I WANT, MAN!

T-Bone

* *

Listen Pizza Face,

Seriously??? You think a dude that breaks into every house in the world on one night and never gets caught sweats a skinny G-banger wannabe? ""He sees you when you're sleeping; He knows when you're awake"". Sound familiar, genius? You know what kind of resources I have at my disposal. I got your shit wired, Jack. I go all around the world and see ways to hurt people that if I described them right now, you'd throw up your Totino's pizza roll all over the carpet of your mom's basement. You're not getting what you
asked for, but I'm still stopping by your crib to stomp a mud hole in you're ass and then walk it dry. Chew on that, Petunia.

S Clizzy

Dear Santa,

Bring me whatever you see fit. I'll appreciate anything.

Timmy

Every month, the Burger King Corporation throws a cheerio employee of the month party. It's always been Honey Nut's dream to go, but Fruity always gets to go. Every. Damn. Month. But not this month- No. This is Honey Nut's chance. And the party's in one week. Our boy Honey Nut works extra hard this month. Washing two times the tables and taking two times the orders, this man is destined for a party.

On Wednesday-the party is on Friday-Honey's boss comes up to him and says, ""Honey Nut! I have great news! Your hard work and dedication has paid off. You get to go to the CHEERIO OF THE MONTH PARTY!!!!!""

""Seriously?"" Honey Nut replies. ""This is fantastic!""

So Honey puts on his Sunday best and goes on his way to the party. When he arrives, he is instantly taken away by this smokin' hot babe frosted Cheerio. Now Honey Nut is a pretty confident dude, despite working at burger king, so he goes to talk to her.

""Hey, my name's Honey Nut, and-"" Suddenly he's cut off by her. She says (insert Valley Girl voice) ""Oh, I only talk to Frosted cheerios."" 

Honey Nut is crushed. He just goes to his table and drinks milk until he's extremely drunk. I mean, what else would you expect a piece of cereal to drink? 

So half a month goes by, and Honey Nut is working harder than ever, cause that's all he knows how to do. One day, his boss comes up to him and says, ""Honey. Have I got the opportunity of a lifetime for you. We just got this machine installed that will frost you. You get the chance to become FROSTED!!!!""

Honey Nut steps into the machine and gets-drumroll please- frosted! So he gets invited to the party, and sees the same babe cheerio. They start talking and she actually gives him her time. She seems interested and they talk for so long. After a while, she gets thirsty so he offers to get her a drink. He goes to get her milk, but the line was too long. He went to get her coffee, but the line was out the door. Then he went to get her some punch and guess what? There was no punchline.


Oops.

Finally, he’s on the second floor in the kitchen, he looks out the window and sees a guy sitting in a Volkswagen. “That’s him,” the guy thinks. “That’s the guy who’s been sleeping with my wife!” He’s so furious, he picks up the refrigerator, throws it out the window, has a heart attack, and dies.


St. Peter meets him at the gates of Heaven. “Why are you here?” he asks and the guy answers, “I knew my wife was cheating on me so I came home early. I saw her boyfriend sitting in his Volkswagen out on the street, threw the refrigerator at him, had a heart attack, and died.” St. Peter scowls and says, “You don’t belong here.

The rabbit checks and is disappointed to see no work is available for him. He thanks the barman and leaves.

The rabbit returns the next day, at the same time, and asks the bartender,again, if he knows of any jobs available. The barman directs the rabbit to the same board as before and watches as the rabbit checks and then leaves disappointed.

The same thing happens every single day at the same time for weeks and weeks, until one day, very early in the morning, a young man enters the bar and starts a conversation with the barman.

'Hello there, I am new to the area and I am hoping you may be able to help me. I am directing a modern reselling of the movie, Watership Down and I am looking to cast dozens of rabbits is multiple roles. Do you know of any?'

'Funny you should ask, there's a rabbit that comes in every morning, and asks for jobs. He'll be here in about 20 minutes if you want to wait?'

The man agrees and waits until the rabbit arrives. The two of them then engage in conversation for several minutes before the man leaves looking confused and the rabbit approaches the barman shaking his head, disappointed once again.

'What's up? I thought you would be a shoo in for a job with that guy, he had loads of jobs for rabbits!?' Says the barman.

'Well, he did' replies the rabbit. ' But i'm not an actor, i'm an electrician!'

In the commotion following the surprise landing, all three of them passed out from the alcohol.

The following day, all three of them woke up in the the guest room of the presidential palace.

When they left the room, they were escorted by North Korean women in traditional outfits to the presidential dining room.

There in the dining room, eating a bowl of Booty'Os was none other than the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un himself.

""Good morning,"" The North Korean Leader looked up from his cereal, ""Welcome to North Korea.""

Obama, Clinton and Trump started to realise at this moment that they have fucked up.

""Please have a seat,"" The North Korean Leader gestured, ""It is not every day we have honored guests such as you three.""

The three of them nervously took a seat at the table.

As soon as they sat down, the North Korean servers placed bowls of cereals in front of them.

""Please, eat."" The North Korean Leader smiled at his guests, ""I don't like to talk business on an empty stomach""

Obama, Clinton and Trump nervously started to eat their bowl of cereal.

Except for the occasional clanging of a spoon hitting a bowl and the sound of muffled munching, it was awkwardly quiet in that room.

When they finished, the servers came in and cleared the table.

Kim Jong-un looked around the table as Obama, Clinton and Trump nervously avoided eye contact with him.

""I am not booty."" The North Korean Leader suddenly said, ""I will give you a chance to leave North Korea alive.""

""Anything!"" Clinton exclaimed, ""I'll do anything!""

""I'll pay you!"" Trump intervened, ""I'll finish your hotel for you for free! I'll even send my son over to manage it!""

""With all due respect Mr Kim,"" Obama said calmly, ""Will you two please shut the fuck up!"" As he glared at Clinton and Trump.

""You were talking about a chance Mr Kim,"" Obama continued, ""Please elaborate.""

""A contest, Mr Obama."" The Leader explained, ""If you win. I let you leave.""

""Alive?""

""Alive.""

""And the media?""

""You landed a fucking jumbo jet literally in my backyard,"" The Leader pointed to the window, ""it is best the media be kept in the dark.""

The three of them stretched their necks and saw Air Force One majestically sitting in a grass field surrounded by millitary personnel.

They looked at each other and nodded.

""Mr Kim,"" Obama continued, ""What do you propose?""

""A dick measuring contest."" The Leader smiled.

""What?""

""A literal dick measuring contest. We measure our penises.""

""Okay.....""

""If the length of all three of your penises combined is longer than the length of my penis, I let you go.""

""All three?""

""Yes. All three.""

The three of them looked at each other.

A smile formed on Obama's face,  Clinton looked relaxed but Trump was looking a bit more nervous.

""Mr Kim, we accept."" Obama spoke confidently.

""I knew you would!"" Kim Jong-un replied joyfully, ""Bring out the presidential ruler!""

The presidential ruler was laid on the dining table.

""Let the measuring begin!"" The Leader exclaimed.

The leader stepped up to the table and began unzipping his pants.

""Let me show you why they call me Glorious Leader,"" he smirked.

With a resounding thud, The Leader dropped his pants and laid his thick girthy veiny penis on the table.

""Twent mother-fucking inches bitches!"" The Leader pronounced proudly, ""Believe that, babygirl.""

Obama's jaw dropped.  Clinton was gobsmacked.  Trump slumped in his chair.

Obama looked at Clinton and Trump, ""Don't worry. We've got this.""

He stepped up to the table as The Leader struggled to get his python back into his pants.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you, PotPotUS.""

Obama dropped his pants and laid his penis on the table.

""Eleven inches bitch."" Obama smiled at Clinton and Trump. ""We've got this.""

A smile began to form on Clinton's face.  Trump still looked worried.

""My turn!"" Clinton gleefully said.

Lining up at the table Clinton unleashed a girthy, circumcised veiny penis with a white shaft and a pink head.

""Nine fucking inches baybeeeee!"" Clinton shouted proudly.

""That's twenty inches!"" Obama jumped out of his chair.  ""One more inch and we go home!""

All the eyes in the room were now on Trump.

Trump nervously shuffled to the table and taking deep heavy breaths.

He took one final breath and dropped his pants, his face red with concentration.

""One Inch!"" The entire room shouted in unision.

The Leader fell back to his chair with a defeated look on his face.


As promised, The Leader allowed Obama, Clinton and Trump to leave North Korea.

Later on, in Air Force One, the three of them started to recount the day's events.

""You motherfuckers are alive because of me."" Obama boasted, ""If not for my eleven inches of pure American muscle, we would be dead right now.""

Clinton chimed in, ""Hey, my nine inches also had something to do with it,  unlike someone,"" turning a sarcastic gaze at Trump.

Trump stared at at Clinton and suddenly exploded, ""Shut the fuck up Hillary! If I didn't have a hard-on, we'd be dead.""","Obama, Clinton and Trump were flying in Air Force One.",5

But after working out for two hours a day, with five-gram weights, and getting a degree in economics, *wa-zaam!* he was an orange fruit loop.  But he was still hungry.

Again Looking at himself in the mirror, he said, ""I need to become a yellow fruit loop.""  It was a daunting task, but after working out for two-and-a-half hours a day, with five-gram weights, and getting a phD in physics, *wa-zaam!* he was a yellow fruit loop.  But he was still hungry.

Looking at himself in the mirror once again, he said, ""I need to become a green fruit loop.""  It was certainly a daunting task.  But green fruit loops lived a lavish life, with multiple cars and big houses.  Simply put, he couldn't pass up the opportunity.  But their was a risk: humans loved green fruit loops.  Accepting the risk, he worked three hours a day, with five-gram weights, and became a famous musician.  *Wa-zaam!*  He was now a green fruit loop.  But somehow, despite his now-lavish lifestyle, he was still hungry.

So, looking at himself in the mirror one day, he said, ""I need to become a blue fruit loop.""  Yes, that's right, a blue fruit loop: the highest honor in all the lands.  It took hard, hard work, and was a very daunting task indeed.  And there was a risk: humans love, love blue fruit loops.  But he was on a mission, and was committed on becoming a blue fruit loop, whatever it would take.  He worked out six-hours a day, with ten-gram weights.  He studied law and decided to run for president.  He was a poet, an artist, a musician, a scientist, and a scholar.  He even read some old Reddit post about the steps needed to become a monk and took seven years becoming that, too.  And on Election Day, *wa-zaam!*  he won the presidency, and became a blue fruit loop.  He now had the best lifestyle achievable.  He had was admired throughout the lands, was the president U.S.F.L. (United States of Fruit Loops), and had a beautiful family.  So one day, he decided to celebrate with his family, and take his sons, Jake and Jim (two red fruit loops) to an amusement park.  They had a blast.  They tried all the games, slid down all the slides, and went on all the roller-coasters.  But it was a hot day, and at the end of all the fun, Jake and Jim were both exhausted and dehydrated.  ""Can we go get some water, Dad?"" they asked their blue-fruit-loop-father.  ""Sure, go ahead"" their blue-fruit-loop-father replied.  A few minutes later, Jake and Jim came back, with no water.  ""The water line is really long"" they said.  ""Can we go get some lemonade?""  ""Sure,"" their father replied.  But again they returned, with no lemonade.  ""The lemonade line is really long too!"" they exclaimed.  ""Can we go get some fruit punch?""  ""Sure."" their father replied.  But at that very instant, a big fan of their father pulled him aside.  ""You know, you are the only fruit loop to ever achieve blue status."" the fan said, shaking with excitement.  ""What's your secret to success?""

But at that very instant, his sons returned, both with gleaming smiles and fruit punches.  ""Great news!"" they told their father.  ""There is no punch line.""

When she goes to he city, she comes back very late and is supposedly out with some good friends from her working place who I don’t know.
I always stay awake at night and stand on the balcony, waiting for the cab that brings her home again. But every time she walks around the corner, I can hear the car, but never see it. How so? Because it may not be a taxi??

I think she is cheating on me...
Everytime I address it to her, she blocks off immediatly. I wanted to know the truth and last night when she was out again I wanted to check it out this time when she came home.

I had an idea.
I parked my car just at the corner, where her ""cab"" always delivered her. At first I wanted to sit in the car and hide myself, but maybe she would have discovered me too easily. So I was ducking behind my car and waited for her to come back and I noticed that the rear right fender had a little bit of rust on it.

They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about. Until one day...

For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover.

In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000.

He asked her about the contents.
'When we were married,' she said, 'my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.'

The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with happiness.

'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the dolls, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?'

So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."".

""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering.""
The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.



That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields.
""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".



""Okay."" replies the dog, ""You have nine hundred sheep.""",A farmer has 895 sheep.,30394

- What exactly do you intend to study?
- I'm not quite sure. What do you have to teach me?
- Well, we have math, history, literature and logic.
- Logic??? Never heard of that. 
- Let me explain what logic is. Billy, do you have a rake?
- Hell yeah i do! I rake'em leaves all day long.
- Well, logically if you have a rake then you probably have a yard.
- Hell yeah i have a yard! I walk on that yard all day.
- Well, logically if you have a yard then you probably have a house.
- Yes... yes sure. I do have a house. I live in that house for 10 years already.
- Well, logically if you have a house then you probably have a wife and kids.

The journalist opens the towering door and is met by a priest.

Priest: why are you here my child.

Journalist: I would like to know more about the church.

The priest agrees to give him a tour of the church.
The journalist is shown through every room, every nook and every cranny. Everywhere except a trap door located on the ceiling.

Curiosity gets the better of him and the journalist asks him what's behind the door.

Priest: I would absolutely tell you my child but you have to be a priest.

Journalist: Well, how do I become a priest?

Priest: You have to experience the worst pain known to man to become a priest.

The journalist goes home trying to push the thought of the trapdoor from his mind.

Eventually, he cannot take it anymore and throws himself in front of a moving car.

He breaks one arm and one leg.

He returns to the priest, telling him of what he has gone through.

Priest: I'm sorry my child but you still haven't experienced enough pain in order to become a priest. 

The journalist, frustrated, returns home once again trying to force himself to forget about the trap door.

But he cannot forget.

The journalist proceeds to drench himself in petrol and set it on fire.

The pain is excruciating and leaves him with 3rd degree burns.

He returns to the church once more stressing to the priest the pain he has experienced.

Priest: terribly sorry my child but that isn't enough.

The journalist, feeling truly defeated returns home again.

But he cannot forget the trapdoor.

The journalist catches a plane and jumps out with no parachute.

He breaks every single bone in his body and drags himself across the desert until he is greeted by the large doors of the church.

The journalist is welcomed by the priest and tells him through a broken jaw and shattered teeth the pain he has experienced.

Priest: very well my child, you are now a priest, what do you want to do now?

Journalist: I wanna see what's behind the trapdoor!

Priest: then I will show you my child please follow me. 

The priest walks to a cupboard and pulls out a large ladder.

He props it against the trap door, as he begins to climb.

The journalist struggles to follow him as they finally reach the top.

The door opens revealing everything inside...

I would tell you but you have to be a priest.

If you know anything about the book, it's slightly darker than the film. But, the problem for the Archdeacon is the same; the bells need to get rung, and he very well isn't going to ring them himself, so he puts out a notice that he's looking for a replacement for the dead hunchback. 

Frollo was nothing if not a bastard at heart, and decided to himself that it should be another freak of nature, a man or woman who did not belong in proper society that should take up the job cloistered up in the belltower. Food and lodgings would be provided, and one of the vermin the Archdeacon hated so much would be off the streets. Frollo's notice was a big hit, as many, many people wanted to have the honored position of bellringer of the bells of Notre Dame. Up from the top, Archdeacon Claude Frollo could see the line wrapped around the church, all people wanting the job desperately. 

One by one, they climbed up, up, up the winding stairs of the church of Notre Dame to meet the Archdeacon of the church Claude Frollo and audition as bellringer. One by one, they descended back down the winding stairs of the church of Notre Dame after the Archdeacon of the church Claude Frollo turned them away for either being too normal or an insufficient musical talent for such a prestigious position as the bellringer at the church of Notre Dame. The sun was getting lower little by little and Frollo was starting to give up hope. If he didn't find them by the end of the day today, he'd have to start all over tomorrow, or perhaps even have to ring the bells himself which was quite out of the question. 

A man shambled to the top of the stairs and Frollo turned around. 

""I'm here to audition,"" he said, and Frollo took stock of him. He was average height, average build, with a smiling face and, Frollo noticed, no arms. The Archdeacon of the church of Notre Dame Claude Frollo laughed for the first time in many years. 

""Thank you for lightening my spirits,"" he said, ""but you have no arms to ring the bells with. I am sorry only that you had to climb all this way for such a joke.""

""No, please,"" the man begged, ""let me show you. I can play the bells""

Frollo stepped aside with his arms crossed and waited. The man stepped forward, pulled his head back, and slammed into the first bell with his forehead. Down the row he went and back again, playing a tune that Frollo once knew when he was a much younger man. Even his icy heart started to melt a little. The playing was perfect, and this armless man had full control of everything from the volume of each bell to the length the note was held with only his head striking them. Frollo grabbed him by the shoulder and wiped a tear from his eye. He led the man to the window overlooking the entire city, the window that would be this man's view for as long as he served as the bellringer at the church of Notre Dame.

""Son, you have done me a great service, and will do this city an even greater one. Truly, you are the most talented musician in generations to grace our church. I am glad my search found you.""

And Archdeacon Claude Frollo clapped the main on the back, giddy that his long day had yielded results. Now, there was only one problem. Without arms to steady himself, what Archdeacon Frollo thought was a gentle pat on the back actually sent this armless man teetering towards the window. Before Frollo knew what had happened, the man fell down, down, down the belltower to the streets of Notre Dame. Frollo let out an ungodly shriek and sprinted down the spiral stairs to get to the ground. 

Out the front door of the church he flew, where a crowd had already gathered around the man who had fallen down from the belltower of the church of Notre Dame, dead and splattered on the ground. 

""Oh, Archdeacon Frollo, Archdeacon Frollo!"" Shouted a woman. ""This man, he fell from above! From the belltower of the church of Notre Dame! Archdeacon Frollo, who is this man?""

""Well, I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell.""

Archdeacon Claude Frollo rang the bells himself the next morning grumpily. He'd lost his golden goose, and needed to find another. So he put out another notice for the next afternoon, requesting that anyone interested, even those who had already auditioned, return and try again. He looked out from the top of the tower at the line already forming, even in the early hours of the morning. Surely one of these men or women would be a suitable replacement. 

""Archdeacon Frollo,"" said one of the deacons, ""there is a man here, insistent to see you. He says it cannot wait.""

Frollo turned around and saw a perfectly normal man with an odd resemblance to his armless casualty the day before. With the arms, he didn't quite fit the bill Frollo was looking for. But before Archdeacon Frollo of the church of Notre Dame could speak, this man started weeping openly.

""What's the matter?"" The Archdeacon asked. 

""The man yesterday who tragically fell to his death was my brother Archdeacon Frollo. My own brother. His only wish was to ring the bells of Notre Dame. Musical talent runs in our family, and despite my own occupation as a cobbler, I wish now to take up his place and serve this great church of Notre Dame.""

Frollo decides, just this once, to make an exception, and see if this man truly does have the talent his brother had. He sent the deacons away, and gestured for this new audition to begin. And begin it did; the man played with inhuman grace, better even than his brother, and Frollo felt a tear prick the corner of his eye. This was it. This was the future of the church of Notre Dame. Frollo clapped despite himself, and the man pulled his arm back to strike the bell a final time, the end to his song. 

Suffice to say, the final blow never came. The man clutched his chest, gasping for air, and dropped to his knees. Frollo ran to him, but felt no pulse even seconds later. He died there, in the belltower of the church of Notre Dame, at the side of Archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo let out another inhuman shriek, and the deacons came running. 

""Archdeacon Frollo, what is the matter-oh, God almighty! What happened to this man? What was the name of the man that needed to see you so urgently and died here in our own belltower in the church of Notre Dame?""

""I never learned his name, but he's a dead ringer for his brother.""

The professor said to just let him be for now. Again another moderator saw him cheating and told the professor, once again the professor told him to not do anything yet.
So after a long time almost all the students were gone until the guy who was cheating was one of the last ones left. All the moderators watched him cheat the whole time. Eventually the professor dismissed the moderators. And finally the students came to turn in the paper.

""You don't expect me to accept that sir"" said the professor.

""Why not?""said the student.

And the professor said ""You cheated on it""

""No I didn't"" said the student

""We watched  you cheating the whole time.""

""Do you even know who I am?"" said the student

""No?""

""Good!"" 

Then the student took the stack of test on the professors desk, places his test in between them, and threw all the papers on the floor. Then he sprinted out of the hall.",Cheating at a College Exam,23

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."" The father says, ""Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."" The little boy replies, ""Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in Deep Shit.”","A young boy asks his dad, ""What are politics?""",121

The curious boy asks them what dicks and pussies are. The man, trying to make up an excuse, says “er….they're others names for men and women”.

The boy continues home and passes a pharmacy which says ‘Condoms for sale inside’. The boy goes in and asks what a condom is. Again, trying to find a euphemism, the clerk says “um….it's a type of hat.”

The boy gets home. As the family is expecting visitors his Mum is putting makeup on. She smudges a bit and says “Shit!” The child asks what that means. Realising her mistake, the Mum hastily says “Oh it's….another name for makeup”.

The boy’s father is cooking a chicken for the guests, and he accidentally burns himself. He shouts “Fuck!” Again the boy asks what that word means. The father says “well…it means to cook”.

Anyway, the guests have arrived and as his parents are busy, the young boy opens the door and says:

2. Pick up the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.

3. In one smooth movement put the cat in the toilet and close the lid. You may need to stand on the lid.

4. At this point the cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from the toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this!

5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a 'Power Wash' and 'Rinse'.

6. Have someone open the front door of your home. Be sure that there are no people between the toilet and the front door.

7. Stand well back, behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift the lid.

8. The cat will rocket out of the lid, streak through the bathroom, and run outside where he will dry himself off.

9. Both the toilet and the cat will be sparkling clean.



Yours Sincerely,

The Dog

He had posters of tractors all over his bedroom wall, tractor themed pyjamas, and tons of tractor toys.


When he was 12, his dad let him drive a tractor for the very first time, but he fell off as soon as he started the engine and hurt himself pretty badly. He recovered alright, but lost all his love for tractors. He ripped down all his posters and threw all his tractor toys away.


Many years later, and now a fully grown man, he was having a nice drink with his pals in the local pub. Unfortunately, the pub was also full of smokers who were lighting up so much that the whole pub soon became full of smoke.


His friends complained about the amount of smoke, but he knew what to do. ""Give me one minute"", he said before sucking in repeatedly through his mouth. Soon enough, he had collected all the smoke into his cheeks. He then went outside, and blew it all out. The pub was now completely smoke free.


""How did you do that?"", his friends asked with amazement. ""Simple"", he replied, ""I'm an extractor fan"".",A boy who loved tractors,0

Before i could even get in the van we started getting hot and heavy while i was fumbling for my keys and before i knew it we were going at it up against the door. In a fit of passion she broke the antenna off and started whipping my ass with it while shouting ""harder, harder!"". It was the craziest sex i'd ever had and i never even found out her name.

A few days afterwards i noticed that i still had big angry red welts all over my ass and decided to go see the doctor.

At first i was a bit reluctant to admit what had happened, but eventually i confessed about my wild sex adventure with a stranger.

The doctor nodded and said ""Just as i thought. This is the worst case of van aerial disease i've ever seen""",A night at the club,2

The first son takes his duck to the market, and after an hour of haggling manages to sell it for £50.

The second son decides to take his time in this endeavour, and thus waits until Chinese New Year. He then goes to an expensive Chinese restaurant and manages to sell his duck for £75, confident that he will have won.

Finally, the third son starts looking around, but can't find anywhere that will take it for more than £10. He decides that he can't be arsed with it and goes to his local brothel. He asks if he can pay for sex with his duck, and the prostitute agrees. After they finish up the first time, the prostitute says 
""I don't normally like doing it with the guys I get paid by, but that was a lot of fun. I'll give you the duck back if we do it again""
So they go at it again, and just as the third son is putting his trousers back on the duck flies out of the window and gets hit by a limousine.

He sprints out of the brothel and a rich Canadian tourist steps out of the limousine and asks if that was his duck. The son says yes, and the Canadian says
""Oh my I'm so sorry, here this should cover it"" and hands him $200.

All pleased with their work, the three children go to their dad and he proceeds to asks them what they got.

The first child says, ""I got £50 at the market.""

The second child says ""I got £75 at a Chinese restaurant.""

The third child says ""I got a fuck for a duck and a duck for a fuck and two hundred bucks for a fucked up duck.""",An old businessmen is dying and decides to write his will... [Long],126

Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries. Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go?

As you well know, some of us have been known to have had brushes with the authorities on our way home from the occasional social session - especially during the Holidays. A couple of nights ago I was out for an evening with friends, and had a couple of cocktails and some rather ice cold adult beverages.
Knowing full well I may have been slightly over the limit, I did something I've never done before. I took a cab home. And wouldn't you just know it - on the way home I passed a police road block but, since it was a cab, they waved it past. I arrived home safely and without incident - which was a real surprise because I have never driven a cab before and am not sure where I got it or what to do with it now that it's in my garage.
Be careful out there.",Drive safe this holiday season,1

post,5jhqm4,2qh72,jokes,false,1482290855,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5jhqm4/pranking/,self.jokes,,"Yesterday my daughter e-mailed me again, asking why I didn't do something useful with my time.
“Like sitting around the pool and drinking wine is not a good thing?” I asked.

Talking about my ""doing-something-useful"" seems to be her favorite topic of conversation.  She was ""only thinking of me"", she said and suggested that I go down to the Senior Center and hang out with others my age.

I did this and when I got home last night, I decided to play a prank on her. I emailed her and told her that I had joined a Parachute Club.

She replied, ""Are you nuts?  You are 78 years old and now you're going to start jumping out of airplanes?""

I told her that I even got a Membership Card and emailed a copy to her.

She immediately telephoned me and yelled, ""Good grief, Mom, where are your glasses?!  This is a membership to a Prostitute Club, not a Parachute Club.""

""Oh man, I'm in trouble again,” I said, “I really don't know what to do. I signed up for five jumps a week!!""

The line went quiet and her friend picked up the phone and said that my daughter had fainted.

Life as a Senior Citizen is not getting any easier, but sometimes it can be a lot of fun.

Sarah gives Lisa a box of nails. Lisa opens the box, and begins taking out nails for the floorboard.

Lisa throws nail after nail after nail away. In the 15 minutes she was working, she seemed to get absolutely no work done.

Sarah, the other blonde, notices this strange behavior, and questions her coworker's method of working.

To this Lisa responds ""You bought a horrible box of nails; all of these are either upside down!""

Sarah immediately face palms and yells ""You fucking idiot, why the hell would you throw them away!"" 

Lisa simply shrugs 

Sarah, after get her air back from yelling at Lisa follows herself up with ""Just because they're upside down doesn't mean you can't use them for the ceiling!""

Follow up joke: They really nailed it!

Explaination: The blondes are stereotyped as dumb, and they think the nails that don't face directly down are broken and cannot be used for the floorboards.

Then she suggests using them for the ceiling, because they are turned upwards
