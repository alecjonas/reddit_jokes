“Do you know how fast you were going?” asks the officer.

The old lady gives him a sweet smile. “Officer, I was just going the speed limit. I never went even a smidgen over eighty-four.”

The police officer scratches his head. “Eighty-four? The speed limit here is sixty!”

“Oh, but those lovely signs all up and down the interstate say we should be going 84! But no one else seems to follow them...”

The cop sighs. “Ma’am, that’s the interstate number. You’re on I-84, the speed limit’s on a different sign.”

The officer tells the old lady that she’s free to go, but as he’s turning back to his car he sees two other old women in the backseat. They look shellshocked, one gripping her armrest for dear life, and the other vacantly staring into the distance. 

“Are your passengers all right?” asks the officer.

 The bartender raises his eyebrows, but serves the man three beers, which he drinks quietly at a table, alone.



 An hour later, the man has finished the three beers and orders three more.



 This happens yet again.



 The next evening the man again orders and drinks three beers at a time, several times. Soon the entire town is whispering about the Man Who Orders Three Beers.



 Finally, a week later, the bartender broaches the subject on behalf of the town. ""I don't mean to pry, but folks around here are wondering why you always order three beers?""



 'Tis odd, isn't it?"" the man replies, ""You see, I have two brothers, and one went to America, and the other to Australia. We promised each other that we would always order an extra two beers whenever we drank as a way of keeping up the family bond.""



 The bartender and the whole town was pleased with this answer, and soon the Man Who Orders Three Beers became a local celebrity and source of pride to the hamlet, even to the extent that out-of-towners would come to watch him drink.



 Then, one day, the man comes in and orders only two beers. The bartender pours them with a heavy heart. This continues for the rest of the evening - he orders only two beers. The word flies around town. Prayers are offered for the soul of one of the brothers.



 The next day, the bartender says to the man, ""Folks around here, me first of all, want to offer condolences to you for the death of your brother. You know-the two beers and all...""



 The man ponders this for a moment, then replies, ""You'll be happy to hear that my two brothers are alive and well... It's just that I, myself, have decided to give up drinking for Lent.""

He goes to the nearest village, finds a good woman to marry, and then together they return to his house in the mountain. He was too naive. Everyday in the morning he takes the sheep to the meadow and returns in the evening. Eats dinner and sleeps afterwards. He didn't know that a man and a woman should also have sex with each other. 

After a couple of months his started to neglect the house. She was not really happy there. He started thinking that she was also sick like his parents were so that when his wife asked him to go and visit her mother he gave here permission immediately.

The wife visited her mother and told her the problem. She explained that she was alone the whole day and that in the evening he had no interest into her.

The mother listens and tells the daughter to go back to his husband because things were going to be better. So one night when the shepherd was returning home with the sheep she appeared to him masked as a fairy. 

She tells him that she was a fairy and that she wanted to help him. Then asked him how was his wife, and he responds that she is sick and that he is worried that she might die. She says that she knew a remedy for his wife problem. So she starts explaining him that he had to have sex with her once he goes back home. 

And that's what he did, several times that night..

The next morning he notices his wife is awake before him. She had prepared a very nice breakfast and had already cleaned everything. She was smiling and singing. He had no doubt that she was now recovered.

He sits on the corner and stats crying. His wife goes near him and asked: ""What is the problem honey? I am happy with you, aren't you happy with me?""

He responds: "" I am really happy especially for you that you are now cured just like the Fairy yesterday night told me. Why I am crying is because of my parents that are now dead.

Undaunted, the husband said ""That's OK, Sweetheart"" and spent the full five minutes looking for the ball. He found it just in time but in a horrible position. He played the shot of his life to get the ball within two feet of the hole. He told his wife to knock the ball in.

Still maintaining composure, the husband summoned all of his skill and holed the shot from the bunker.

‘O Chief! Kindly let us go, we were lost in the forest, hungry and thirsty. We mean no harm. Have some mercy on us!’

The chief feels pity and decides to spare their lives on one condition. ‘Go into the forest and bring back any five pieces of fruit. I will stick that fruit up your butt and if you make a single sound, you will be slaughtered right there. And don’t even try to run, my soldiers will be sent along with you to collect the fruit.’

The three friends reluctantly agree. The first one brings back bananas. While the chief is inserting the second fruit, the guy cries out in pain and loses his life.

The second one is confident of making it through since he brought in grapes. And while the last grape is being inserted, the guy suddenly starts laughing and loses his life. Subsequently, the third friend is executed as well.

The three meet at the gates of heaven and the first guy asks the second, ’I cried out in pain, but you laughed! You only had one more grape to go and could have survived, why did you even laugh?’

Still giggling, he replied, ’ Well, I couldn’t control it when i saw our third friend walking in with three watermelons!’

At this point the two men are really intrigued over this large hole. So they look around a little for something bigger to throw in, and they come across a railroad tie. They both grab an end, walk it over to the hole, and throw it in.

The men are looking down the hole when all of a sudden they hear this noise in the woods. They look over and see this goat running all over the place. It’s ziging and zaging between trees and going all over the place. Then it runs right up and dives into the hole.

Now the two men are thinking, what the hell was that? They had no idea what that goat was doing. So they decide to just keep walking.

A little ways down they run into a farmer, and the farmer asks them if they’d seen his goat. The two men tell him that they saw a goat come running out of the woods and jump into this huge hole. But the farmer says that couldn’t have been his, cause he tied his goat to a railroad tie.

post,8wza8f,2qh72,jokes,false,1531026289,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8wza8f/holy_grail/,self.jokes,,"There was once an archeologist on the search for the mythical ""Holy Grail"", he wanted eternal life and was SURE there was truth to the tale. He had hunted for years and found references in ancient documents that pointed to a hint supposedly at a distant burial ground that he could discern only to be deep in the wilderness of an African jungle. To even get to where he was to the mystical burial site he needed to get to Cairo, Egypt then transfer to a small plane to land at a rural airstrip in the middle of nowhere then get a guide to hike him to a small village where he could get a canoe and go upriver to a place not even on the maps, hike for days and find this ancient burial cave. 

There was another reason beyond fame and fortune he wanted to find the Holy Grail.. He had just discovered one other fact.. His nagging cough was not bronchitis, it was cancer. Terminal. He HAD to find the Holy Grail, NO MATTER WHAT.

So he goes through flying to Cairo, charters a small plane, gets a guide from the small airstrip, gets to the village, trades goods for a canoe, and goes entirely off the map to this area of deep wilderness.

He finds the burial grounds and discovers, deep in a cave, a clay pot with a scroll. Translating it he discovers that the Holy Grail is not a gift of immortality, it is four special words spoken by a head monk of a secret convent, passed on from generation to generation over thousands of years, which will give one the necessary holy information to live a long and fruitful life. Four magic words spoken by a monk. But there's a caveat, the monk is only able to give this information on the summer solstice, why not, at sundown from the top of a mountain.. The coordinates of which were described in ancient texts to mysteriously be on the other side of the planet, a place undiscovered at the ancient time of the burial grounds place in history. It was truly divine knowledge.

The Summer Solstice was only one week away! The archeologist had only months to live! He HAD to make it there immediately!

He got in his canoe, fought the river currents, and made it, after two days, to the small village. From there he hired, at a great cost, the same guide that got him back to the airstrip. A pilot happened to be just loading up his small plane, he hitched a ride for a considerable cost and landed in Cairo. From there he booked the first flight to South America.

In Brasília, the capitol of Brazil , he managed to charter a small plane to a rural airstrip, deep within the jungle. From there he hired a guide to get to a small village where he spent the last of his money begging to buy a canoe from locals that didn't have much use for currency. He went far up river and finally, days after his discovery deep in the jungles of Africa, he comes to the base of the fabled mountain.. Just hours before sunset.

Haggard, unshaven, exhausted and already feeling the impacts of terminal cancer, he takes the first steps up the trail. Suddenly a monk steps out of the brush and says, in perfect English (of course), ""You must be the chosen one.""

""Yes! Yes! I am! I must have the Phrase of the Holy Grail! What is it?!""

The monk replies, ""You must prove your worthiness, by sundown you must reach the top of the hill to receive the phrase which will grant you the gift of how to live. There will be three tests along the way. The first is this one, go into the jungle here and find the Umbuto plant. The fruit of it is deadly.""

The monk reaches behind a tree and hands him a pair of large pruning sheers. Rubber handled, sharp, and something you'd find for $39.99 at Home Depot.

""You will need these throughout your quests. Go, cut the fruit from the tree.""

The archeologist quickly runs off and does so. Upon his return the monk quickly hands it to a native that darts from the foliage and disappears just as fast as he came.

""Cutting those berries was your first task of three. They are now being pummeled down to a poisonous juice which will be placed on the darts of the tribe. If you fail at either of the next two trials you will be stricken by many of these darts and die within moments.""

""Hell"", the archeologist thought to himself, ""I'm dead anyway if I don't get there, so, uh, same difference."" He started off without another word, looking to the lowering sun through the jungle.

""Good Luck!"" the monk yelled after him.

After some time fighting through the thick brush, sweat pouring off his body, fighting the heat and exhaustion, he came upon a deep ravine, some 30 foot across. There was no passing it.

Suddenly, completely neat and clean, not a drop of sweat on his brow, the same monk stepped out of the jungle.

""For your second quest you must build a rope ladder from the vines and cross this treacherous ravine.""

The archeologist takes the sheers and deeply determined, heads off into the jungle. He looks to the lowering sun and jumps into action, cutting vines, tying a rock to one, tossing it over the ravine and after a few hours he's built himself a rickity but passable rope bridge out of the vines.

Running now, sprinting and stumbling his way through the jungle, the sheers over his shoulder, he is almost to the top of the mountain. The sun is dipping below the edge of the horizon.. He must make it there in time!

Suddenly he reaches the top, running, out of breath, he looks around, seeing only a barren rock overlooking the jungle landscape.

From behind a boulder the same monk calmly steps out.

""What's my last quest?!"" The archeologist practically screams at the monk.

The monk holds out a simple string, pulled tight, from the thumb and pointer finger of each hand. 

""Cut it.""

The sun was now a sliver on the horizon.

""C--C--Cut the--the--String?""

""Yes.""

As the Sun dipped below the horizon the archeologist reached out with the sheers, hands shaking, and SLICE! the string became two, he cut the length of twine.

There was a moment of quiet, the archeologist dropped the sheers to the rock they were standing on.

""You have passed the three quests and have proven yourself worthy.""

""What.. What is the Holy Grail? What are the four words?"" the archeologist stammered out.

""The four words, which will grant you a long and fulfilling life, are these.""

A deathly silence overtook the mountaintop as the light of the evening faded.

""Don't. Run. With. Scissors.""",Holy Grail,41

“Well “says the man, “I found this magic lamp”Goes back in to the box and pulls out this old brass oil lamp.

“I rubbed it and a genie appeared and granted me one wish and then he said I must pass the lamp on to the next person that did me a kindness”

“Wow” says the barman.

The man then says “as you gave me a drink I’m going to let you have the lamp”

“Be careful what you wish for tho”

So the barman rubs the lamp and then makes his wish………

After years of trying to save money in order to buy one, he finally found a used, vintage Harley-Davidson at a great price. When he saw the motorcycle for the first time, he was stunned because of how clean and bright it was. After finalizing the deal, he asks the previous owner how he managed to preserve the bike in such a good condition. The previous owner replies:

""Look, I will tell you the secret: you don't need to do much. But, every time it rains, you have to run outside as fast as possible and cover the whole motorcycle with Vaseline. Take this jar, it will help you.""

The guy leaves with a jar of Vaseline and the precious advice and heads to his house, where his girlfriend is waiting for him, as he will visit her parents' house for the first time for dinner. While they are on their way to the house on the Harley-Davidson, she warns him:

""My parents are weird with some stuff. For example, during dinner, no one is allowed to talk. No one. We have absolute silence. As a matter of fact, the penalty for the first one who talks, is that he or she has to do the dishes.""

They arrive at the house and, as the front door opens, he sees dirty dishes everywhere. The kitchen is full of dirty dishes, he heads to the living room, he sees dirty dishes, he goes to the room to find dirty dishes all over the place, the whole house has dirty dishes. He is curious, but asks nothing.

Dinner time arrives and he, his girlfriend, her father and her mother sit at the table. They start eating, but nobody talks. Fifteen minutes pass by and he is starting to reach his limit, he realizes that he won't make it, but he can't say anything because of all the dishes. So, he decides to take action.

He heads to his girlfriend, he starts kissing her and then he starts groping her, in front of her parents, who look at them, but don't talk. Then, he puts his girlfriend on the table, takes her clothes off and they start having sex. Both the parents are visibly angry, they sweat, but they say no word at all. 

After finishing with his girlfriend, furious that no one talked, he heads to her mother. She was a nice woman, despite her age she looked great. Same story, he kisses her, starts groping her and, after seeing again that no one would talk, starts having sex with her.

Again no one talked, despite everyone being stunned and furious. Just after they finished, he hears a lightning. He looks out of the window and sees dark clouds gathering outside. At that moment, he remembers the advice about his Harley-Davidson, pulls the jar of Vaseline out of his pocket, so his girlfriend's father gets up terrified and shouts:

""NO, NO, I WILL DO THE DISHES!""","A guy loves motorcycles, especially vintage ones. After years of trying to save money for one, he finally found a used, vintage Harley-Davidson...",142

“I haven’t got that much darling. What can you do for £25?”. So the wife goes back to her husband and asks him. “Well, give him a blowjob for £25”, the husband says.

The wife goes back to the car and gets in with the man. He agrees to go for a blowjob so undoes his trousers and pulls out the biggest penis she’s ever seen. “Excuse me a second”, says the wife, and goes back to her husband.

She is set to go to sleep again, but, aha, you guessed it Robert is back again, rapping on the door and is as fresh as a 25 - year - old, ready for more 'action'. And, once more they enjoy each other.

But as Robert gets set to leave again, his young bride says to him, 'I am thoroughly impressed that at your age you can perform so well and so often. I have been with guys less than a third of your age who were only good once. You are truly a great lover, Robert.'
Robert, somewhat embarrassed, turns to Jenny and says:
'You mean I was here already?'

The moral of the story:
Don't be afraid of getting old, Alzheimer's has its advantages.

As they walked through the forest to the hermitage, the good citizen said to the drunk, ""The hermit is a holy man above all others living. Please do not do anything that would offend him or he will send us away. I'm doing this for you to learn humility because I am not convinced you have any.""

The good citizen falls to his knees while the drunk stands. The good citizen says, ""O, wise hermit, I'm the best citizen in the town. I have worked tirelessly for my fellow man. I have come to you to save only one more soul and to teach him what humility is.""

He noticed the Drunk didn't say anything so he slapped him on the leg. The drunk says, ""O, wise hermit, I have only one thing to tell you."" At this point the drunk told a joke that was so bawdy and raunchy and feral that it has been lost to history.

You had the honour and hit your ball a modest two hundred fifty yards to the middle of the fairway, leaving a simple 7 iron to the pin. 

Your opponent then hits his ball, lofting it deep into the woods to the right of the fairway. 

Being the golfing gentleman that you are, you help your opponent look for his ball. Just before the permitted five minute search period ends, your opponent says: ""Go ahead and hit your second shot and if I don't find it in time, I'll concede the match."" 

You hit your ball, landing it on the green, stopping about ten feet from the pin. About the time your ball comes to rest, you hear your opponent exclaim from deep in the woods: ""I found it!"" 

The second sound you hear is a click, the sound of a club striking a ball and the ball comes sailing out of the woods and lands on the green, stopping no more than six inches from the hole. 

Now here is the ethical dilemma: Do you pull the cheating bastard’s ball out of your pocket and confront him with it or do you keep your mouth shut?",An Ethical Dilemma,66

at the store he buys the bottle of toothpaste, a bar of soap, a pint of milk and a dozen eggs. 

he returns to the gym, and just like the previous times, the instructor and the class were no where to be seen.

""No, I want answers, why are you getting me to buy you these items?""

""If you really want to know, go get me the following items, a bottle of toothpaste, a bar of soap, a pint of milk, a dozen eggs and 5 lottery tickets of your choosing and I will explain everything to you."" 

The man then proceeds to go to the store and buys the bottle of toothpaste, a bar of soap, a pint of milk, a dozen eggs and 5 lottery tickets. when he returns to the gym, he found it was empty, no instructor and no students.

The doctor said you're in luck, we just happen to be working on a pigmentation adjustment procedure 
We will darking your skin color 3 shades, then we will remove a quarter of your brain and finally we will add 3inches to your penis.
Scared but willing joe agreed and went ahead with the procedure. While in post op the doc came in and said, ""well joe there was a bit of a hiccup, instead of darkening your skin 3 shades we were only able to get it to about 2, instead of taking away a quarter of your brain we pulled out half and instead of adding 3 inches to your dick we accidentally cut 3 inches off...joe do you understand what has happened?""
To which joe replied.....""si senor""

However, before they enter, Saint Peter warns them that there are miniature ducks all over Heaven, and that they are to never, ever, step on them. With that, he leads them into the magnificent realm of Heaven. 

After some time, the three friends decide to have a picnic. They find a nice spot by a fountain, but, before they can settle down, Jake accidentally steps on one of the miniature ducks, which was waddling out of the fountain. Saint Peter immediately appeared, and said to Jake that, as punishment, he would be married to the most ugly, mean single woman in all of Heaven. Then, both Saint Peter and Jake vanished with a flash. 

John and Jack continued the picnic in silence, both of them feeling extremely scared, and triple-checking the ground for ducks before taking a step. However, despite their caution, John still stepped on a duck, who was sneaking up behind him. Saint Peter appeared again, and took John away to marry the most ugly, mean single woman in all of Heaven (not the same woman as Jake had married to, since that woman was no longer single). 

After a few centuries of duck-avoiding and caution, Jack decided to take a walk by the same fountain which he, Jake, and John had once taken a picnic beside. However, just before he stepped onto the path to begin his walk, Saint Peter appeared. Jack pleaded to Saint Peter, saying that he had never stepped on a duck, and shouldn't be married to the most ugly, mean single woman in all of Heaven. However, Saint Peter said he would do no such thing, but was going to reward Jack for not stepping on a duck by marrying him to the most beautiful, nice single woman in all of Heaven. Saint Peter snapped his fingers, and they were immediately married. 

After a few decades of living happily together, Jack asked his wife how he could ever deserve her, and why Saint Peter had married him to her. His wife answered, ""I don't know either - the last thing I remember before being married to you was stepping on a miniature duck!""","Three good friends, Jake, John, and Jack, are accepted into Heaven",117

post,8wnypa,2qh72,jokes,false,1530913145,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8wnypa/national_kissing_day/,self.jokes,,"Because today is national kissing day, let me tell you the story of Motshan Lee, the gypsy arbor, who came up with the name. 

Motshan, a Romanian born in 1564, was incredibly fond of kissing.  In the mid 1500's, romance (named after the most romantic country of Romania) was thriving, however the act of kissing was typically called ""mouthing"" or ""sharing saliva"". Motshan thought these terms were not very romantic, and wanted to find a more appropriate name.

Motshan spent days trying to come up with a word that would reflect the emotions involved in kissing. He spoke with his wife, Lavina, but came up short. He spoke with his son, Veno, but again had no luck. After speaking to all of his immediate family with no results, in true gypsy faith he paid a visit to the town's local mystic. The mystic told Motshan that he was trying too hard, and when the time comes his spirit will come to him. The mystic gave Motshan a small crystal ball and told him when he least expects it, his spirit will guide him - although he must keep the ball with him at all times.

Full of faith, Motshan went back home and told his wife. He was confident he would find the word he so desperately needed with the help of the crystal ball the mystic had given him. Days passed, and the crystal ball produced nothing. Weeks passed, again nothing. After a month, Motshan began to lose faith. He became angry with the ball and in his frustration decided the next day he works, while limbing the tallest tree of the day, he was going to throw the ball and let it shatter on the ground.

Monday arrived, and Motshan took the ball with him to work. The first thing he did was look for the tallest tree in need of limbing. As he climbed up, he began to feel a strange feeling in his pocket. The higher he climbed, the stronger the feeling. Once he reached the highest point in the tree he could, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crystal ball. In the ball he could start to make out letters, and began to record them.

So there he was, Motshan sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G",National Kissing Day,1

The case manager angel on duty was quite put out with the prospect of staying late so rather than looking through the life history of each of the men he decided to admit them based on how cool their death story was. 

The first man began:  I knew my wife was cheating on me.  So one day I decided to go home in the middle of the day to catch her in the act.  I burst through the door and I could tell she was nervous so I tore up the house looking for the dirt bag.  “Where is he?! Where is he?!” I yelled as I looked under the bed, in the closet, behind the shower curtain and in every nook and cranny of our 4th level apartment in a 5 story building.  I had just given up, and fuming, went to our balcony to cool off.  That’s when I saw the little rat.  Two little hands were holding on to dear life as the man hung from the edge of the balcony. I started stomping on his hands but he was more resilient than I had expected.  His right hand would let go, but just before his left hand gave way it would snap back up to maintain his hold.  This went on for several minutes until I got frustrated and ran into the house, grabbed a hammer from the tool box and wailed on his hands until they both released and I watched him fall.  To my dismay he didn’t die.  He landed in some bushes and I could tell that he was still breathing.  In a bout of rage I ran back into the house, rolled the refrigerator to the balcony and sent it flying down on top of him.  The exertion from the moving a refrigerator, the adrenalin from the hunt, and a life of poor diet decisions caused me to have a heart attack and die.

Then came the second man:  I was at home minding my own business when I heard a commotion coming from the apartment directly below mine.  It sounded like a guy was trashing his own place and yelling at his wife.  I’m a naturally curious person so I went out onto my balcony to listen in.  However, I accidentally slipped and fell over the railing!  I live, or rather lived, in a fifth floor apartment so I was lucky to catch the balcony of my neighbor one flight down rather than plummeting to my death.  Just when I was about to pull myself up the guy comes out and starts stomping on my hands!  One hand would fall off, but I would manage to get it back up by the time the other hand fell off.  After several minutes the guy leaves and it looks like I might just be lucky enough to make it out alive.  But then he returns with a hammer and bashes both my hands until I relent and fall to what I assumed would be certain death.  Again, luck shined on me.  I fell into a bush and survived.  However, just as I was gathering myself to hobble off for help a huge refrigerator comes flying down on top of me and that’s when I showed up here. 

Then came the third man:  Picture this, I’m butt naked inside a refrigerator….

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,898

He turned, hurried back to the other two, recounting his error, asking God for forgiveness en route.

“Ma’am. I would like to purchase three tickets to Pittsburgh. And please give my change back in dimes and nickels. I would also like to comment on your attire. You have brought a shame upon you this day as you’ve allowed two blessed men of the cloth an opportunity to question their vows. Your dress is ill suited for any mannequin to wear, much less a woman.  Your top is too low cut as well, allowing the eyes of a stranger to gaze in places they should not.

The first drunk decides that they can just hop a Greyhound bus and be home in no time. He stumbles to the ticket counter and the most beautiful, busty woman he's seen all day was working. He politely asks ""can I please have two pickets to Titsburgh?"" After realizing his word mixup, he makes his way back to his friend and explains how badly he embarrassed himself.  The second, possibly drunker man, decided he would try his luck. ""Excuse me miss, can I get two pickets to Titsburgh?""  She politely smiled and pointed him back to his seat. The two drunks noticed a priest sitting by himself a few seats over. They made their way over to him and explained their slip and begged him to order the tickets for them.  The priest goes to the counter and politely asks for two tickets to Pittsburgh. The beautiful cashier asked Father ""how would you like your change?"" and all he could say was ""nipples and dimes.""",Two Pickets,4
