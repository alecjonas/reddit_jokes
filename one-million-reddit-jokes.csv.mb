There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

Before he went, he made the mistake of eating a jumbo can of beans. Right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies.
When they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and Coke. She said sure, so he went to the restroom. The line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre.
When the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. So he figures he can wait until he drops her off.
When they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''Oh goodie. My grandparents are here. Come on in and meet them.''
He agrees, although his A-hole is about to cry at this point.
They go in and sit down at the table. Finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. As he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog Duke, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. The girl's father stands up and hollers ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.
''Great!'' he thought. ''They really think it's the dog!'' So, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers.
Once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.
Finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most hair-curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. The girl's father stands up again. ''Duke, get the hell out from under him before he shits on you!!''",A Guy goes on a date to the movies,7

The taxi driver tells him he can take him, but it will cost him $100. Engelbert only has $80, so he tells the taxi driver:

'I'll give you $80 now, but I'll need the same ride next week, and then I'll pay you $200'

The cab driver responds, 'Right, how do I know you're not just scamming me? You can walk back to your stupid village.'

Since there are no other taxis around, Engelbert indeed has to walk all the way back to his village, which takes him 4.5 hours. He is not happy, as you can understand.

The next week Engelbert again goes out in the city and again ends up trying to find a ride home at the same taxi stop. Now he has ensured that he has plenty of money left to get a ride home. This time there are three taxis; one of them if the taxi from last week. First, Engelbert goes up to one of the other two taxi drivers.

Engelbert: 'How much to take me to my village?' 

Taxi driver #1: '$100.' 

Engelbert: 'Ok, tell you what. I'll give you $200, but then we stop half way, and you come give me a nice hand job in the back seat.'

His friend suggested that he visit a Swamiji who lived in a nearby cave. “Simply leave a sample of urine outside his cave, and he will meditate on it, miraculously diagnose your problem, and tell you what you can do about it. But it will cost you one hundred dollars.”

Bill figured he had little to lose, so he filled a jar with urine and left it outside the cave with a hundred-dollar bill. The next day when he came back, there was a note waiting for him that said, “You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.”

Later that evening, Bill started to think that the swami’s “miracle” was a put-up job by his friend, who could have written the note and left it outside the cave himself. So Bill decided to get back at his friend. He mixed together some tap water, a yard sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and son. To top it off, he included another bodily fluid of his own, and left the concoction outside the cave with a hundred dollar bill. He then called his friend and told him that he was having some other health problems and that he had left another sample for the swami.

The next day he returned to the cave and found another note that said,“Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins.Your son is hooked on cocaine. Get him into rehab.Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren’t yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don’t stop playing with yourself, your tennis elbow will never get better.”",The magical cave swamiji!,7

""Like I said, I lived in an apartment. There weren't that many places to hide, but I couldn't find him anywhere! Just when I was about to go confront my wife, I see him. The bastard was hiding outside the window, holding onto the windowsill. I go up to him and started stomping on his hands over and over again, but he wouldn't let go. I finally kicked him in the face and he fell. Unfortunately, he landed on a bush and bounced to safety. In my anger, I grabbed my refrigerator and throw it out after him. However, the cord from the refrigerator wrapped around my leg and pulled me to my death.""

St. Peter nods and says, ""You're story is acceptable. Welcome to heaven."" He goes to the second man a brawny working-man type and says, ""What's your story?""

""I'm a window washer,"" says the man. ""I've been a window washer for over 20 years. Well today, I'm washing the windows of the 35th floor of this apartment building when my scaffolding breaks. I thought I was going to die, but I manage to catch myself on the windowsill of the story below. All of a sudden this maniac comes out and starts mashing my fingers. I try my best to hold on, but he kicks me in the face and I fall. Once again, I thought I was going to die, but I land on this hedge and bounce away no worse for the wear. I look up and BOOM. Dead.

Flying near a small brook, he landed on a small strand of grass, just a few inches from the surface of the brook. Looking down, the fly sees a fine mist. Judging the distance just above water, the fly knew that if he flew just 4 inches closer to the water, he would get the mist on he thorax and wings, feel refreshed and fine for the rest of the long, hot afternoon.

Meanwhile, under the surface of the water hiding amongst the reeds and rocks, was a brown trout. Seeing the fly land on the strand off grass, he knew that if the fly flew just 4 inches closer, he'd never see the trout coming. The trout would have food for the day.

Nearby, a keen eyed black bear spotted the trout and the fly. Noting the way the trout was preparing itself to leap out if the water, the bear knew if the fly flew just 4 inches closer, the trout would be too preoccupied with the fly and would never see the bear coming to eat him.

Downstream, sitting in a tree stand, covered head to toe in camouflage, green paint on his face and bear urine on his boots, was Clem. Clem, looking through his scope, could see the scene clearly, all he needed was for that fly to fly 4 inches down to the water, the trout to expose itself to the bear, and the bear to peek just a hit further out on the edge of the brook, preoccupied with trout. This would give him a perfect, clean shot on the bear, and he would fill his tag for the season. Clem then took a bite of cheese sandwich.

Below Clem, a sharp eyed mouse, sat contemplating the scene that lay before him. It would only take the fly going down 4 inches, the trout would jump and eat him, the bear exposing himself to the hunter's rifle, and the hunter dropping his cheese sandwich for him to eat for the rest of the month.

In the brush behind the mouse, was a feral cat. The cat had not eaten in many days, and was desperate to catch the mouse. However seeing the events of the next few seconds play in his head, he knew that if the fly went down 4 inches, the trout would jump to the the fly, the bear would expose himself and get shot by the hunter, who would drop his cheese sandwich, and the mouse, too busy trying to drag away the sandwich, would be the cats meal he'd been missing these so scarcly fed few days.

The fly jumped and hovered for a few minutes, letting himself drop further and further toward his doom. As he neared the water, the trout sprang out of the water, eating the fly in one gulp.

The bear shuffled forward, snatching the trout out of the air.

The hunter aimed and fired, dropping his sandwich to the ground.

As the sandwich fell, the cat, too hungry to wait any longer, pounced out at the mouse.

The mouses keen senses kicked in, narrowly diving the the left of the cat.

The cat landed in the brook, drowning before getting too far.

And the moral of story:

Whenever a fly goes down just four inches, you know that a pussy is in danger of getting wet.","Once, there was a fly.",1

Man: Yes.

Woman: How many beers a day?

Man: Usually about three.

Woman: How much do you pay per beer?

Man: $5.00 which includes a tip.

Woman: And how long have you been drinking?

Man: About 20 years, I suppose.

Woman: So a beer costs $5 and you have three beers a day which puts your spending each month at $450. In one year, it would be approximately $5400 - correct?

Man: Correct.

Woman: If in one year you spend $5400, not accounting for inflation, the past 20 years puts your spending at $108,000 correct?

Man: Correct.

Woman: Do you know that if you didn’t drink so much beer, that money could have been put in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the past 20 years, you could have now bought an airplane?

Man: Do you drink beer?

Woman: No.

As the object came into view it was clearly a chicken. While the man watched in amazement the bird whizzed by him. He checked his speed as this happened: could it really pass him when he was doing 35? There was no way a chicken was going to make a joke of his $18,000 machine. He slammed down the gas pedal and went screaming toward the offending fowl. He grinned with satisfaction as he passed it but a few seconds later he spotted it running even with him staying in view. He studied the bird and noticed that it had three legs! This was really strange. Suddenly the chicken zipped ahead of his car took a sharp left turn and disappeared behind a haystack. The man had to check this out. He spun his wheel and barely made the turn. As he came around the other side of the haystack, he had to stand on his brakes to avoid the farmer who stood complacently chewing a toothpick and looking blankly at the car that nearly flattened him. The chicken stood nearby not even breathing heavily. The man got out of his car. ""This your chicken?"" he asked. ""Yup."" ""How is it possible that it has three legs?"" ""Me and my wife we raise 'em that way"" the farmer droned. The man looked puzzled. ""Why?"" ""Well"" came the reply ""you sit down to dinner with your wife and a guest. You like a drumstick?"" ""Sure, but..."" ""And your wife, she likes a drumstick?"" ""Yeah so?"" ""Your guest might like one too you reckon?"" Now it was clear. ""Oh I see!"" He smiled.

Before he left, he told her that he did not have any cash with him, but that he would have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling the payment ""RENT FOR APARTMENT.""
On the way to his office he regretted and decided it wasn't worth the price. So, he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclosed the following note:

""Dear Madam, 
Enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. 
I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that: 

1) it had never been occupied 

2) that there was plenty of heat 

3) that it was small enough to make me cozy and feel at home. 

Last night, however, I found it had been previously occupied, that there was no heat, and it was entirely too large.""

Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note: 

Dear Sir, First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely.

As for the heat, there is heat if you know how to turn it on. 
Regarding the space, the apartment is, indeed, of regular size, but if you don’t have enough furniture to fill it, please don’t blame the landlady!",A young man met a beautiful girl and agreed to spend the night with her for $500.,4354

The midget answers in an Irish accent, “It’s because I’m a leprechaun. I wished it upon meself.”

“Well, would you be able to give me one, too?” asks the guy.

“Sure!” says the leprechaun. “But, it will cost you.”

“How much?” asks the guy.

“I’m a leprechaun with a pot of gold… What would I need your money for? No, you have to let me shag you up the ass!”

The guy thinks about it for a few moments. “Well, for a dick that big, I could take it once, I guess.”

The leprechaun has the guy drop his pants and get down on all fours. He comes up behind him, slowly pushes it in, and starts to pump.

 “So, what’s your name?” he asks the guy.

“B-B-B-Bob!” he stammers.

“And… How old are ya, Bobby?”

the priest, ""There are no midget nuns in the church."" A little time passed

""No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the city or in the church."" says
the priest. Again the dwarfs resume their annoying giggling to the dismay

""No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the state, in the city, and no
midget nuns in the church."" exclaimed the priest, obviously upset.

The dwarfs continue their interference.

Dopey stands up and asks, ""Father, are there any midget nuns in the country?""

The priest, totally angered, exclaims ""No, my son, there are no midget nuns
in the church, in the city, in the state, no midget nuns in the country,
there are no midget nuns in the whole world!!! Now sit down!!!!!""

Soon afterwards, a chant can be heard from the rear of the church, ""Dopey

Later when it was time for gym, Timmy was delighted to find that he was a basketball superstar. He was sinking every three he shot, dunking on his classmates like a mini Michael Jordan. He was disappointed when gym ended, but when they got back to class, it was circle time. 
“Let’s all hear about your favorite kinds of flowers,” the teacher said. 
“Mine is the rose!” said Mary. 
“Mine is the daisy!” said Johnny. 
When it was Timmy’s turn, he said, “My favorite flower is the purple violet!”
Suddenly, all if his classmates started screaming, and the teacher send Timmy straight to the office. 
When Timmy’s mother picked him up, she was seething. She said, “Timmy, it’s your first ever day of school. What did you do to get expelled on your first day?”
“Well,” Timmy said, who was now even more confused, “I was pretty nervous for my first day of school. First we all said our names and something about ourselves. Mary said she likes dolls, Johnny said he likes action figures, and I said I like basketball.” 
“Then what happened?” asked his mother. 
“Then we went to the gym, and I found out I was really good at basketball. I was sinking every three I shot and dunking on the other kids like a mini Michael Jordan.” 
“Then what happened?” asked his mother, who by then was confused as well. 
“Then we had circle time and we had to say our favorite flower. Mary said her’s was the rose. Johnny said his was the daisy. I said my favorite flower is the purple violet.” 
As soon as the words left Timmy’s mouth, his mother pulled the car over, threw her son out, and sped away. 
Eventually a cop saw Timmy on the side of the toad and pulled over. He asked, “Kid, what are you doing waking on the side of the road?”
“Well,” Timmy said, who was now crying, “I was pretty nervous for my first day of school. First we all said our names and something about ourselves. Mary said she likes dolls, Johnny said he likes action figures, and I said I like basketball.” 
“Then what happened?” asked the cop.
“Then we went to the gym, and I found out I was really good at basketball. I was sinking every three I shot and dunking on the other kids like a mini Michael Jordan.” 
“Then what happened?” asked the cop, who by then was very confused. 
“Then we had circle time and we had to say our favorite flower. Mary said her’s was the rose. Johnny said his was the daisy. I said my favorite flower is the purple violet.” 
As soon as the words left Timmy’s mouth, the cop tasered him, brought him out to the jail, and threw him in a cell. 
When his day in court came, the judge looked down at Timmy and said, “You’re a five year old. What could you have done to end up here?”
“Well,” Timmy said, who was now sobbing uncontrollably, “I was pretty nervous for my first day of school. First we all said our names and something about ourselves. Mary said she likes dolls, Johnny said he likes action figures, and I said I like basketball.” 
“Then what happened?” asked the judge. 
“Then we went to the gym, and I found out I was really good at basketball. I was sinking every three I shot and dunking on the other kids like a mini Michael Jordan.” 
“Then what happened?” asked the judge, who by then was very confused. 
“Then we had circle time and we had to say our favorite flower. Mary said her’s was the rose. Johnny said his was the daisy. I said my favorite flower is the purple violet.” 
As soon as the words left Timmy’s mouth, the judge banged his gavel, and the jury sentenced Timmy to one hundred years in prison without possibility of parole. 
Because he went vegan in the clink, Timmy lived to one hundred and five was able to get out right on schedule. At that point he was so happy to be free, he was skipping through the jail whooping and hollering, right into the street where he was struck and killed by a car. 
So, the morale of the story is to look both ways before crossing the street. ",The Purple Violet,13

post,7715l5,2qh72,jokes,false,1508270119,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7715l5/purina_dog_food_diet/,self.jokes,,"Yesterday I was buying a large bag of Purina dog chow at Wal-Mart and was about to check out. A woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had, an elephant? On impulse, I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, and that I was starting the Purina Diet again.
Although I probably shouldn't, because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.
I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story.)
Horrified , she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no; I stepped off a curb to sniff a poodle´s butt and a car hit me.
I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack, he was laughing so hard!
WAL-MART won't let me shop there anymore.

The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The luxury car, its gleaming shell attracting wishful looks from passer-bys, is parked on the street in front of the bank. The bank officer proceeds with the verifications and everything checks out. The bank thus agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. The car is driven into the bank's underground garage and parked there.

A week later, the blonde returns from her business trip. She returns the loan along with the interest- a total bill of $5000 + $20.

The bank officer says, ""Excuse me madam, pardon our curiosity and all but we checked your credentials to realise that you're actually a millionaire. Why would you need to borrow $5000?""

The blond replies with a smile, ""Where else in a city can I park my luxury car for a week perfectly safely for only $20 and expect it to be there undamaged when I return?""

The man goes to the airport, buys a ticket for the nearest flight to Vegas and a few hours later he finds himself on The Strip. The whispered voice: *enter the first casino! enter the first casino!*.
He complies and enters in the first casino and the whispered voice hits again: *go to the roulette! Go to the roulette!*.

He walks to the roulette and hears the voice again: *put all the money on 14 red! 14 red!*.

The man complies, and puts all of his money on 14 red, then the croupier spins the wheel and the ball. And the ball is spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, slower, slower, it hits the wheel and 
starts bouncing around until it falls into the 26th black pocket.

*oh, shit!*

There were these ducks who lived on this peaceful pond. They got 
into trouble and were sent to the duck who was in charge of the pond, whose
name was Bill. The first one stepped up in front of Bill and looked at the 
ground. 


Bill asked, ""What's your name?""
The little duck replied, ""Duck.""
""Why did you get sent to me?"" queried Bill.
""I was blowing bubbles in the pond,"" answered Duck.
""You know you're not supposed to do that. It's against the rules. You're
suspended from the pond for one week."" 


Duck waddled away. 


The second duck approached Bill.
Bill asked this duck, ""What's your name?""
The little duck replied, ""Duck Duck.""
""Why did you get sent to me?"" queried Bill again.
""I was blowing bubbles in the pond,"" answered Duck Duck.
""You know you're not supposed to do that. It's against the rules. You're
suspended from the pond for one week."" 


Duck Duck waddled away. 


Now Bill, was getting annoyed and thought he had discovered a pattern. When 
the third little duck waddled up to him Bill said, ""Let me guess. You're 
Duck Duck Duck?"" 


""Nope"" replied the little duck. ""I'm bubbles.""
