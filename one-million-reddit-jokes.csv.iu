One day, the hunter who didn't care was out hunting and bagged several animals that he intended to sell for furs.  And when I say many animals, I mean *many* animals, well beyond his legal limit.  But, alas, he didn't care.  He just kept waiting for animals and shooting on sight.  

He had bagged every animal that was in season, but he did not stop there.  He killed animals that weren't in season, because, alas, he didn't care.  

He trashed the woods in which he hunted.  He never picked up his trash or his shell casings, because, you guessed it, he didn't care.

Until the game warden showed up.  The game warden saw the hunter who didn't care and immediately approached him, scorning him for being so careless in his hunting habits.  Of course, the hunter didn't care.  Realizing that nothing he said would morally suade this hunter, he decided to give him an ultimatum.  ""I want some of your furs.  If you don't give me a bear fur, a deer fur, a raccoon fur, and a fox fur, I will haul you off to jail.""

Giving away a few furs?  No big deal.  The hunter didn't care.

He skinned a bear and gave the warden the fur.

He skinned a deer and gave the warden the fur.

He skinned a raccoon and gave the warden the fur.

But at the end of the day, he ended up in jail, because the hunter who didn't care had no fox to give.",The hunter who didn't care,14

Teacher: ""Can anyone think of an animal that starts with the letter *A*?""

Jim eagerly raised his hand but she couldn't possibly call on him, he would certainly say ""Ass"". She called on another student who gave a correct and pleasant answer. 

Teacher: ""Can anyone think of an animal that starts with the letter *B*?""

Jim stretched his arm as high as he could and waived it around feverishly but she could not call on him for he would surely say ""Bitch"". She instead called on the little girl in the front row. 

This pattern would repeat itself until the teacher reached the letter *R*. The teacher, knowing Jim couldn't possibly come up with a vulgar *R animal*, called on him and relief swept over Jim's face - finally it was his turn. 

Jim stood from his desk and declared proudly, ""*R* is for *RAT*."", he paused, ""A Giant Fucking *Rat* with a Huge Dick.""

She of course replies with a yes and proceeds to read the paint can for instructions.

He rushes over to her and realizes she has a couple of thick coats on. Confused because it’s the middle of summer so hurriedly, he takes them off and cools her down as quickly as possible and soon she comes too.

He asks: “Honey, why on earth were you wearing two coats? It’s the middle of summer!”

So, the husband comes in and the doctor explains what happened and says to him, “this might sound crazy, but we think that oral sex just might snap her out of her coma.”

Her husband says, “really? Well, if you think so.”

So, they close the curtain and let the husband do his thing. After about two minutes the monitor flatlines. The staff come rushing in, tries to resuscitate her, but it’s too late.

The doctor turns turns to the husband and says, “I wonder what happened. Did you notice anything?”

The media frenzy surrounding the launch was maddening. Everywhere John went, the media followed him.

He would part the curtains at his home in the morning, and the media was out there peering in, trying to get a shot of him going about his day. 

It wasn't just the media - even his friends and relatives began pouring in. His house was literally filled to the brim with people every single minute.

There was barely any room to walk around the house, and leaving the house meant a swarm of reporters would follow him everywhere. It was becoming too much for John and NASA called in their medical team to look at his condition, only to reveal that John was becoming claustrophobic due to the constant pressure of people around him, not giving him a moment of peace and quiet.

The launch now in jeopardy, NASA were looking for a replacement but John decided to overcome his phobia and insisted that he would make the trip. Eventually, NASA decided to go ahead with John but were constantly monitoring his heart rate.

John's heart was beating dangerously fast as he walked towards the craft, got strapped in and went up. However, as soon as they were out of the Earth's atmosphere, he calmed down and became completely normal.

Turns out, all he needed was a little space.",John was an Astronaut...,37

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.

But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.

Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.

Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.

But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.

Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""

Curious, Attila did as he asked.

Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.

""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.

Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.

To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

“I rubbed it and a genie appeared and granted me one wish and then he said I must pass the lamp on to the next person that did me a kindness”

“Wow” says the barman.

The man then says “as you gave me a drink I’m going to let you have the lamp”

“Be careful what you wish for tho”

He is curious but doesn't think anymore of it until he sees another sign 10 miles up the road declaring the fantastic pig only 20 miles away. This continues up until 5 miles away from the supposed fantastic pig, so curiosity burning, the man turns down a driveway declaring itself to be the home of the fantastic pig.

John drives down a long thin dirt road with trees on either side for quite a while before it opens up with a house in a wide yard. The man has to get out to open the gate and when he does several dogs come running up to the gate with a pig in tow. The pig has two peg legs. John is even more curious now and quickly closes the gate so the animals don't get out.

As he walks up to the house in the heat a man emerges from the house and welcomes him. 

'You here about the fantastic pig?' The farmer asks. John nods.

'Was that it? The one with the two peg legs?' He asks. The fantastic pig owner nods. 'Well, what makes it so fantastic?' 

'Let me tell you. Couple years ago the kids were swimming near the dam and the youngest fell in. The other didn't notice but the pig did. Pig dived in and swam to my drowning child and pulled him out. Just like that.' 

John is impressed.

'That is fantastic!' 

'Another time the kitchen caught on fire when my wife was home. She was outside putting clothes on the line and didn't realise. The pig did and unwound the hose, turned the tap on with its nose and ran into and put the fire out.'

John is practically jumping with excitement.

'Wow!' He exclaims. 'That's even more fantastic!' 

The farmer goes on.

'Another time a wolf came up close to the house and was about to attack one of the children and the pig stopped it. Scared it off.' 

John is just in awe and turns around searching for the pig. There it is, lazing in the sun with its peg legs. Turning back around he says, 'The peg legs, are they from fighting with the wolf?'

The farmer shakes his head. John is curious now.

'Well what happened to him?'

The farmer crossed his arms and stared at John.

A guy is driving around and sees a sign in front of a house: “Talking Dog for Sale.”
He rings the bell, and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a Labrador retriever.

“You talk?” he asks.

“Yep,” the Lab replies.

“So, what’s your story?”

“Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young,” the Lab says. “I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders. I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running.
“But jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger, so I wanted to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some shady deals, and the mayor and the governor gave me a batch of medals. Then I got married, I had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.”

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

“Ten dollars.”

“This dog is amazing,” the guy says. “Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”

“Because he’s a liar. He didn't do any of that stuff!”",A Dog's Story,51

Prince and a princess had a feast and then went to their chambers to consume their marriage, but there was a problem - the princess wouldn't let prince make love to her.

The prince waited and tried every day for next couple of months but he could not make love to her.

He got worried. After all, he is a prince and he has to continue his bloodline.

He remembered that he heard a rumor about a witch that lives deep in the forest - and does all sorts of magical drinks- including love potions that may help him with his problems.

He went to the woods and found the witch's cabin. When he explained his situation to the witch, she told him that there is a potion just right for his situation - but she missed the main ingredient - the dragon's testicle. 

Prince was really desperate and decided to go for it. For 7 years he traveled - through woods, deserts, hills and mountains.

He finally found the dragon's lair and fought him for a week. He barely succeeded to kill the dragon - even losing his hand in process. And after another 9 years of traveling (he was hurt and had to carry dragon's huge nut on his back) prince returned back to his kingdom.

He went to the witch with the testicle, hoping that he will get a potion - but the witch said that it will take a year to prepare the ingredients. So he waited for another year. When he came back to her for the potion she said it needs to rest for another year. Prince slowly started to lose his nerve but still he waited. After another year the potion was finally done. 

Prince then asked the witch: ""So, do I just give it to my princess to drink?""

She said ""No. You have to cook a dinner for your princess and all the food has to be very salty. Then you prepare a table for her. It's very important to put a chalice with the potion in the middle of the table. As she eats, the salty food will make her thirsty. She will reach for the chalice in the middle of the table - and as she bends over  you quickly go behind her and fuck her!""",The princess wouldn't let prince make love to her,12

Everyone is sitting around the kitchen table - the elderly father and mother and their two adult sons. Their only farm animal, a cow named Bessy, has been milked and tended to, the house is clean and a hot meal has been prepared by the mother. The whole family eats away and tiredly exchanges a few words about their day.

After the food is gone, the mother starts knitting, the father starts reading a newspaper and smoking a pipe, the elder son opens up a can of beer and the younger son starts cleaning his dads shotgun, thinking about going hunting tomorrow or maybe the day after that.

A few hour pass, the evening is coming to a close and it's time to go to sleep. Everyone gets in their beds, the parents go to their room and both sons go to theirs. 

Around midnight the mother feels that something is not quite right in her stomach. She hears her insides rumbling so she clenches down there as hard as she possibly cana and s runs outside, heading straight to the outhouse behind the barn. Just as she is about to reach her destination her bowels can't hold any longer and her body releases the brown liquids before she even had time to lift up her white night gown.

The feeling of release is so satisfying the mother doesn't even care about her ruined clothes, maybe she's even smiling to herself in relief. She heads over to the well, throws her spoiled outfit into a wooden basin and spills some water in the basin so the clothes can soak over night. 'As I am already at the well, I might as well get some water for Bessy. Maybe she got thirsty' she thinks to herself, gets another bucket of water and heads to the barn.

As the mother opens the door to the barn she lets out a horrifying scream. Their only farm animal, Bessy, is dead! 

'She is everything we had! No more milk, no more cheese, no more butter, no more money! We have a mortgage on the farm! My husband doesn't love me and my sons are idiots, Bessy was the only thing dear to me!' In this terrible moment the mother grabs a rope out of the barn and heads straight to the nearest tree.

At the same time the husband wakes up hearing the commotion outside, he sees that his wife is not in bed and must be the one who woke him up. He gets out of bed goes looking for the old lady so he could give her a piece of his mind and maybe a piece of his boot.

Just as he gets outside he notices his wife hanging on a tree branch, bare and blue. 'It's about time the old hag got out of my life' he thinks to himself but then he notices the open barn door and the dead cow. 

'THE COW IS DEAD?!' he screams, 'No more milk, no more cheese, no more butter, no more money! I have a mortgage on the farm! My sons are idiots and my wife was a hag but at least she knew how to cook!'. In this terrible moment he goes to the kitchen and grabs his shotgun.

The elder son is woken up by large bang. He gets out of his room and heads to the kitchen, where he sees his dad hunched over in his chair with his head blown off. 'Finnaly,' he thinks to himself, 'now all I have to do is get rid of the old hag and I have the farm to myself!' He heads out to the outhouse, unable to contain his happiness inside him. On his way he notices his dead mother hanging on a tree branch.

The elder son cannot believe his luck, with his folks gone he is officially the farm owner. But then he notices the open barn door and the dead cow. 

'The cow was our only source of income!' he shouts, as he realises what had happened to him, 'No more milk, no more cheese, no more butter, no more money! I didn't inherit a farm, I inherited a huge debt! My brother is an idiot, he can't help me handle this!' In this terrible moment he heads to the river to drown himself.

As he aproaches he hears a faint voice from the stream 'Do not drown yourself. I can bring back your cow, bring back your mother, bring back your father.'

A mermaid sticks out of the water, perfect body, breasts splashing around. 'I can make all your problems go away,' she says 'all you have to do is make love to me ten times.' 

'Ten times? Well that is a lot but what do I have to lose?' the man says, 'Let's try'.

The mermaid comes out of the water, pulls down her fish skirt and they get at it. One time... Two times... Five.. Seven...

'I can't do this anymore.' The man cries out.

'Then I cannot help you' The mermaid answers and dives back into the river.

Having lost all hope, the elder son follows her and drowns himself.

At this time the sun is starting to rise, the youngest son gets out of bed and heads to the kitchen, hoping his mother has prepared a big breakfast meal for him. However, all he finds on the table is the bits and pieces of his fathers head. He looks at his dad for a moment, rubs his eyes that are still half closed and speaks to his dad's corpse

'You couldn't even be bothered to blow your head outside, you inconsiderate lazy bastard? Now someone is going to have to clean out this mess you now?

Still being hungry, he then heads out to look for his mother, whom he finds hanging outside.

'Someone is going to have to get you down, you old hag!' he shouts at her body.

The young man decides he can't deal with this situation his parents had put him in right now so he grabs a fishing rod and heads towards the river, he'll think of something when he comes back. Nearing the river he notices his dead brother floating on the other side of the stream.

'Great! I can't even go fishing! You scared away all the fish you idiot!' he shouts at his brother.

But he then hears a voice from the stream 'Come closer. I can bring back your cow, bring back your mother, bring back your father, bring back your brother,' the same mermaid sticks out of the water, perfect body, breasts splashing around, 'I can make all your problems go away,' she says, 'all you have to do is make love to me ten times.'

'Wait wait? Ten times?' the younger brother asks.

'Well... Yes... If that's too much then...'

'Too much? Don't make me laugh, I was going to ask if you're so eager for ten maybe we can go for twenty?'

'I guess?' the mermaid blushes, taken a back by the peculiar young man.

'Wait wait, if you're so into this, why not make it thirty?' the man asks again.

'I... I guess we can do thirty' whispers the river girl, trying to hide her face that is now completely red.

'Promise?'

'Promise...'

The mermaid comes out of the water, pulls down her fish skirt and they get at it. One time... Two times... Five.. Seven...

'This is great!' the son shouts, 'but you better not die on me like the fucking cow did!'

“Can we help?”, asked Watson.

“I hope so”, said the man. “There have been the most peculiar goings on at my house recently. My family are rather distressed and I fear you may be the only ones left to put an end to the affair.”

“Go on”, interjected Sherlock

“Well, it all started a few weeks ago. I had retired to the library to read, when the children rushed in, screaming about an apparition in the garden. They had been playing hide and seek, as youngsters care to do – Roland was hiding behind the potting shed. As Lucinda worked her way around the grounds looking for him she became aware of a glowing round object that had appeared by the vegetable patch. Slowly it began to follow her and, obviously distressed, she called out – her brother had seen the same thing from his hiding place and together they ran, afraid. They said it chased them all the way into the house.

“Of course, I was understandably sceptical of the whole story, young minds do love to create stories. However, I cannot disbelieve my own eyes – some days later, a warm night, I was out on the terrace enjoying the fine weather we have been having recently. Suddenly, I saw it. A glowing, pulsating orb had appeared at the end of the garden, moving seemingly purposefully from side to side. I went down the steps to get a closer look and suddenly it stopped, grew brighter and began to drift towards me. I confess I had the same reaction as my children and fled into the house.

“My, this is a curious case”, remarked Sherlock, “Perhaps we should come and experience this for ourselves. I’m sure there is an explanation.

“Have you seen it since?”, enquired Watson.

“A brief glimmer last Thursday, though I cannot be sure”, replied Percival, “but last night it was in the garden again, brighter than ever, a shimmering globe. It seemed to be searching for something, so I stayed in and resolved to contact you. Please, can you help?”

“Certainly”, replied Sherlock, “but we must see it for ourselves.”

For the next few days Sherlock and Watson explored the garden, though there were no unusual sightings.

After a few days, they were beginning to themselves disbelieve the man’s story, so they decided to stake out the vegetable patch and see whether the apparition would visit them. Suddenly, while crouched by the runner beans, Watson heard a noise.

He turned, to see a shining sphere moving towards them.

“By Jove”, he whispered, “I think Foot’s ball’s coming, Holmes!”","Sherlock and Watson were sitting in the apartment one day when a man entered, with something obviously on his mind.",0

He had passed by it, many times and never gone in. Something however had made him come in this time, there was a small line ahead of him to the counter. He was far enough away the very small print of the menu items were unreadable. So to pass the time waiting for the line to move he began to look around the store. 

It was a small shop, not very large, a small swinging door disappeared into a back room. There was only one server and She seemed busy with the front most customer. An older lady who barely reached the top of the counter. Maybe she had shrunk with age? Maybe she was born that size? Maybe if she had been born that size and had not yet shrunk, she would begin to shrink soon? Maybe this time next year she wouldnt be able to see over the counter? A loud ""Pssssshhhhh"" startled him, he realized the server was pulling knobs on a large machine and steam was spouting from it making the noise. He decided it was just a normal hot beverage sort of thing and continued to look around. 

A homeless looking fellow, stood behind the tiny shrinking or soon to be, shrinking lady. The man had an old military jacket and the hair of someone who had slept in the wind. A faint whiff of stale hotdogs eminated from him and the only respite seemed to be the over sprayed body spray of the young man between them. A typical crowd but not one he was content to wait behind for much longer. 

He heard the door behind him open and turned to take in the new occupant of the store. A beautiful redheaded woman, looking in her early twenties had stepped in behind him. 
Making eye contact he greeted her with a friendly Hello. 
She smiled back but turned her attention to her phone in her hand. 

He returned his gaze to the menu board. Still unable to see the items due to the small print he sighed and waited his turn. 
The older woman wandered off finally with a small mug in her hands. Off to the far left through a doorway. As he moved forward into the third spot in line, he could see sunlight streaming in. ""Must be some sort of side room, you can dine in?"" He thought.
The homeless looking man took his time as well, looking to have only ordered a hot glass of water for some reason? The homeless man continued to chat with the server girl, much to her apparent discomfort. 

The young man between them seemed to take offence to this. He swayed in discomfort, almost as if ready to pounce for the counter, as soon as the homeless man moved. Finally the homeless man took his hot cup of water and headed fpr the sunny room to the left. The young man really did pounce for the counter then. 

""Karen! I Love You!"" He nearly croaked with voice crack. He knelt in front of the counter eyes now level with it. Looking up doe eyed at the server girl. 
Karen, it would appear, was not pleased with this display of romance toward her. Rolling her eyes and putting on a disgruntled face of disappointment. 
""You shouldnt be here Reggie.."" She drawled. 

The Man dispite the show, was getting impatient. How long had he been in here? It felt like hours? Why was it taking so long to get a hot beverage? 
The young man in front of him, Reggie apparently. Fumbled in his pocket and produced a small box. 

""You have got to be kidding me?"" The man gasped. 

Reggie and Karen turned to look at him in disgust, as he was interrupting a moment. 
After sufficiently communicating their shared hatred of him. They continued their conversation. Thus time at least quietly enough the man could not over hear. 
Reggie made grand gestures and karen waved her hands about. Reggie made more grand gestures and Karen smiled. Reggie made a few more gestures and Karen finally sighed loudly and laid her hand within reach of the still kneeling Reggie. 
The young redhead behind the man coo'd with delight. 
""Thats so romantic! Isnt that romantic?"" She said. .
The man turned and merely smiled at her. 

After another few minutes of Karen and Reggie kissing and hugging and Reggie kissing her now ring bearing hand, he shouting their love at no one in particular. 
This commotion brought those sitting in the sunny room to the left to peer out. The old lady who could be shrunk or shrinking came to congratulate them, then made her way back into the sunny room. The homeless man stood in the entry way between the rooms and stared hatred at Reggie then turned and went back into the sunny room. 

Finally Reggie said something about having to leave to go to work. And with a few final kisses exchanged moved out of the way and went out the door. 

The man finally at the front of the line stood staring at the menu. 
After all of this waiting and waiting, the words were still to small to read. Not wanting to waste another moment in this horrible time warp of a place he simply asked the server.. Karen.. 

""Listen young lady ive waited a long goddamned time. Just give me the first thing on the menu, so i can get out of this damn lineup!"" 

Karen smiled, her customer service smile.
""Oh that would be Priori-tea""

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know.""

""If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,"" I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth"".

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound"".

He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door"".

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.

He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.

 

The next day the paper read:

One day he met a man at a bar, they got talking and the man told him about these new shoes his company was developing; no matter how out of it you were the shoes could always take you home - even if you couldn’t move you would always end up outside your front door the next morning.

So my friend, taking a liking to what he heard, agreed to test out these new shoes. He put them on the first night he got them and, as always, he went out and got completely blitzed. 

But, just as the man had said, he woke up the next morning lying in the bushes outside his home - for the first time in over a year after he had been out partying. He was so impressed that he took the next week off work and went partying every day, each morning awaking outside his home safe and sound.

This continued for months until, unfortunately for my friend, the shoes began to get bored. They wanted to see the world, not just the damp dance floors of run down clubs.

So, one day, the shoes decided to go and live their dream. Once my friend had passed out, they did not take him home but instead decided to go out and do their own thing. 

Long story short my friend ended up in Burma.

This continued and every night he went out my friend never seemed to wake up outside his house. Eventually he had had enough, and he threw the shoes out wanting nothing to do with them.

But, being intelligent, the shoes began to feel lonely and kept trying to get my friend to use them again. Every night they would bang on his front door, willing him to take them back - but this only made him angrier.

Finally my friend had had enough; he locked the shoes in the only place he could think of - his car. But, as he always left a spare car key under the rug ( conveniently) the shoes managed to start the car and began to drive off.

But, as they were only shoes, they were unable to steer so drove right into a canal that was opposite the house.

My friend was devastated, believing he had killed the shoes. He was so torn he even went to a priest about it. The priest managed to comfort him by assuring him that the shoes had gone to heaven.

Because as it turns out, shoes have soles.",Did I ever tell you about my friend who bought experimental AI shoes?,112

They were going to be interviewed by the CEO to see who was best for the job.

One of the men was a Harvard grad who had a degree in economics and a history of white collar jobs. The other was a blue-collar man who’d worked the factory floor and knew what it was like to do all of the labor he would be managing.

The CEO had a very difficult choice. In order to decide he told the two men to each write a poem. The two conditions were that they had to write it in thirty seconds, and they had to use the word “Timbuktu”.

Thinking that he could beat any stupid cowboy, the Harvard grad went first. After thinking for about a minute, he came up with the following:

“Slowly across the desert sand
Trekked the dusty caravan.
Men on camels, two by two
Destination -- Timbuktu.”
The CEO was fairly pleased, and doubted the cowboy could top that, but he gave him a shot regardless. As his time passed, the cowboy sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:

“Tim and me, a-huntin' went.
Met three whores in a pop-up tent.
They was three, we was two,
So I bucked one and Timbuktu”",My favorite joke my dad’s told me to date,1732

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,17

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'


So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'


When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.


A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'


'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied. 'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. 


You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'


Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'


'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'


'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.


'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.


'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'


'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'


'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'


The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'


She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'


You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'


So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.


The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'


'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.


'No Kidding,' he said.


'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'

After failing to find my car keys in my handbag and pockets, I started to panic. I headed back to the conference room and still couldn't find the keys.

I suddenly realized that I must have left them in the car. This has been a topic of several debates at home, where my husband always lectures me for leaving the keys in the ignition.

Personally, I think leaving it there is not only convenient but also a great way to avoid misplacing them at home.

But my husband's theory is that this ""strategy"" makes it easier for the car to get stolen.

My worst fears were realized when I rushed to the parking lot and couldn't find my car. It had been stolen and...my husband was right.

So I immediately called the police and gave them my location, a description of the car, where I parked and so on. I also confessed that I left my keys in the ignition and that was probably how the car got stolen.

Then I made the most difficult call of all...the one to my husband.
 
""Honey..."" I stammered; I always call him 'honey' in times like these. ""I left my keys in the car....and it has been stolen.""

There was a long pause on his end. I thought the call had been dropped, but then I heard his voice, ""How could you lose the car? I drove you to the hotel!""

I didn't think my embarrassment could escalate but it did. But I also felt a sense of relief rush through me...thank goodness. I then replied, ""In that case, do you mind picking me up?""

Surprisingly, my husband's reply didn't contain that 'I told you so' tone. Instead, it was filled with only frustration and I realized why soon after.

He replied, ""I will as soon as I can convince the police that I haven't stolen your car!"" ","Signs of aging, from a lady",38
