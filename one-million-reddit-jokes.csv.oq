They tie him up and take him to their local village, where they tie him to a stake and prepare to cook and eat him.

As the firewood is being placed around his feet, the tribe leader approaches and says: ""Wait! Before we kill and eat you, you have one chance for freedom. All you have to do is pass the challenge of the three caves.""

The explorer agrees, is freed and led to the bottom of a mountain. As the mountain path continues towards the skies, there are three caves on the route. The tribe leader explains to the explorer: ""in order to pass, you must pass the trial set in each of the caves.""

""In the first cave, there is a huge pitcher of potent ale. You have to drink it all; it will make you drunk for the other two challenges.""

""In the second cave, there is a tiger with a sore tooth. Remove the tooth in any way you can and survive, and you have one cave left.""

""In the third cave, there is the tribe's most beautiful woman. You must pleasure her in any way you can. If you manage to complete all three trials, you're free to leave.""

The explorer fancies his chances, so he sets off into the first cave. He drinks the ale and comes out, belching and staggeringly drunk. He thens heads into the second cave to attend to the tiger.

At the bottom of the hill, moments after the explorer has entered the cave, the tribe leader and his men hear roaring and screaming, and finally silence. Just as the tribe leader is preparing to send his men to retrieve the body from the cave, the explorer leaves the cave battered and bloody. He shouts down to the tribe leader: ""now where's that woman with the sore tooth?""

The winners of the competition are often lauded within the mining community and there is a grand prize of £100,000.

The semi-final is between ten different miners and, this year, two friends, Jack and Stephen, make it to the semi-finals. They line up with the other eight competitors and the announcer fires the gun.

Suddenly all ten of the miners start hurriedly picking through the mountain in front of them. *Pick pick pick*. The race is fairly even to begin with, but, soon enough, Jack and Stephen's mining prowess sees them begin to pull ahead of the competition. They can't see each other, due to the rock and other competitors between them, but they know the other must also be doing well as they are both similarly talented. As the semi-final drags on, it becomes clear that the final will be between Jack and Stephen, the clear front-runners in the competition. *Pick pick pick*. Their families and friends cheer them on, watching from the screens in the viewing area, which are linked to cameras in the tunnels at designated spots throughout the routes. 

The race ends and Jack and Stephen are to be in the final. The crowd goes wild, then heads home to have dinner and rest before tomorrow's final. Jack heads to see his family also and they go out for dinner at a wonderful Mexican restaurant. Whilst there his wife leans in to tell Jack a secret:

""Jack, do you know about Stephen?"" she asks.

""What about Stephen?"" Jack responds.

""You haven't heard?""

""No. What is it darling?""

""His wife is leaving him,"" she says, ""and she's taking the children"".

Jack continues to eat his dinner, but the thought weighs heavy on his mind. He and Stephen hadve been friends since they were children, working in other peoples' mines for a living. Now they each own their own mining companies and have made great successes of themselves. But Stephen's wife has always been promiscuous and never seemed trustworthy. In earnest, Jack always felt that she was with Stephen for the money. She was just too beautiful for him, and Stephen seemed a little too blind in love to notice. 

As Jack continues to think about the consequences of the looming divorce, it dawns on him that Stephen might have to close his business. Stephen had once confided in him that the company was profitable, but that there was a real concern that he might have to close it if he was unable to keep profits up. 

After dinner, and whilst his family slept, Jack creeps out of his hotel room and knocks on Stephen's door. 

""Hey Jack,"" Stephen says in a dreary, slumbered state, ""what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be resting for the race tomorrow?""

""I heard about your wife, Stephen,"" Jack responds, ""what's going to happen to the company?""

Now fully awake and quite angry, Stephen says ""I might lose it. But that's none of your business Jack. Why are you asking me this now?""

""Look Stephen"", Jack says, trying to console his friend, ""I'm going to throw the competition tomorrow. You need the money more than I do. My company is healthy and I don't have to worry about paying for a divorce. You deserve it.""

Stephen, now quite incensed, responds angrily, ""don't you fucking dare Jack! We've both been working towards this our whole lives, training and honing our skills to be the best in the business. Now we're in the final and you want to throw it for personal reasons? And if I win? How would I feel knowing that it was a hollow victory? You had better try your hardest Jack, I do not need your sympathy.""

""Okay, Stephen,"" says Jack, a little dejected, ""may the best man win I suppose"". 

Both men go back to their rooms and slleep a full night's sleep in anticipation of the final.

---

It is the day of the final and Jack and Stephen are standing at the starting line. The crowd are drinking beer and eating hot dogs, cheering loudly. Jack and Stephen are right next to each other this time and will be able to gauge each other's progress as they mine through the mountain. 

Jack is in deep thought as he prepares for the race. He wants to help his friend, but knows that this is an important race and a competition both have always wanted to win. Bearing in mind the previous night's discussion, he decides to go at it with the best of his ability. 

*BANG*, the announcer fires the gun and the two men start digging into the mountain.

*Pick pick pick*.

The two friends and competitors are completely inseparable for the first half of the race. At some points Stephen is inches ahead, at others, Jack is. The crowd is shouting, jumping and screaming. This is the best race the National Mining Championship has ever seen.

*Pick pick pick*

Suddenly Jack starts to pull marginally ahead. Adrenaline is coursing through his body and he can feel that the win is in his hands. 

*Pick, pick, pick*

With each strike of the pick-axe, Jack can feel himself one step closer to victory and glory.

 *Pick. Pick. Pick.*

Suddenly Jack's mind is overwrought with guilt. He remembers the conversation with Stephen and, although Stephen had urged him to compete, he realises what winning might do to his dear friend. He considers offering Stephen a partnership role in his business, but knows that Stephen is not fond of pity. 

*Pick. Pick. Pick.""*

Jack slows down. He has to let Stephen win, he decides. Just a bit less effort in each swing of the axe.

*Pick... Pick... Pick...*

Suddenly Stephen starts to catch up. Slowly but surely, he manages to overtake Jack and begins to establish a lead. But Stephen knows how good of a miner Jack is. It seems overly suspicious to him and he too remembers the preceding night's conversation. He is outraged that Jack would ignore his desires and belittle him like this.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" Shouts Stephen loud enough that Jack can hear him through the walls.

... Silence.

""HEY JACK!""

...

""Stop trying to *under-mine* me!""

A man thought that he’d take chances and decided to take walnuts. To his dismay, the king not only had walnuts but all possible fruits in his garden. For his punishment two king’s guard proceeded to shove the walnuts up his arse in the full court. He howled in pain through the process and then suddenly started laughing hysterically.

A man absolutely hated his wife's cat and decided to get rid of him one day by driving him 20 blocks from his home and leaving him at the park.

As he was getting home, the cat was walking up the driveway.

The next day he decided to drive the cat 40 blocks away. He put the beast out and headed home.

Driving back up his driveway, there was the cat!

He kept taking the cat further and further and the cat would always beat him home. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right until he reached what he thought was a safe distance from his home and left the cat there.

Hours later the man calls home to his wife: ""Jen, is the cat there?""

""Yes,"" the wife answers, ""why do you ask?""

Frustrated, the man answered, ""Put that son of a ***** on the phone, I'm lost! and need directions!""

The bar was very busy and quite loud. He walks up to the bar and gestures to the barkeep that he was ready to whet his whistle. The barkeep put one finger up as if to say I'll be right with you. As the man waited he casually peered around the bar. There were patrons drinking, talking, laughing, singing, playing pool. For the most part it was your typical atmosphere. However, as the man's eyes gazed towards the corner he noticed a little tiny man, and he was playing the smallest piano the man had ever seen. It was shocking to say the least. 

When the barkeep had finally made his way over to the man, he asked ""What can I get ya?"" The man was still confused, and ignored the question and instead pressed for some answers. ""That piano player, I'm curious... where did you find him?"" The barkeep bent over the bar and leaned toward the man as if to indicate that it was a secret. Ever so inquisitive, the man leaned in and readied himself for the answer. ""I have a genie in the back of the bar..."" he whispered into the man's ear. ""A genie?"" the man said in disbelief. ""Yes! A genie... he will grant anyone who stands before him one wish."" The barkeep replied matter-of-factly.  It was a bit too far-fetched for the man to believe but he humored the barkeep. ""Do you mind if I see him?"" Hesitantly, the barkeep gave the affirmative, ""Sure, go right ahead."" 

So the man walked towards the back of the bar, pushing through the crowd of oblivious patrons. As he approached the door, he took a deep breath before he entered. Sure enough, just as the bartender had stated, there was a genie floating right before his very eyes. As the man moved closer, the genie bellowed out his greeting. ""Greetings mortal, I am Sun-Jin. As you stand before me, I must grant you one wish. Choose wisely."" The man thought about his wish for just a second before he blurted ""I would like a million bucks!"" The genie bowed his head and said ""It shall be done.""

The moment those words had left the genie’s lips a million ducks appeared out of thin air. The poured out of the back of the bar into the crowd of now frightened people. There was so many ducks that they had burst through the door into the streets. Mothers held their children close; grown men wept at the chaos that lay before them. As the confusion set in, the man drudged his way over to the barkeep. “Hey! You!” The man shouted, “I think your genie is hard of hearing.” The bartender frowned, “You’re telling me! Do you really think I wished for a 12 inch pianist?”",A man walks into a bar...,2

post,64twzk,2qh72,jokes,false,1491946658,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/64twzk/kip_the_flatfish_long/,self.jokes,,"There was a flatfish whose name was Kip. He had an unfortunate and rare condition for a flatfish, Tourette’s syndrome... He sporadically blurted out noises like, ""Eee"" and Orr"" and most of the time at the worst moments ""Eeeyyooorree""

He spent most of his days skimming along the bottom of the seabed in his home, Shallow Waters 

Kip was in love with sally salmon. Sally with her shiny pink scales and her fluttering gills. kip knew he didn’t stand a chance, he was an ugly flatfish and he had no confidence, because every time he tried to talk to her, he’d interrupt with a loud, obnoxious ""eyyyooorrree"" and she’d swim off. Sally was the type of gal who liked a big hunky, rich fish, not a little twerpy flatfish with a speech impediment.

Kip decided, ""I've gotta ,Eeyy, do something about this ,Oorr."" So Kip packed up all of his belongings and set out a journey to find someone who could fix his problem. 

After hours of skimming the ocean floor, deep in thought about sally salmon, Kip stumbled across a wrecked pirate ship. The ship looked like a complete ruin, but Kip saw a light on Inside and decided to investigate. Carefully, Kip entered the sea wreck and Inside was an empty bar with dirty old broken stools and a crab stood on the other side. ""Why ello there me ‘arty"" said the crab. ""What is this Eyyy place, and why is it so Orrrr empty?"" Asks Kip. ""Well"" says the crab, ""this eer is the tavern of woe."" ""Buy yourself a drink, tell me your tale of woe and I guarantee I can solve the problem for you.""

""Ok"", says Kip as he takes a sip of his drink, ""it’s like this..."" And in between Eeyyys and Oorrrs and eyyyooorrres kip explains everything from beginning to end, from Sally salmon to being ugly and unconfident.

""You do have a problem don’t ye"" said the crab. 

""Well, you’ve come to the right place me arty."" ""I know exactly what you need to do. You need to go see the unfathomable eight."" And the crab explains, ""it’s said they lie deep beneath the oceans floor, in the cave just west of this eer tavern, and only those with a true heart can find them."" ""Once there, they have the power to make your dreams a reality, but you’ll have to leave who you were behind"".

""NooOOOrrr problem for meeEyyy"" says Kip, already on his way out the door.

""Thanks fOooor the drink..."" and with that Kip swooshes out of the door and along the sea bed once more. With clear direction and determination in his mind, he knew where he had to go now, for Sally.

After a while, Kip saw the cave up ahead. As he got closer he noticed the sign at the entrance... ""Only those of pure heart dare enter the perils ahead.""

Wiping the sweat off his brow, Kip thinks, ""I've got nothing to lose"" and wonders slowly into the dark dank cave. In the cave there was a deep dark pit. The howling noise the pit made grew loader and loader the longer Kip stared at it. He felt a lump in his throat grow into a tennis ball.

Kip built up the courage and jumped into the pit. A vortex like suction took hold of his fins and pulled him faster then a speeding bullet directly down with more force than he’d ever experienced before. ""Oh shhhhhiiiiieeeEyyyyyooorrrrr"" as the vortex pulled Kip faster and faster, with more and more force, towards what seemed to be the middle of the world.

Until finally, just before his eyes were about to leave the rest of his little flatfish body behind, everything ground to a halt as he hit the sea bed with a tremendous thud!

Towering above him in formidable ambivalence was an octopus so big it made billy blue whale look like a sardine. Surrounded by cliff edges taller then the dim light could reach, Kip felt like this might have been a mistake after all.

In a deep resonating voice the octopus said, “you’re here to change your life little flat fish. Say my name without a stutter and you will have your wish”.

A cold shiver flooded over Kip’s scales; this was his one chance, his only chance to win over the fish of his dreams, sally salmon. 

He stretched out his fins, breathed in deep and let a huge swig of sea water flood over his gills.

He coughed, released the tension in his fins and without so much as a pause, as if his speech problem had never even existed, he let out the words, “the-un-fath-om-able-eight” with blissful clarity.

“granted!” boomed the octopus, And with that, he whirled his burly Tentacles around him and span up a storm of sand and dirt. Kip couldn’t see a thing, but once it settled he noticed something very strange... He felt different, he looked different, “oh shit ” he said, “im a lobster, this feels, this feels incredible!”

“not only can you speak without impediment” said the giant octopus, “i have transformed you into a powerful lobster and the most handsome lobster in all of the ocean.” 

“Not only this, but upon your return home, you will be showered with gold and riches. You’ll be the wealthiest lobster in all the ocean.”

“Sally salmon is surely gonna be impressed with this” said Kip

“To get home, you must take the hole.” Pointing to a tiny black put in the sea bed. “within it there is a mystic ocean current that will guide you all the way back to shallow waters”.

Kip made for the cave opening when the giant octopus boomed, “but beware little lobster, there’s one catch” “you can only use the riches that I have bestowed upon you for your own means.” “if you spend even so much as one piece o' eight on anyone but yourself, you will be immediately turned back into your former self!” 

With that, Kip nodded, gripped his pincers together, shut his eyes and dived into the hole.

Kip didn’t expect what he saw next... Zooming through endless blackness he was suddenly hit with the most spectacular vision of endless twinkly points and extraordinary light waves wooshing passed him. He must have been travelling faster then any fish had ever travelled before, but it looked as though the world was moving even faster around him.

Faster and faster, the twinkles turned into streaks of incredible brightness.

Faster and faster, he could feel his little lobster legs start to flair out of his grasp.

Faster and faster, until everything was one ball of blinding white light.

And with an incredible BOOM, kip was ripped out of the vortex, back into normal waters and gently, he floated back down to the sea bed.

Kip, the adventurer, the most handsome lobster of all the ocean slept.

When he awoke he was back in shallow waters he was sleeping on the biggest pile of gold ever seen by a fish and Sally salmon was right there, staring at him in disbelief.

“Sally” he said, “its me Kip”. Sally couldn’t believe her eyes. Kip spent the next hour convincing her it was really him, and with some old stories and things only kip would know, confused as she was, she realised that this must be Kip.

Amazed by his new coat of shiny armour, new found riches and perfectly clear speech, she asked how this unbelievable transformation took place. Kip, had no choice but to refuse, after all, there was no way on earth he was going back to being that blubbering, stuttering, ugly flat fish. 

weeks went by and After a few dates with Sally, kip realised how difficult and awkward this situation had become. They had gone to dinner and the movies on a number of occasions, but when it came to paying the bills, he would only pay for himself. Kip got to thinking, “What good is all of this wealth if I can only spend it on myself.”

For months Sally kept asking for his secret, “how did you change?” “where did the gold come from?” and for months kip kept his secret adventure from the gal he loved.

One day Sally stopped Kip in his tracks and asked one last time, “kip, you have to tell me, you keep everything to yourself, your money, your secret, tell me what’s going on, I have to know!!”

Knowing full well what he had to lose, kip, once again, refused to spill he secret.

And with that, angry and frustrated, sally said, ""You know what kip, forget it. I used to avoid you because you were an Ass Sole, but now your just fucking Shellfish!”
",Kip the flatfish (long),3

Well, on our hike, we came across something so incredibly sad, it put to bed all of my own problems. There, lying on the trail, was a beautiful and majestic Appaloosa stallion lying on the ground. It had obviously been there for some time and was nearing death. Vultures, silhouetted in the crisp blue sky, circled above.

I looked at the horse; he looked at me. We had an understanding. He wanted us to put him out out of his misery. But before I raised my fist, the stallion rested his head, closed his eyes, and whinnied his last.

Somewhat relieved, I told Ted what we must do now: we had to make sure.

My friend was shocked. He looked over his shoulder frantically ""Who,"" he demanded, ""Who should beat this dead horse?""

I looked him in the eye, placed one hand reassuringly upon his shoulder and said:

At that moment, one of the tribe's warrior put him on all fours and sodomized him like there is no tomorrow. Once the warrior is done, the adventurer is released.

Now it's the turn of the second to make his decision. He thinks: ''Wow, that was something. Anyway, I prefer to be fuck in the ass rather than to die. Furthermore, it can't be that worst than that one time in college''. So he yells: ''I choose the woulawoula''.

Like the first adventurer, the second one is released after being brutally sodomized by one of the tribe's warrior.

Now comes the turn of the third adventurer. He thinks: ''There's no way I'll be fucked like those two faggots. Shame on them. I will keep my honor''. So he yells: ''I choose death''.

In regard of this decision, all the tribe's warriors clump together to form the firing squad. The tribe's chief declares: ''I admire your courage. I sentence you to death, by the woulawoula''.",Three adventurers are captured by a dangerous tribe in the jungle.,42

Artie reaches for it. Right before his fingers reach it, the man snatches it away and laughs. He holds it out again. Artie tries to grab it and the guy snatches it away and holds it up in the air just out of reach. After a few jumps, Artie gives up, eyes burning with frustrated tears. The man grins and promises to let it go this time. Artie reaches for the dollar and the man drops it to the ground, and a gust of wind whips it away.

post,64oexc,2qh72,jokes,false,1491880785,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/64oexc/the_friendly_elephant/,self.jokes,,"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University .

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.",The friendly elephant,10

But most people did not care about John's flowers. They would step on them, ride horses over them, and do many other horrible things to poor John's flowers. One day, a child let his dog relieve himself in the flowers, and that was the final straw for John. 

John began to breed his flowers for a new purpose. He made a flower that when sniffed, would kill whoever sniffed it. He began to offer it to people who destroyed his precious flowers. They would take a sniff, and within a few moments, they would be dead. John would then use the bodies as fertilizer.

The lord of the town began to worry, as many of his subjects were disappearing. He sent out his best knight to find the source. The knight searched high and low. Eventually he wound up at the friar's house. He knocked on the door and asked John whether he had seen anyone who might be killing the townsfolk.

""Ah, good sir knight,"" said John, ""I am but a simple friar, and I only wish to attend to my flowers. Pray tell, wouldst thou perchance wish to smell them?"" The knight, not knowing any better, took a sniff of the flower and died.

The lord began to worry even more, as his knight had not returned. So he sent out his constable. The constable searched high and low, and eventually he too wound up at the friar's house. He knocked on the door and asked John whether he had seen the knight anywhere.

""Ah, good sir constable,"" said John, ""I am but a simple friar, and I only wish to attend to my flowers. Pray tell, wouldst thou perchance wish to smell them?"" The constable, not knowing any better, took a sniff of the flower and died.

The lord was fraught with worry. He screamed, ""Is there no one who can rid me of this curse?!"" A young man stepped forward and offered to find the knight and the constable. The lord accepted and offered him a great reward if he was successful.  Eventually, the young man also arrived at the friar's house. He knocked on the door and asked John whether he had seen the knight or the constable anywhere. 

""Ah, sirrah,"" said John, ""I am but a simple friar, and I only wish to attend to my flowers. Pray tell, wouldst thou perchance wish to smell them?"" But the young man suddenly drew a dagger and killed the friar. He found the knight and the constable buried in the garden and dragged all three corpses back to the lord.

The lord was astounded. ""How did you know he was the murderer?"" He asked. The young man replied, ""The girl I was supposed to marry bought a flower one day, and she died soon after. I could only assume the flower had killed her. I then deduced it must be the friar."" The lord heaped praises upon him and gave him a great reward. He then asked the young man his name. ""Hugh,"" the man replied.

What is the moral of this story?

Only Hugh can prevent florist friars.",Once there was a friar named John,11

He’s the guy who did everything right all the time.  He was a terrific athlete, sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and the piano.  You should have heard him play.  He was an amazing guy.

He had a memory like a computer.  He remembered everybody’s birthday.  He knew all about wine, which food to order and which fork to eat them with.  He never made a mistake, and he knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good.  He would never answer back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too.  He was the perfect man!  He never made a mistake.  No one could ever measure up to Frank.

Frank arrived in hell and God immediately noticed the problem. 

God. ""Frank Feldman? He’s not supposed to be there That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately."" 

The Devil responds, ""No way. We want to keep him here. We like him."" 

God demands, ""If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!"" 

The Devil laughs. ""Where are you going to get a lawyer?""

So he went to a blacksmith and asked him for the strongest chastity belt in the place. The man brought out a strong belt with a hole in the center. The king was skeptical until the blacksmith said, ""Here, put this broomstick in the hole."" The king complied, and the broomstick was chopped off. The monarch happily took the belt, put it on his wife, and headed off to the holy wars.

Ten years later he returned and lined up all his servants to inspect their private parts. Ten of them were now eunuchs. But the king was delighted to see that the eleventh was intact. He put his arm around this faithful follower and asked, ""What can I do to thank you?""

""Ahahaghagha,"" the servant answered.
