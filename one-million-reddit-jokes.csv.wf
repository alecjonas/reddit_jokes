they do to make their days interesting.

went into town and visited a shop.

When we came out, there was a cop writing out a parking ticket.

We went up to him and I said, 'Come on, man,

how about giving a guy a break?'

He ignored us and continued writing the ticket.

I called him an “asshole” . He glared at me and started

writing another ticket for having worn-out tires.

So Mary called him a “shit head”. He finished the

second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first.

Then he started writing more tickets.

This went on for about 20 minutes.

The more we abused him, the more tickets he wrote.

Just then our bus arrived, and we got on it

and went home.

I just remembered a sort of anti-joke that I was told in elementary school, which I was briefly obsessed with. I straight-up just had the recollection of it jolt into my brain, but I can remember so few details, and I want to see if this is something that people know about. There's a good chance the kid who told me just made it up, but if it exists outside of my mind I wanna know what it is!

Unfortunately, I need to be painfully vague as I can only remember a little. The joke had a distinct format to it; there was a character (who may have been the speakers ""cousin"", and may have been named Joe) who everyone knows. This isn't the other ""Everyone Knows Joe"" joke, though. The story has a distinct format whereby the teller starts in on a story about this person's life, as they wake up, go about doing daily tasks or engaging in strange behavior. It changes in the telling, but a reoccuring motif is that, whenever a new character is introduced, the refrain is ""... and they said 'Hi Joe!', because everyone knows Joe.""

You basically keep the story going as long as possible (I vaguely remember flying across the ocean, a whale, and possibly celebrities) until, eventually, anti-climatically, Joe is hit by a car and you end the story with ""And that's why you look both ways before crossing the street.""

Hundreds and hundreds of drawins came on but none could correctly name the actor who played him, then finally I found one person, the only person in the whole school who drew Morse and labelled correctly who played him.

A little boy stood up and said, 'If my best friend is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy.'

'I'm afraid not', said The Prime Minister, 'That's what we would call a great loss'.

The room went silent. No other kid volunteered. The Prime Minister searched the room.

'Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?'

Finally, little Johnny raised his hand from the back of the class and said, 'If a plane carrying you and all the Tory M.P.s was hit by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.'

A commercial comes on for a guaranteed weight loss of 10 pounds in a week. So the guy, thinking what the hell, signs up for it. Next morning an incredibly beautiful woman is standing at his door in nothing but a pair of running shoes and a sign about her neck that reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me."" As soon as he sees her, she takes off running. He tries to catch her, but is unable. This continues for a week, at the end of which, the man has lost 10 pounds. After this he tries the next weight loss plan, 15 pounds in a week. The next morning an even more beautiful woman is standing at the door, in similar conditions. The same happens with her as the first woman, except he almost catches her. This continues for a week, at the end of which he, as suspected, weighs 15 pounds less. Excited about this success, he decides to do the master program. Before he signs up, he is required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan. Still he signs up. The next morning, waiting at the door, is a hulking 300 pound muscle man with nothing but a pair of running shoes, a raging erection, and a sign around his neck that says, ""If I catch you, you're mine!"" The man was supposed to lose 25 pounds in the week; he lost 34.",Overweight guy,114

post,35faxa,2qh72,jokes,false,1431202337,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35faxa/a_fast_running_sister/,self.jokes,,"I was in a USAF training school- one of about 30 students. The instructor had a habit of picking on one of the students, a guy named Sparks because he was very quiet. We sat in groups of 4-5 people at tables. Sparks did not sit at my table. I could tell it bothered Sparks so I went to him one day and asked if he would like to get even with the instructor. He said OK so I told him my plan/joke. 

The next day the Sergeant instructor was standing by my table after giving us an assignment. He made a comment about Sparks again and I said:

Me: ""You should see Sparks outside of class. He talks all the time. In fact you can't shut him up in the barracks.""

Sergeant: ""Oh yea, what about?""

Me: ""His sister. She is going to be in the upcoming Olympics. Apparently she is a really fast runner. Go ahead, ask him about it. He will go on and on and on about how fast his sister can run. It's funny how he will talk about her and how he won't shut up about her.""

Sergeant says loudly across the room to Sparks. ""Hey, Sparks. I hear your sister can run really fast. She going to be in the Olympics?""

Sparks plays the perfect dead pan face. Says nothing at first. I start laughing. 

Sergeant: ""Come on, Sparks. Tell me about your sister. How fast she can run?""

I laugh harder.

Sparks: Very serious looking face finally says ""My sister is a cripple. She lost both her legs in a train accident last year."" 

No one but Sparks and I knew of the joke. A dead silence falls in the classroom except for me as I literally fall out of my seat laughing. The look on the Instructors face is priceless and the class is stunned, particularly the guys at my table. The instructor starts to stammer, face beet red, and I fear he is about to sit on his butt from weak legs. I am crying/laughing right next to the Sergeant. The looks he throws my way are...evil.

Sparks holds a serious expression on his face for what seems a few moments but eventually cracks a smile. The instructor as well as the class finally realize it is a joke and the Sergeant looks at me and says ""Oh... you a-hole. You f'ing...."" but he finally starts to laugh himself telling me is he going to get even with me. He didn't.

Sparks did not have any sisters. He and Sparks got along a lot better after that.

A man is staying in a room at a motel at night in the middle of nowhere, on his way to a different city. Being the only establishment as far as the eye can see, let's just say the management is lax about basic upkeep and maintenance. 

As the man is lying in his moldy bed at night tossing and turning, he realizes the gas-station burrito he's had earlier is going to make a second entrance. He goes to the bathroom, as it were, sees that the ""toilet"" is a hole in the ground that's boarded shut, there is nothing in the way of water supply and toilet paper is a desperate dream.

 The stress of the situation starts manifesting itself on his bowels and he feels that inevitable rumbling in his butt. Looking around frantically and finding nothing to help him, he unzips his carry bag, pulls out a single sock, positions it, and lets the demon turd out. Suddenly feeling better, he even has the time to marvel at the relief flooding through him like he is flooding his sock. Done, he stands up, looks at the sock not knowing what to do with it, and hangs it on one of the more crooked blades of the ceiling *fan* and goes back to bed. 

In the middle of the night he wakes up covered in sweat, and jabs the conveniently placed bed-side fan button, and conks off the moment the first wisps of cool air hit his sweaty body. 

The next morning he's greeted by the nastiest stench that wakes him up scowling, but the shit-mural on all four of his walls is what sobers him up in a hurry. He takes down the offending sock, cleans as much gunk off himself and his belongings and the bed as possible, then calls the up the cleaning lady, and tells her sheepishly, ""I'll give you $200 to clean this up and keep it a secret."" She turns to him and says, ""I'll give you $500 if you tell me how you managed to shit on the wall sideways.""

She decides that she really needs a haircut. She skates into the first salon she sees and goes up to the hairdresser and says, ""I need a haircut.""

The hairdresser checks her out and says, ""OK, sit down and take off your headphones.""

""No way!"" shouts the blonde, ""If I take off my headphones, I'll die!"" ""

Then I can't give you a haircut,"" replies the hairdresser.

So the blonde gets up and leaves and skates further down the board-walk. She sees another salon, goes in, and says to the hairdresser, ""I need a haircut... but you can't take off my headphones or I'll die!""

The hairdresser looks at her a little weird, but says, ""OK, no problem. Have a seat."" So the blonde sits down and the hairdresser comes up behind her, and when she isn't looking, rips the headphones off her head. Suddenly the blonde starts choking, and soon turns blue in the face, then keels over and dies right there in the salon chair. The hairdresser is a little freaked by this. The hairdresser leans over and cautiously listens into the blonde's headphones and hears...

The bartender estimates the distance at 2 meter, realizes his bar seats are quite wobbly and then thinks about how difficult it has been lately to keep his bar profitable. “You’re  on”, he says. “I’ll see your 250.”
So the man gets on his bar seat, undoes his pants and starts pissing all over the bar. He hits the glasses, the bottles, the sink, the bartender… Really everything but the cup.
The bartender smiles relieved and says: “Alright mate, I’ll take thos 250  euros now.”
The man walks  over to a table in the corner with a shitload of empty glasses on it and three men sitting behind it. All of them shake his hand and when he comes back to the bar he  hands the bartender his money with a big smile.
The man behind the bar asks: “Dude, what are you so happy about? You just lost a  bet and a large amount of money.”
The man replies: “I’m laughing because I bet those guys in the corner a thousand euros I could piss all over you and your bar and you would still be laughing after I was done.”

post,35d1ep,2qh72,jokes,false,1431141652,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35d1ep/heaven_is_getting_full/,self.jokes,,"This is my favorite joke. Its a little long but I think it's worth it.

One day God realized heaven was getting pretty full so he went St. Peter at the gates and said, ""Hey, so it's getting kind of full in here so you're gonna need to start filtering who gets in or not by only letting in those who had the worst deaths"". Peter said ok and went to go filter the new arrivals. After explaining the new rules to everyone Peter said, ""So, if anyone thinks their death is worthy than come on up and I'll decide if you get to go in to heaven"". 

The first man walk up and says,""You're gonna have to let me in once you here how I died"" and Peter says, ""Ok, lets here it"". Well I had suspected for a while that my wife was cheating on me. So, the other day, about an hour after my wife thought I had left for work, I came back to my apartment to catch her in the act. I busted through the door and start screaming for them to come out. My wife is alone in the bedroom telling me I'm crazy and that nothing is going on, but I don't believe her. So, I start frantically searching the apartment for this guy. I search all the rooms, all the closets, everywhere! I can't find a single sign that another man had been in my house. I was about to give up when all of a sudden a heard a noise coming from my balcony outside. I go out to the balcony and there he is hanging over the edge. He is screaming that he is losing his grip but I cant control myself. I am filled with so much rage that I start pounding on his hands. I keep hitting and he keeps screaming for me to stop but I continue hitting until finally he falls. He falls all 13 stories and lands in the bushes below. I figured he would be dead for sure but somehow I see him starting to move around. I can't control my anger anymore. All I see is red. With adrenaline running through me I go over to my refrigerator, drag it to the balcony and throw it over the edge. It lands on the man and kills him. But all the pain of wife's betrayal and anger must have been to much for my body because, right then, I had a heart attack and died. Peter, blown away by the story, says, ""You're right, that is a horrible way to go. Head on in.""

The next man walks up and Peter tells him, ""That last guy set the bar pretty high. I hope your story is pretty good."" ""oh, it is"" says the guy. ""I'd bet it's some of the most unfortunate luck you've ever heard of"". My morning started off like every other day. I got up, had some breakfast and then went out for a morning run on my treadmill out on my penthouse balcony. One second everything is great then the next the machine is malfunctioning and speeding up like crazy. I lose control and get launched over the edge of my balcony. I figured I was going to die but managed to somehow grab on to the edge of one of the balconies below. I was hanging there for what seemed like forever, unable to pull myself up, calling for help. I thought nobody was going to come when all of a sudden a man walks onto the balcony. I was so relieved. I asked him quickly for help because I was losing my grip when all of a sudden this man goes crazy and starts hitting my hands for no reason. I can't believe my eyes! Why would someone do this to a complete stranger?! I eventually lose my grip and fall. At this point I knew it was all over and just waited for the end. Yet, somehow I landed in bushes below and survived. I figured I must be the luckiest man alive until I looked up and saw a fridge barreling down towards me and BOOM... that's all she wrote. ""...wow"" said Peter ""You were right. Go ahead and enter. You deserve it""

Right as that man was leaving another walked up. Peter turns to the man and says, ""Hey, I'm pretty sure I've heard everything today. I don't think anything could surprise me at this point but go ahead anyways."" The man looks at Peter and says, ""Ok then... picture this; I'm naked, in a refrigerator...""

""What are the conditions, father?"" the cardinals ask him.

""Well"", says the pope ""the first condition is that the woman must be blind, so that she doesn't see who's having sex with her. The second condition is that she must be deaf, so that she doesn't accidentally hear who's having sex with her. The third condition is that she must be mute, so that even if she finds out who had sex with her, she can't tell a soul.""

The teenager thinks about it for a while but can't figure it out so he pulls out his laptop again and starts frantically searching for the answer. He posts it on all the forums and Facebook. He googles it, uses yahoo, Bing, MSN, and even inputs it into WolframAlpha, but he just can't find the answer.

He finally gives up after several hours and turns to the old man, who had long since fallen back to sleep, and says, ""I  give up, old man."",  as he pulled out a crisp $100 note and hands it to the old man.

""Ok."", he says, ""What's the answer?""

The biker thinks this is hilarious and hands him his beer. He calls all his buddies over to watch.

Bobby comes back with, ""Okay cool, no sweat. I'll call Matt at the DC airport and have him arrange some flights for us.""

The next morning Bobby picks up Jimmy and the two set off to the airport. Bobby is constantly stopping to say hello through check-in until the two board the plane. The two get off the plane and Jimmy follows the crowd to baggage claim and hail a taxi. He turns around and sees Bobby chatting with an airport worker and laughing hysterically.

""Hey Jimmy, can you believe it? Richard's wife just gave birth to twins! Hey Rich, tell Susan I said hello and best wishes.""

Jimmy is stunned. How in the hell? He begins to tell Bobby that they need to grab a cab when Bobby stops him, grabs the attention of another worker dressed in all black. He informs Jimmy that this is an old friend, Peter, who works with the Secret Service. Their....limo.... has already been arranged for them. Jimmy is baffled.

""Still no way you know President Obama.""

Bobby and Jimmy get to the limo and lo and behold, Barack steps out and gives Bobby the biggest of hugs. ""It's great to see you again, brother."" Jimmy cannot believe it. He drills Obama with person questions about Bobby. As expected, Obama knows the answers. The trio spend the day on the town and by the end of it, Jimmy is assured the two are actual friends, yet he is not entirely believing the whole world gimmick.

""Okay, I give it to you. Today was neat. But tomorrow, we go to Tibet to meet the Dalai Lama.""

Sure enough, the next day follows as the last. They're greeted off the plane by a friend of Bobby who drives them straight to His Holiness's quarters. There, they spend the afternoon chit-chatting and catching up; all the while, Jimmy's jaw is on the ground from disbelief.

""Alright man, one last test. We head off to Vatican City tomorrow. I want you to introduce me to the face of the Catholic Church - Pope Francis.""

The third day starts off quite like the other two. Once they've arrived in the Vatican City (through a series of flights and private taxi rides from Bobby's friends), Bobby informs Jimmy that the Pope is quite busy today. He's scheduled to deliver a speech to the Papal Audience and won't have much time to entertain both guests. Bobby says that he'll make his way to the Pope (connections can get you anywhere) and when he and the Pope come out on the balcony, he'll have the Pope bless Jimmy directly.

Jimmy is stunned. There is absolutely no way, he's just gotta see it to believe it. He finds his place in the crowd and begins to wait. The crowds file in, full of devoted believers and eager tourists. As the time nears for the Pope to address his church, Jimmy sure enough sees Bobby by his side. His heart is racing! It isn't possible he thinks, there's is just no way.

Suddenly, an obvious tourist walks behind Jimmy and taps him on the shoulder. Jimmy, not wanting to miss his blessing, quickly asks ""What ya need, buddy?""

The tourist looks baffled and emphatically asks Jimmy... ""Hey man, who the fuck is that up there next to Bobby?!""",Jimmy and Bobby are talking over coffee. Bobby casually mentions he knows every person on Earth...,3

The theory of Hot Chick Inverted Naval Vapor Intestinal Theory of Elimination

(HC INVITE)

Under the practice, beautiful women do not eliminate feces in the same manner as men. Rather, beautiful women possess a trait that is linked to beauty on chromosome 9. The trait grants beautiful women an inverted intestinal tract, such that the belly button (naval) of the beautiful women is the sole elimination medium, rather than the anus.

The waste matter passes through the inverted intestinal tract, where, as it approaches the naval, extremophilic enzymes target the waste and generate heat, thereby converting it from solid form to an invisible vapor. At the same time, additional enzymes act upon the transforming waste, such that it loses all scent.

The end result is that an invisible, odorless vapor is released through the naval and passes into the air around with absolutely no environmental or social consequences. This form of elimination is deemed most ""noble"", as it happens absolutely naturally and results in no disgusting expletives from men that otherwise would presume beautiful women poop.

On the other hand, unattractive females do not possess the linked gene on chromosome 9--as a result, they do not have inverted intestinal tracts, and such are forced to eliminate through the traditional ""pooping"" practice.

One night the wife decided she's had enough and would teach him a lesson. As they're eating dinner she says to him that she'd heard that men who behaved like him have been known to shit their guts out. ""You don't want to shit your guts out now do you?"" Again, he waves his hand and says ""I don't believe in those wives tales"".

The next night he came stumbling home again as his wife was making a chicken in the kitchen. He stumbles up the stairs, disrobes and passes out in bed as usual. The wife then takes the chicken innards and scatters them on the bed between his legs. 

A couple hours later the man comes downstairs for dinner and says ""You know, those wives tales were right. I actually shit me guts out"".

""So are ya gonna quit yer drinkin then"" she says.

The man then says, ""Nay, it was a tough go but I was able to get em back in just fine.""

One day, a tad over-zealous with his bell-ringing, the armless man reared back too far and ended up falling out of the bell tower. He hit the ground hard, and died instantly.  A crowd formed around his body, and a woman got down on her knees to take the armless man's head into her arms.

And never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.

FOR EXAMPLE

One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, 'I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.'

I said, 'WHAT??!! What was that?!'

So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...

'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.'

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?'

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.'

We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.

I think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.

Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.'

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?'

I then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.'

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?'

Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either..😂😂😄😃",Venus vs Mars,217

The three nod in agreement, as while they were good people, they all recognized their differences within their faith.

The Catholic is first. When the gates to Catholic Heaven open, they sees a less-than-ideal heaven. The Catholic says ""God, you have taught me to be thankful for all that I have. I know that I should be thankful for what you give me in salvation.""

The Lutheran is next. The doors to Lutheran Heaven open up, and a place filled with happy people, but with homes of mud and clothes made of rags. The Lutheran says, ""God, I you have taught me to be thankful for everyone I have. I know that this is the true meaning of salvation.""

The Protestant is last. The doors to Protestant heaven open up to reveal a heaven that is absolutely perfect, to ones wildest dreams, but the entirety of it is covered in animal feces. The Protestant says ""God, you have taught me to be strict and righteous. This is insulting and I believe you have forsaken me.""

St. Peter smiles at the three of them and says: ""That was a test of faith. Heaven is just past me."" He looks at the Protestant. ""As for you, we realize that our test was decieving, but we know you have been a good person. So we are testing this idea: an imperfect heaven for those not perfectly faithful. Welcome to Lutheran heaven!""","A Catholic, a Lutheran and a Prodestant die and go to heaven.",2

""No."" replied Jimmy ""However, I can ask the teacher!"" and with that jimmy was off to ask his teacher.

""Mrs. Teacher, my friend asked me a question and I don't know the answer, would you happen to know the answer?"" Jimmy asked.

""I may, what is the question Jimmy?""

""What is purple passion?""

When Jimmy asked his question, the teacher's face turned red with outrage, and she ordered him to go to the principal's office.bWhen Jimmy arrived at his office, the principal asked why he had been sent to him.
""Sir, I was playing on the playground and my friend asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, and she sent me here.""

""What was the question young man?"" The principal asked Jimmy.

""Sir, do you know what purple passion is?""

The principle stared at Jimmy in stunned silence for a moment, then phoned Jimmy's father and told him Jimmy was to be suspended immediately and indefinitely, and that he would need to be picked up as soon as possible.
When his father picked him up, he was reasonably upset.

""Son, the principal would not tell me why you were suspended, other than that you used some very inappropriate language. What happened?""

""Well, I was playing on the playground with my friend, when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, who got mad at me and sent me to the principal, when I told him what I asked her, he called you and told me I was suspended.""

""So what did you ask, son?""

""Dad, do you know what purple passion is?""

His dad, usually a quite serious man, burst out laughing, having to pull over to avoid an accident. When he finished, he said ""Son, I think I have to divert your question to your mother, ask her when you get home.""

At this point little Jimmy was getting pretty curious about this 'purple passion', but he was a good boy and listened to his parents, so when he got home he went straight to his mother.

""What are you doing home? Did school release early today?""

""No mother, I got suspended.""

""WHAT? Why did you get suspended?""

""Well, I was playing on the playground with my friend, when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, who got mad at me and sent me to the principal, when I told him what I asked her, he called dad and told me I was suspended, and then dad picked me up and asked me why I was suspended, so I told him what I asked the teacher and he laughed and he told me to ask you. So mom, what is purple passion?""

His mother had never looked so furious in his life as she did when she ordered him to his room and told him not to come out until called for. He spent a few hours in there before his older brother snuck in the window.

""Whoa, little man, what are you doing here? You skippin too?""

""No brother, I was playing with my friend at school and he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher who got mad and sent me to the principals office, and when I asked him he called dad and suspended me, I asked dad on the ride home and he told me to ask mom, I asked mom and she grounded me. Maybe you will know big brother, what is purple passion?""

With this a mischievous grin crept onto his brother's face.

""Oh man little bro, you got yourself in deep. The only person that can answer your question is the Sheriff.""

The family knew the local police well, living only a block away from their combination firehouse/precinct building. So little Jimmy climbed out of the window with his brothers help and went on his own to ask the sheriff. When he arrived the sheriff was sitting at his desk, and was duly surprised at seeing the boy.

""Little Jimmy, what brings you here, on a school day no less? Are you turning yourself for truancy?"" With that the Sheriff chuckled.

""No sir, I was playing with a friend at school when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, she got mad and sent me to the principal, I asked him and he called my dad and suspended me, I asked my dad on the way home and he told me to ask my mom, she grounded me when I asked her, and my brother, who is a skipper, came in the window so I asked him, he told me only you would be able to answer the question.""

Intrigued, the Sheriff asked him to repeat the question.

""Mr. Sheriff, what is purple passion.""

Without hesitation the sheriff pulled out his gun and put some lead between little Jimmy's eyes. But this was not the end of little Jimmy. The next thing he new he was staring at St. Peter at his podium in front of the pearly gates. Looking a little stunned, St. Peter spoke after referencing his book.

""Son, it says here you were shot by a sheriff, what did you do to deserve that?""

""Well Mr. St. Peter sir, I was playing with a friend at school and he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, the teacher got mad and sent me to the principal and the principal got mad, called my dad and suspended me. On the way home I asked my dad, he laughed and told me to ask my mom, when I got home I asked my mom and she grounded me, then my brother snuck back home and I asked him, he told me to go to the police place and ask the sheriff. I asked the sheriff and I think he shot me.""

""What did you ask the sheriff, Jimmy?""

""I don't want to say.""

""Come little one, I doubt it could be that bad.""

""Ok, Mr. St. Peter sir, what is purple passion?""

With that the clouds opened up beneath Jimmy's feet, and he fell for what seemed like years. When he finally landed he was in hell. He wandered around for a while before running into a succubus. Very curious, she asked ""Kid, what the hell are you doing in hell?""

Shocked that he was in hell, the story just fell from his lips ""I was playing with a friend when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, she got mad and sent me to the principal, who suspeneded me when he heard the question, so I asked my dad on the way home who laughed and told me to ask mom, my mom got mad and sent me to my room where I met my brother sneaking back in, so I asked him and he told me to go ask the sheriff so I asked the sheriff and the pig shot me, so I asked St. Peter and he sent me to hell. Ms. Demon lady, do you know what purple passion is."" 

Her face went stony and she pointed at a building in the distance. ""All such questions are to be directed at Lucifer himself.""

Very scared, but wanting an answer, Jimmy made the long trek to the Devil's office. When he arrived Lucifer was in the middle of some paperwork, but looked up just a tad bit surprised.

""Little Jimmy, I wasn't expecting you before your brother, what brings you to hell?""

""Well I was playing in with a friend at school, and he asked me a question. I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, the teacher got mad and sent me to the principal, the principal suspended me after I asked him so I asked my dad, my dad laughed and told me to ask my mother, when I asked mom she grounded me, and my brother snuck into the room so I asked him as well, but he told me the only person allowed to answer the question was the Sheriff, so went to the police building and asked him, but he shot me, then I was in heaven and St. Peter asked me why I died, and when I asked him the question he sent me to hell, where I met a demon lady who, when asked, told me to ask you. So please, please, please Mr. Devil sir, can you tell me what purple passion is?""

Lucifer starts to laugh, but calms down quickly. ""Little Jimmy, purple passion is a five minute joke with no other purpose than to waste your time.""

TL;DR: You beat the system, congrats.","Little Jimmy was playing with a friend on the playground, when his friend asked him a question....",7

However, they do not want to spend huge amount of money. Therefore, they go to church and hire a priest who is kind of into this stuff. In order to convince him, the board introduce themselves as religious people.

One week after, priest comes back with a video:
Lots of men with helmets and shit are gathered in the middle of nowhere and one of them appears to be banging a nail into something. When the camera closes up, we see that the guys are roman soldiers and the one in the middle is crucifying Jesus Christ.
He turns to the camera and says: ""Wilson nails, so strong!""

The board finds this ad extremely offensive and politely tells the priest that they don't want to see cross and jesus in their ads.

The next week, our priest comes with another video:
Hundreds of men with helmet and shit are gathered around the Eiffel Tower. One banging a nail onto the tower. When the camera zooms in, we see that he crucifies Jesus Christ onto Eiffel Tower. He turns to the camera and says ""Wilson Nails! Very effective! Even on metal!"".

The board gets angry and politely says that he does not want any fucking crucifying in a fucking nail ad.

The priest, for the last time brings another video a week after:
The video starts. Nothing happens. Only a desert...
Then, a man appears with beard and long hair. He screams and runs with blood all over himself.
A few seconds later, shitloads of roman guys appear on the screen running as fast as they could.
One of the soldiers turns to the camera and says:

The Jew replied, and told the leader ""Ven I came to this country they give me a job, sit under this tree and warn people, dont go over the hill! Over the hill is a bacon tree.""
""A bacon tree?"" asked the wagon train leader. 
""Yah, ah bacon tree. Trust me."" 
The leader went back and tells his people that it's just some crazy Jew saying something about bacon.

So the wagon train goes up the hill and down the other side. Suddenly, Indians attack and massacre everyone except the leader, who manages to escape back to the old Jew.
The near-dead man starts shouting. ""You old fool!  You sent us to our deaths, why didn't you warn us!! We went over the hill but there was no bacon tree. Just hundreds of Indians, who killed everyone.""

Three men are standing outside the pearly gates and out comes St Peter.

""Sorry Guys, but Heavens pretty full today, so I can only let one of you in.  So for this reason, who ever of you had the worst death gets to come on in.""

So the first guy steps forward and recounts his story. 

""Well it all started when I thought my wife was cheating on me, so I came home early one day from work to catch her in the act.  As I suspected I found her flushed and naked on the bed, so in my rage I ransacked my apartment searching for the guy she had obviously been cheating on me with.  I searched high and low and to no avail could not find him.  So I went out to the balcony to get some fresh air and what do you know hanging of the edge of my balcony is this guy.  So I started banging on his hands and he wouldn't let go, so then I stomped on his hands and he fell down into the bushes below.  Then in my rage I grabbed the bar fridge and threw it over the balcony at him.  Subsequently the stress and physical strain caused me to have a heart attack.  So here I am""

Saint Peter then instructs the second man to tell his tale of woe.

""Well my day was going like any other, I was doing my exercises on my balcony but it had rained and unfortunately I slipped and fell over the railing.  I fell for a bit but I managed to grab onto the balcony below.  I injured myself during the fall and I couldn't manage to pull myself up, but then a guy came out and I thought he was going to save me.  But no! He started hitting my hands.  I tired to hold on but eventually let go and landed in some bushes.  I thought it was a miracle until Bang! The bastard threw a fridge at me and I died instantly.""

The third man steps forward.

Who ever in the whole world would dream of getting a real Partridge in a Pear Tree? How can I ever express my pleasure. Thank you a hundred times for thinking of me this way.

Dearest John:

Today the postman brought your very sweet gift. Just imagine two turtle doves. I'm just delighted at your very thoughtful gift. They are just adorable.

All my love, Agnes

When I opened the door today there were actually six geese laying on my front steps. So you're back to the birds again huh? These geese are huge. Where will I ever keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through the racket. Please stop.

What's with you and those freaking birds?? Seven swans a swimming. What kind of damn joke is this? There's bird poop all over the house and they never stop the racket. I can't sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck. It's not funny. So stop those freaking birds.

Now there's ten ladies dancing. I don't know why I call those sluts ladies. They've been balling those pipers all night long. Now the cows can't sleep and they've got diarrhea. My living room is a river of shit. The Commissioner of Buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why the building shouldn't be condemned.

I'm calling the police on you! Agnes

Listen Fuckhead:

What's with those eleven lords a leaping on those maids and ladies? Some of those broads will never walk again. Those pipers ran through the maids and have been committing sodomy with the cows.

After a couple of hours and many drinks, he notices a huge jar on a shelf behind the bar full of $50 notes. He calls the bartender over and asks ""Wtf is that jar full of $50 for?"". The bartender moves the jar onto the bar and says ""You put $50 in the jar. If you can complete 3 tasks the jar is yours"" 
Never one to refuse a challenge, the man pulls $50 from his wallet and drops it in the jar. ""Okay"" says the bartender as he grabs a bottle of rum, ""The first task is to drink this entire bottle within 10 minutes"". The man struggles but gets the whole bottle down with time to spare. ""What's next?"" he slurs, clearly extremely drunk. ""There is a dog chained up out back, he has a rotten tooth that needs pulling, and he is one mean mother-fucker. When you're done with that the third task is waiting for you upstairs, see my grandmother lives up there. She is 95 years old and hasn't had sex in a long time, so once you fuck her the prize is yours"". 
The man stumbles out the back and a few moments later the bartender hears the dog beginning to yelp in pain. 10 minutes later the man walks back in to the bar with a triumphant look on his face and yells ""DONE!

In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course as Sinko de Mayo.

""An lemme tell YOU,"" says Clarence, ""Da day you cross dis here river, it'll be da worse mistake o' your life. You'll walk cross dat bridge an you'll be carried back in a pine box!""

For years, similar insults were flung over that river without either of them being mad enough to attempt swimming or boating across to take the other on. 

One day, such a bridge was built and Boudreaux's wife, Clotille, goes to him and starts badgering him. 

""Now Boudreaux,"" she says, ""You been hurlin insults an tellin dat man you was gonna whoop his ass. Dat bridge done been built, yeah! Now you go be a man o' your word or you go over dere an apologize for what you done said!""

She badgered Boudreaux until he agreed. Clotille accompanied him to the bridge until he walked halfway across, stopped, looked up, walked over to Clarence's house, knocked on his door. Clotille couldn't believe what she saw. From the other side of the river, she saw Boudreaux and Clarence seemingly burying the hatchet and shaking hands. When he finally rejoined Clotille she asks, ""Boudreaux! What da hell possessed you to let bygones be bygones wit dat man?""

A little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann’s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course as Sinko de Mayo.",Today is Cinco de Mayo,0

Tired of his boasting, Laura called his bluff, “OK, Colin how about Tom Cruise?” “Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.”

So Colin and Laura fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise’s door and sure enough, Tom Cruise shouts, “Colin! Great to see you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!”

Although impressed, Colin’s friend is still sceptical. After they leave Cruise’s house, she tells Colin that she thinks Colin’s knowing Cruise was just lucky. “No, no, just name anyone else,” Colin says. “President Bush,” his friend quickly retorts. “Yes,” Colin says, “I know him, let’s fly out to Washington.” And off they go. At the White House, Dubya spots Colin on the tour and motions him and his friend over, saying, “Colin, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let’s have a cup of coffee first and catch up.”

Well, Laura is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds she expresses her doubts to Colin, who again implores her to name anyone else. “The Pope,” she replies. “Sure!” says Colin. “My wife is from Italy and because of her I’ve known the Pope a long time.” So off they fly to Rome.

Colin and Laura are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Colin says, “This will never work. I can’t catch the Pope’s eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I’ll come out on the balcony with the Pope.” And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Colin emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Colin returns, he finds that his friend has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Working his way to his friends side, Colin asks her, “What happened?” His friend looks up and says, “I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, “Who’s that on the balcony with Colin?”

&gt;As he neared a lake, he came across a very large male beaver siting at the water’s edge...

&gt;He realized he'd left his gun at home and so he couldn't the magnificent creature.  Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it right at the animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle and went 'bang bang'.

&gt;Miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.

&gt;Now what do you think about that?

asked the doctor.

The 86 year-old said,     
&gt;Logic would strongly suggest that someone else pumped a couple of rounds into that beaver.'

The doctor replied, 
&gt;My point exactly.

Fred then goes into a pet shop and asks for a cocker spankit, the owner is confused and realises he means cocker spaniel (breed of dog).

Finally, Fred walks into a bakery and asks for a bum, once again, staff are confused at first, but realises he means a bun of bread.

So as he is walking down the street with his newly purchased items his brand new dog runs off the leash and Fred runs after it.

Indeed, this desire to have mayonnaise with all meals has influenced the very economy and national psyche. 

In 1858 the Mexican government struck a deal with the government of the United States to have a supply of mayonnaise delivered at once, at wholesale price, to last the entire country of Mexico for one year.

It was to be delivered by ship from the centre of mayonnaise production at the time, New York. The ship would travel down the East Coast of the US, round the Florida Keys, across the Gulf of Mexico and land on the Yucatan peninsula to be distributed.

However a great storm struck the convoy of ships carrying this mayonnaise in the middle of the Gulf, and all of them perished.

Such was the sate of national grief that the President of Mexico at the time ordered a day of national mourning that would be observed every year for time eternal. This would make everyone remember that these ships carrying mayo were sank, and to remember the national depression that remained after wards.

It would be known as the Cinco de Mayo.
