The Pope met with his Cardinals to discuss a proposal from Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel. ""Your Holiness"", said one of his Cardinals, Mr. Netanyahu wants to challenge you to a game of golf to show the friendship and ecumenical spirit shared by the Jewish and Catholic faiths.""

 The Pope thought this was a good idea, but he had never held a golf club in his hand. ""Don't we have a Cardinal to represent me?"" he asked.

 ""None that plays very well,"" a Cardinal replied. ""But,"" he added, ""there is a man named Jack Nicklaus, an American golfer who is a devout Catholic. We can offer to make him a Cardinal, then ask him to play Mr. Netanyahu as your personal representative. In addition, to showing our spirit of cooperation, we'll also win the match.""

 Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made. Of course, Nicklaus was honored and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of the result. ""I have some good news and some bad news, your Holiness, "" said the golfer.

 ""Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus,"" said the Pope.

 ""Well, your Holiness, I don't like to brag, but even though I've played some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful, and my putting was perfect. With all due respect, my play was truly miraculous.

post,6ssuf9,2qh72,jokes,false,1502366635,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6ssuf9/australian_bricklayer/,self.jokes,,"Possibly the funniest story in a long while. This is a bricklayer's accident report, which was printed in the newsletter of the Australian equivalent of the Workers' Compensation board. This is a true story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure....... 
        ---------- 
        Dear Sir, 
        I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put ""poor planning"" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient. 
        I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. 
        You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in section 3 of the accident report form. 
        Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience pain. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body. 
        Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains the two broken legs. 
        I hope this answers your inquiry.",Australian Bricklayer,26

When he is fully undressed she instructs him to lie down on the table. The man obeys. The nurse then takes all of her clothes off and climbs on top and has her way with him.

Upon the completion of the act the man catches his breath and asks what that was all about. The nurse informs the patient that studies have shown that before a vasectomy, if the man has an ejaculation, he will be more relaxed and that the cord will be easier for the surgeon to locate and sever, thereby making the surgery safer, more efficient and quicker.

The nurse then wheels the patient to the operating room. While they are going down the hall the patient looks through a window to the right and sees six men in a room masturbating furiously.

Curious, the man asks,” What are they doing in there”?

'Sure, but the music might be unfamiliar to you because I only play my own compositions'

'That's no problem, take it away'

The pianist begins to play the most emotionally stirring piece of music the manager has ever heard. It's achingly beautiful and almost brings a tear to the managers eye.

Choking back tears the manager says 'That is beautiful, what to do you call it?'

The pianist replies 'I fucked your mother in the ass and she shit on my balls'

The manager is slightly taken aback and says

'Well that is quite the title...Can you play something else?'

The pianist begins to play. Again the music is hauntingly beautiful, it's as though angels from heaven were dancing on the keys

The manager, again holding back tears asks what it's called. The pianist replies

'There's blood on my cock from fucking your slut sister on her period'

The manager is again taken aback and asks him to play a final piece. This piece is even more beautiful than the last, and again the manager asks what it is called. The pianist replies

'You shoved your shit into your grandmothers cunt, while I fucked your grandfather in the mouth'

The manager replies 

'Well, I'm going to have to hire you even if your titles are somewhat unusual. You can start this Friday'

So Friday rolls around and the pianist arrives and is seated at his piano about to play when a woman with huge breasts and a low cut top walks by. The pianist is intensely aroused, and quickly runs off to the toilet to masturbate. He quickly finishes and is running back to the piano, unfortunately forgetting to clean himself up properly.

""And it's a pretty wily one, too. Every time I try to yank it out, it just darts away. I'm gonna have to resort to more unorthodox methods...""

The man doesn't like the sound of that, but he's desperate to get rid of the problem. 

""I want you to come back tomorrow. Bring a banana and a cookie.""

""But why?"" the man says.

""Just do it.""

So the guy leaves. The next day he comes back with a banana and a cookie. ""Alright. Bend over. And brace yourself. This is gonna hurt like hell.""

The guy bends over and the doctor jams the banana right up his ass until it's completely gone. The guy hollers in agony. ""What the hell doc!?""

""Trust me!"" the doc says. 

The doctor checks his watch, and exactly ten minutes later, he tells the guy to bend over again. The guy does, and the doctor jams the cookie up his ass. There are even more howls of pain and anguish. But the doctor tells him to pull up his pants and head home. ""But come back tomorrow with another banana, and another cookie.""

""You gotta be shittin' me, doc!""

""Trust me!"" the doc says.

So away the guy goes, and he comes back the next day with a banana and another cookie. The same thing happens, along with equal amounts of screaming in agony. The doc jams the banana up the man's ass, and ten minutes later, the cookie. The doc tells him to come back again the next day with another banana and cookie, and the next day, and the next day.

""Doc, I can't take much more of this..."" the guy whimpers after a week.

""Trust me,"" the doc says. ""Not much longer now.""

Finally after two weeks of bananas and cookies, the doc tells him, ""Come back tomorrow with a banana and a hammer.""

""Oh no!"" the guy says, turning pale with fright. ""A goddamn hammer?""

""Trust me,"" the doc says.

""Well, I've come this far. And this tapeworm is driving me nuts. It can't get much worse.""

So he comes back the next day with a banana and a hammer. As usual the doctor crams the banana right up his ass, to much howling and screaming. Then he waits 11 minutes. 

Suddenly, the little tapeworm pokes his head out of the man's asshole and says, ""Hey! Where the fuck's my cookie!?""

We hiked about two miles, and came across an old farm house. We walked up, and knocked on the door.

A grizzled old farmer answered, and asked what he could do for us. We told him about our car, and that we needed a place to stay for the night.

He said yes, on the condition we do no touch his 2 daughters, and we agreed.

Later, after the farmer had fallen asleep, and as we're getting ready for bed, two gorgeous women enter our room, start stripping, and proceed to have sex with me and my friend.

The next morning, I see that my friend is gone. I get dressed, and go downstairs. 

The old farmer hands me a cup of coffee, and asks how my sleep was.

Me: It was wonderful sir! I haven't slept so good in ages!

Farmer: Glad t'hear it, son. Say...I have a beautiful fruit garden out back, I already told your friend to help himself to 100 pieces of whatever fruit he wants! Why don't you do the same!

Me: Thank you, sir! I love fruit. I'll take 100 grapes!

So I go out, pick 100 beautiful juicy grapes, come back inside only to see the old farmer holding a shotgun.

Farmer: You broke the agreement. Start shoving those grapes up your ass!

Panicking, I start shoving grapes up my ass. I get up to 25, and start to giggle. The old farmer points the gun closer. I get to 50, and let out a loud snort of laughter. 

Farmer: Less laughin', more shovin'!

I get up to 75 grapes, and start laughing uncontrollably. I have tears in my eyes I'm laughing so hard! The farmer starts to giggle himself, and asks me what the hell is so damn funny.

The new guy climbs the tower and starts scanning the horizon.  Soon, he looks down at the couple and yells, ""Hey! No fucking!""

""We're not. We are cleaning fish!"" They reply.

A little while later, from the watchtower they hear, ""Hey! Stop fucking down there!""

""We are only chopping firewood!"" The couple reply.

By and by, from the watchtower again, ""Hey! I thought y'all weren't fucking!""

""We aren't!"", they yell.  ""We are sharpening sticks!""

After a time, the husband of the couple climbs the tower. ""Alright, new guy.  Get some rest.  I'll take over from here.""

The new guy climbs down.  After awhile, the husband looks down.  ""Ha... It DOES look like they're fucking from up here!""  ",A husband and wife were in a shipwreck and ended up on a desert island...,597

She is so impressed by Johnny's new found work ethic that she offers him a deal. If Little Johnny gets a perfect score, she will buy him a car of his choosing!

Low and behold, Little Johnny gets a perfect score. He shows his mother the letter from the college board and tells his mother that he would like a Ferrari. In shock, but not about to go back on her word, his mother sells some assets and purchases a brand new Ferrari.

When she arrives home with the car, Little Johnny can't wait to get behind the wheel! He runs outside and asks his Mom for the keys. Knowing that she has the keys to Little Johnny's dream car, she decides to have a little fun.

She says - ""Little Johnny, if you want me to give you the keys, you have to mow the lawn first."" So Little Johnny goes and mows the lawn. After he finishes, he asks his mother for the keys again...

She says - ""Little Johnny, if you want me to give you the keys, you have to clean your room and do the dishes"". Little Johnny is annoyed, but he REALLY wants those keys! So Little Johnny goes inside to clean his room and do the dishes. After he finishes, he asks his mother for the keys again...

She says - ""Little Johnny, if you want me to give you the keys, you have to sweep all the floors, take out the trash, water the plants, organize the garage, and prepare dinner for the evening"". Little Johnny is furious. He can't take it anymore. At the top of his lungs, he screams...

She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, “I am so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”

Bill thought for a while and said, “I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.” Hillary was shocked, but said, “Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behavior. However, since you are addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”

Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, “So why do you have all that money in the box?”

Bill answered: “Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash.”",When Bill and Hillary first got married,1210

Rod loved this gift a lot and treated the pole like a friend. They bonded over many hours of fishing and Rod taught his fishing pole about how to socialize.

One day, Rod decided to teach the pole humor. The pole eagerly absorbed this knowledge and decided to learn more about humor. One of the types of comedy he learned was comedy at the expense of others. When he learned about this, he started making many jokes at Rod's expense.

However, he would never make these jokes around Rod. He always posted them on Reddit instead and he would repeatedly brag about how Rod could never find out about the disparaging comments.

This proved not to be the case, as one day Rod found his fishing pole posting mean jokes about him. He did some research on the account and found hundreds of these similar jokes, all found in the r/jokes comments section.

The next day, Rod confronted his fishing pole and asked, ""Why do you keep posting these mean jokes about me and bragging about how I'll never find them because they're just comments?""

To which the fishing pole responded, ""It's because any joke about fishing Rods has to be about how the reel joke is always in the comments.""",A Fisherman's Tale,1

John and Bob were going to California to spend some time at the beach. As they were driving through the desert their car hit a sand dune and flipped. Bob was killed instantly, and John barely made it out alive. Since Bob and John had not planned for a long drive they had packed very little food and water. John was only able to find a small bottle of water for his journey. So in the heat of the desert John started to trek to the nearest town. On the first day John made good progress and only drank about a fourth of his water. The next day he was very tired and drank almost his entire bottle and made very little progress. On the third day he was had finished his water and was barely able to walk. When he was just about to give up and face death, he spotted a giant snake in the distance. He stumbled over to the snake and asked where the nearest town was. The snake replied that it was still about 50 miles away and that John stood no chance of reaching it alive. Now the Snakes name was Nate and he was no ordinary snake. Nate told John that he could grant him three wishes, but with each wish their would be a consequence to come with it. The first wish would come with the consequence of Nate bitting John. The second wish would come with the consequence of a great responsibility. The third and final wish would come with the consequence of the greatest responsibility of all. John agrees because he stands no other chance of survival. So Nate asks John what he wants for his first wish. John is unsure so he asks what people normally wish for, Nate replies that most people wish for infinite endurance so they can escape the desert. John agrees with that so Nate bites him and John gains infinite endurance. Nate then asks John what he wants for his second wish, John is unsure so he asks Nate what most people ask for. Nate replies that most people ask for infinite strength and John agrees. Nate then gives John infinite strength and gives him a great responsibility. The responsibility is to take care of Nate's son Jake. Nate tells John to show Jake the world and to keep him safe at all times. Finally John has the option to ask his final wish. John again asks Nate what most people choose. Nate replies that most ask for infinite wisdom. John of course agrees. Nate gives John infinite wisdom and the greatest responsibility of the world. Suddenly a lever comes out from under the sand. Nate explains to John that this lever is the most important thing in the entire world. One pull of this simple lever and everything on the world would be destroyed. Nate makes John promise that if the world is ever so bad and evil he will pull this lever. Now John is a man who holds true to his promises and responsibilities. The next years were full of adventures and excitement for John and Jake. They traveled the world together and saw so many crazy things. One day when they were camping in the wilderness Jake was attacked by a bear. Only by Johns infinite strength Jake barely made it out alive. After his near death experience Jake realized that he had barely spent anytime with his father Nate. Jake explained this to John and said he wanted to be with his father more. John agreed and proposed the idea of buying a large camper and taking Nate on all their journeys with them across the world. Jake loved the idea so John and Jake bought a camper and headed to the desert to pick up Nate. Since it had been years since they last visited Nate, John had trouble finding him. Finally as John drove over a dune he saw Nate and the lever standing at the bottom of the dune. In Johns excitement he sped up the camper to a whopping 80 mph. This however was a horrible idea because he lost control of the camper and its brakes gave out. John was headed straight for the Lever and Nate. Now John had only two choices; turn the camper and hit Nate or hit the lever and kill all mankind. John in all his infinite wisdom knew that he could not hit the lever. Jake was crying and so were John and Nate, but they all knew, better Nate than lever.",Nate the Snake,5

After a few weeks of his imagination tormenting him about the girl he finally worked up the nerve to ask her out on a date.  After dinner and a movie he parked at a lonely spot and they began making out. 

Just as he was about to slip his hand in her pants and answer all his questions she stopped him and said, ""Uh, just a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.""  And went around behind the car and squatted down. 

Thinking this may be his only chance, Johnny slipped out and crawled under the car to see what he could see. Sure enough in the moonlight he could see something hanging down between her legs. In the excitement of finally having his questions answered, Johnny reached out and grabbed it.

""Do you have any hawthes fauw thale?"" he asks the horse breeder.
""Why, sure we got horses. Are you looking for anything in particular?"" asks the farmer.
""Lemme thee the meeyaths"" says the little fellow. 
The horse farmer walks the man out to the horse stables and he points to the mares. ""Females are on the right side of the barn.""
The small man asks to see a gray mare up close. ""That one thaya. Lemme thee ha up cwothe.""
The farmer brings a tall, beautiful gray mare out into the center of the barn for inspection.
""Oh wow. Sheeth pwetty. Lemme thee ha teef.""
""Her teeth?"" asks the farmer.
""Yeah, I wanna thee ha teef. Jutht hold me up to ha mouf tho I can thee ha teef.""
The farmer lifts the small man up to the horse's mouth and his prospective client gently folds back the mare's lips to inspect the animal's teeth.
""Oh yeah, theeth teef look nithe. Now lemme thee ha eerth."" 
The farmer holds him up higher, and the man inspects the horse's ears.
""Yep, yep. Thith ith a nithe mayeh.""
The farmer puts the man down and he circles the horse, inspecting every inch.
'Now, i'd like to thee ha twat.""
'Her what?' asks the farmer.
'Ha twat. I might bweed ha, tho I need to thee ha twat.'
Now, this is a fine mare, and the little man clearly knows that he is buying a fine breeder, so the farmer obliges. He lifts the little man up, and turns his head away so he doesn't need to watch this part of the inspection.
The little man yells, but his voice is muffled due to the fact that his face is planted firmly in the horse's genitals. The farmer puts the man back on the ground and looks at him, obviously disgusted.
'Why'd you put me up theya? I thaid I wanna thee ha twat!""

They would sell those things to buy food to sustain the family. One day, the father wakes up and looks out to the field and sees the cow dead on the ground. He lost hope and hung himself in he closet.  Next, the wife woke up and saw the dead cow and her dead husband so she ran off and threw herself into the stream.  Then the eldest son wakes up sees the dead cow, his dead father, and he goes over to the stream and sees her mother wash up on the bank. Not knowing what to do, he plopped on a rock and sulked for a while when a gorgeous leprechaun walked out from behind a tree.
“You’re having a rough day?” She asks.
“I should say so.” He sighs.
“How about I make you a deal? If you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, I’ll bring everyone back to life, including the cow. Now what do you say to that?”
The boy nodded and said, “Well look at you- you’re young and good looking. I think I’ll give it a go.”
They start but unfortunately he doesn’t quite make it so she kills him and throws him into the river.
Later on the next son wakes up, sees the dead cow, his dead father, and his dead mother and brother both on the bank of the stream. The leprechaun reveals herself again and gives him the same offer, “If you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, I will bring everyone back including the cow.”
The boy nods his head, “I guess I can try. I have nothing to lose.”  So he gives it a shot but he too doesn’t make I so she kills him and throws him in the stream with his brother and mother.
Finally, the youngest son wakes up. He just turned 17. He sees the cow dead, his father, mother and two brothers dead and then spies that gorgeous female leprechaun standing there.
“Having a bad day?” She says.
The boy nods and sighs, “I guess I am.”
“How about I make you a deal? If you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, I’ll bring everyone back to life including the cow.”
He thinks on it saying, “Hmm that’s tempting but what if I was to make love with you fifteen times in a row?”
She laughs for a bit then says, “If you were to do that, I would put a large mansion where your tiny hut is now and I would bring everyone back to life, including the cow.”
The boy ponders, “That’s great and all, but what if I was to make love with you twenty times in a row?”
The leprechaun nearly in tears says, “If you were to do that, I’d bring everyone back to life including the cow, I’d put a mansion where your hut is now, and I’d get you a bottomless pot of gold so you never run out of money.”
The boy I elated, “Ok we have a deal! But before we start, I just have to ask, if I was to make love with you twenty times in a row without stopping, what’s preventing you from dying from it? The cow did.”",An old farmer lived with his wife and three sons on a farm...,19

post,6skexn,2qh72,jokes,false,1502271798,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6skexn/its_world_war_1/,self.jokes,,"British and German troops are set deep in the French countryside within their respective trenches. Separating them is no man's land, a small field littered with barbed wire, mortar craters, fallen heroes and their armaments.

Shots are being sporadically fired in each direction with no side gaining an advantage. 

It's first light and the British officers are having their dawn meeting.

A senior officer starts the proceedings;

""Well chaps, I don't know about you but I think our current strategy is failing. We need to up our game. We need to outsmart the Jerrys and show them who we are. We need a plan!""

They think for a few minutes while sipping from flasks of hot tea until one junior officer pipes up.

""If I may, Sir. I think I have an idea!""

They all turn to the junior with inquisitive looks across their tired and spoiled faces.

""Well, Sir..."" Continues the junior. ""What is a common German name?""

They all think for a moment until an officer at the back raises his hand. 

""Hans. Hans is a common German name.""

""Ok!"" Replies the junior officer. ""We'll try Hans.""

With this, he picks up his rifle and heads off out of the bunker to the edge of the trench. 
All is deathly quiet as an early morning mist swirls slowly over the bloodstained grass of no man's land. 

The junior officer takes position just under the apex of the trench, cups his left hand around his mouth with his right hand clutching his rifle at the ready.

""HANS! HANS! ARE YOU THERE HANS?!"" Shouts the junior, breaking the silence. 

A moment passes before through the mist, a figure can be seen with his hand up in the German trench. 

""JA!"" Comes the faint reply 

The junior steadies his rifle and squeezes the trigger. 

There is a loud crack as the bullet leaves the barrel, spins across the wasteland and hits its target squarely in the chest. 

There is a small round of applause from the British officers with gleeful faces as one asks him to try it again.

As before, the junior officer cups his mouth and clutches his rifle.

""HANS! HANS! IS THAT YOU HANS!?""

Another figure presents itself across the top of the German trench and the junior makes his shot.

This continues throughout the day and night with the Germans taking tens of casualties.

By the following morning, the German officers realising they were being picked apart, come together for their own meeting.

""Ve arr losing many mens!"" Screams one high ranking  officer, gesturing towards the growing heap of bodies littering the trench. His face growing red with rage.
""Zis cannot continue! Ve needs to play ze English svinehunds at zer own game!""
In his anger, he grabs a junior by the lapels... ""Vat iz a common English name?!"" 

The German junior, squirming, mutters ""John. I zink John iz a common English name?""

""Fine!"" Comes the reply. ""Ve vill try John!""

He snatches a rifle from the clutches of an injured private and climbs to the lip of the trench. 

Cupping his left hand around his mouth and readying the rifle, he calls out across no man's land. 

"" JOHN! JOHN! IZ ZAT YOU JOHN!?""

A faint reply from the British side permeates the quiet...

"" NO IT'S HARRY. JOHN'S HAVING A SHIT. IS THAT YOU HANS!?""

""JA!"" Replies the German officer, standing and putting his hand up.

The Americans reacted with a simple okay.

In the next few months the Moon was turning slightly red. And with each passing month, the Moon was more and more red with Russian astronauts tirelessly painting. The Kremlin was slightly concerned why Americans don't react and are letting that happen, but so far so good, the Moon is getting more red with each passing day.

Finally, upon finishing it's mission, and having the Moon completely red, the Kremlin proudly called the White House and boasted how the Moon is now officially a Russian territory and is a symbol of communism and Russian nation.

It takes up large outdoor areas and usually the majority spaces of parking lots. If you live or have lived in Texas you know how true this is.

The following notes are from an inexperienced ""chili taster"" named Frank who was visiting from the East Coast:

""Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the Budweiser truck when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting. So, I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event.""

**Chili #1 Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili**

Judge #1 ? A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.
Judge #2 ? Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
Judge #3 ? (Frank) Holy Jesus, what the hell is this stuff? You could have dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worse one. These Texans are crazy!

**Chili #2 Arthur's Afterburner Chili**

Judge #1 ? Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.
Judge #2 ? Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.
Judge #3 ? Keep this shit out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

**Chili #3 Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili**

Judge #1 ? Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Needs more beans.
Judge #2 ? A bean-less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.
Judge #3 ? Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I've been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded on my back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer!

**Chili #4 Bubba's Black Magic**

Judge #1 ? Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
Judge #2 ? Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.
Judge #3 ? I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300 lb. broad is starting to look HOT? Just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?

**Chili #5 Linda's Legal Lip Remover**

Judge #1 ? Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.
Judge #2 ? Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
Judge #3 ? My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.

**Chili #6 Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety**

Judge #1 ? Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.
Judge #2 ? The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic. Superb.
Judge #3 ? My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.

**Chili #7 Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili**

Judge #1 ? A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
Judge #2 ? Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.
Judge #3 ? You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye and the world sounds like it's made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slides unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

**Chili #8 Tommy's Toenail Curling Chili**

Judge #1 ? The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.
Judge #2 ? This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild or hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor dude, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?","They actually have Chili cook-offs in many small towns, with guest judges and",4

The following morning, he decides to ask the monks what was going on behind the door.

""Sorry, we can't tell you"" the monks say to him.

""Why not?"" the man asks.

""Because you're not a monk.""

So, the man asks how one becomes a monk.

The man stops and thinks for a while, but finally, decides to take the plunge and make the journey to become a monk.

Years later, the man returns to the monastery, and speaks to the other monks.

""I've completed my journey. I've counted every grain of sand, every blade of grass. I've counted every inch of sky and combed the land, and I've learned the patience that being a monk takes.""

""Very well then"" says the monk.

He hands the man a key to the wooden door. The man opens the door with the key, and behind the large wooden door, is a hallway. At the end of the hallway is an even larger bronze door. Behind the bronze door is an even larger silver door. Behind the silver door is a gold door. Behind the gold door, another wooden door. The man begins to become confused. The cycle repeats until finally, he comes to the final door, and behind it, the loud thumping sound. He opens the final door.

- It shall be done, said the genie, instantly creating ten million hounds on the ship.

The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the men's room when one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the urinal. Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and began hoisting the little boys up one by one, holding on to their 'wee- wees' to direct the flow away from their clothes.

As she lifted one little guy, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually well endowed. Trying not to show that she was staring, the teacher said, ""You must be in the 4th grade.""

He confides his worries to his his best friend. His buddy tells him about this new sex shop that would sell him a dildo guaranteed to keep his wife satisfied while he was out on business.

The next day the businessman walks into the sex shop and is greeted by the greasy man working the counter. "" I've been told you have a dildo that will satisfy my wife so thoroughly, the thought of another man will never cross her mind"". The greasy man grinned a yellow toothed smile. ""I have just what you need. It's called the voodoo dick"". From under the counter he pulled a magnificent dildo adorned with strange markings. ""All your wife needs to do to activate the magic is rub the head and say, voodoo dick my pussy. The dildo will do the rest"". The businessman pays the greasy smut pimp and takes the voodoo dick to his wife. He explains that while he is gone the voodoo dick will keep her satisfied and tells her how to use it. The next morning the businessman leaves for China. 

A few days goes by and the man's wife can no longer control her libido. She needs some dick. Normally she would call an ex for a quick fuck but she was curious what the voodoo could do. She stripped naked, rubbed the voodoo dicks head and said ""voodoo dick my pussy"". The voodoo dick shot from her hand and began fucking the shit out of her pussy. Within moments she was having the most mind blowing orgasm of her life. After the first orgasm subsided the voodoo dick was still pounding away. The woman, fully satisfied, attempted to remove the voodoo dick but it just kept fucking away. She didn't know how to stop it. She came two, three, four times. She couldn't take anymore. In a panic she ran out of her house with the voodoo dick edging her to another orgasm. She ran into the street screaming for help. A police officer just happened to be passing and seeing the naked woman screaming for help, he jumped from his car and ran to help her. ""Help me officer! I can't stop it, i have a voodoo dick inside me!"" The wife screamed. The officer scoffed and said ""Voodoo dick? Voodoo dick my ass"".",Voodoo dick,24

post,6se6ce,2qh72,jokes,false,1502205742,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6se6ce/a_guy_walks_into_rjokes/,self.jokes,,"A guy walks into /r/jokes where he meets a bartender. The bartender offers him a drink. The guy says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get tell the bartender a new joke, then the bartender should provide him a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, since he knows most of the jokes that are posted in r/jokes.


The guy begins his tale. “A horse is sitting at home, watching MTV...”. The bartender thought of stopping him there but then he thought that it would so much fun to stop him at the punchline. The guy continued without knowing that bartender knows the joke.

“The horse was watching a jazz music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""


""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.


Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.”

And then when the man was thinking that with this he would get a free drink, the bartender interjected him and said “Why the long face”.;

Hesitant at first, the man continued as he thought whatever happens he will get a free drink today,

“Well the joke doesn’t end here”

The amused bartender asked him to continue.

So the man continued with his joke

“A duck comes and sits next to the bar and they get to talking about the horrible tragedy that horse had to deal with. Meanwhile, drinking and having a good time. Duck tells horse about her band and how successful they were until their guitarist moved out of the country. Horse and duck decide to go into business together. As they finish their drinks, duck says: ""I’ll pay for the drinks by the way.""

The bartender shouts “Put it on my bill.""

The man was terrified it seemed like the bartender knew every joke, even then he thought he will make him laugh he will tell him something that he doesn’t know

So the man thought for a while and continued,

“The duck then said to the horse that he is a CIA agent and he was doing a background check of him and he came to said he was successfully elected to be one of the next astronauts. Surprised horse didn’t believe him until he showed his badge.


Next day the duck dropped him to the NASA, there he met a rat, a bear and a wolf. 

During his first encounter he knew that they were all jazz musicians and in fact they were the masters in their domain. 

So, for one-year horse trained in various activities like how to survive zero gravity and what to do in various situations, and in night they would they would jam. 

After one year when the director came to meet the new group of astronauts, the horse asked the director, “Why they were selected to the NASA’s moon program”, to which the director replied “

Now the bartender who was a smug, old pirate of a man knows that this is definitely an OC, but he still doesn’t want to agree that this a new joke so he asked, “What did the director said”

The man replied, “well the director told them that will play smooth jazz in the moon to create atmosphere”

The two get together, and in an instant can tell the old Fire is there. Together they rent out a small motel room when, just as they throw off their clothes, the Reaper appears at the foot of their bed.

""Her soul is mine,"" the Reaper declares. ""Her days are through.""

The old man stands up to face the specter.

""Please give us one night,"" he begs. ""We know we're knocking on your door. But even as I become so forgetful about everything else, I remembered her. Let us have one night to consummate what never was.""

The Reaper, in a wave of passion, agrees. ""Listen carefully, mortal: have your night of love, seven hours--or until the sun comes up. Then, I want you to 'lay her to rest,'"" he said, pointing to one of the pillows. Call my name when you are finished.""

The couple cheers and the Reaper leaves.

Several hours later the Reaper hears his name and returns. The elderly man is by his now-dead flame, looking worse for wear.

""How was she?"" The Reaper asks, confused to see the man still upset.

""Great!"" The man replies. ""We went for hours straight. But I think I mixed up your instructions...""",An elderly man reunites with his lost love,15

'Sorry students, your professor has been in a terrible accident and I will be leading this course for the remainder of the year.'
No problem - Suzie looked forward to the opportunity to impress yet another teacher.
The teacher continued, 'I am not familiar with the syllabus for this course, and your teacher is unable to communicate. Well, this is a writing course, so let's just write something. Each of you will submit a play. One scene is due each week for the remainder of the semester. The scenes will be submitted for review each Friday and your final grade will be dependent solely on this play.'
Great, thought Suzie. She was working on a couple of plays anyway.
For the first week, Suzie opened her play by setting the scene. It was about a girl who had just moved to a new city. She described the new city and the girl's emotions - trepidation, anxiety... excitement. Suzie was very excited to submit the first scene.

Scenes were returned with grades and critique on Monday. Suzie's pages were littered with red ink which was concluded with a large 'C' on the final page. Suzie was crushed. She looked to her right, where Tad was beaming at the 'A-' on his page. She read the words, apparently a conversation between Horatio and Marcellus.

'Wait,' she asked, 'are you writing about Hamlet?' What an idea, to explore the Bard's universe and build on those well-known characters.
'Nah,' he replied, 'I didn't write anything. I just submitted the first scene.' 
'And you got an A? The writing teacher didn't recognize Hamlet?'

'Well, my bro had this teacher before. He gave me the heads up.... This sub does not appreciate original content.'",The Bard [Long],255

Tired of her boasting, her boss called her bluff, ""OK, Agnes, how about Catherine Zeta Jones?""

""No dramas boss, Catherine and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Agnes and her boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Catherine Zeta Jones's door, and Catherine shouts,

""Agnes! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Agnes's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Zeta Jones's house, she tells Agnes that she thinks her knowing Zeta Jones was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Agnes says.

""Melania Trump,"" her boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Agnes says, ""Old friends, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Melania spots Agnes on the tour and motions her and her boss over, saying, ""Agnes, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds she expresses her doubts to Agnes, who again implores her to name anyone else.

""The Queen of England,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Agnes. ""I've known Her Majesty for years."" So off they fly to London.

Sure enough, half an hour later Agnes emerges with the Queen on the balcony, but by the time Agnes returns, she finds that her boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making her way to her boss' side, Agnes asks her, ""What happened?""

He invited me round to see the collection so it was a weekend afternoon I went over.
Some were preserved in their original condition but some have been modified by their owners.

The first car he showed me was a beautiful 1950s Ford Crestliner. Spectacular curves and a perfect dark green paint job polished to a shine.

Later he showed me a Lincoln four door convertible. It used to be the backup presidents car and was an exact replica of the car JFK was shot in. He'd kept it just how it would have been on the day of the assassination, dark blue paint job and very pretty.

The last car was not in such good condition, left outside under a tree. The tyres were flat so it sat on the rims and there were birds nesting in the tree so it was covered in guano, as I watched a bird flew off adding another crap to the pile on the car. On top of that there was a line tied around the door post, running up to the house that he used to dry his clean laundry on.

I asked him why, the car was in such an awful condition. ""Well it was a champion amateur racer and has been heavily modified from the base car it was bought as. I bought it after a crash but never got around to repairing it properly. It was originally a Subaru, but since then it's been chopped up, the engines been replaced several times and it's become the ugly mess it is today.

One Thursday evening, as the hunchbacked brother was visiting their mothers' grave, a magical light fell through the trees of the churchyard, and a voice boomed:

– WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON YOUR BACK ?!?

– Ehmm… it's a hunchback…?

– I'LL TAKE THAT !!!

The formerly hunchbacked brother went back and told his brother what had happened. He now stood tall, women started to find him quite attractive, and his whole life changed.

The brother with the clumpfoot wanted to see if he could be changed too, so the next Thursday evening he went to visit the grave of their mother.

He hadn't been there many minutes before a magical light fell through the trees, and a voice boomed:

post,6scizs,2qh72,jokes,false,1502186805,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6scizs/pink_ping_pong_ball/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.
So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.
A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?'
The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.
Finally, the son said, Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.
The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have.
And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls.
The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.
The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.
Father,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.'
The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.
The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.
The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.
Father,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'
The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. A carton of pink ping pong balls?'
A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.
I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.
The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.
Dear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'
The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.'
The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.
The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.
Dearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'
One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.
The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.
The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.
The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.
Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'
It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.
The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.
Father,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.'
That night, the son spent on board the tanker.
The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.
A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.
His father visited the young man in hospital. My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'
Weakly, the son sat up in bed. Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.'
The father held his son's hand tightly. Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'
Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'
The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.
Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.
The son nodded weakly.
The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.
Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested.
The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.
I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.
I- I-'

Undeterred, he spit out the rice and resumed his tongue lashing. Once again, he got a mouthful of rice. Puzzled, but still horny, he started eating her out again. When he got another mouthful of rice, and still no response from the daughter, the salesman gave up and went back to bed. The next morning the salesman told the farmer, ""I have to confess: Last night I went up to your daughter's room."" ""That's okay son,"" replied the kindly, old farmer. ""And I have to confess that I had oral sex with her,"" continued the salesman. ""I ain't got a quarrel with that, son,"" replied the kindly, old farmer.

Lately, however, he's been having trouble talking to her, due to her terribly depressive state; basically, his girl wants to meet a man and start a family but, unfortunately, she happens to be really, really ugly- we're talking short, fat, stinky, with greasy hair and a pock-marked face- and back- both of which are absolutely covered in red, oozing, puss-filled zits...in short, not an attractive girl in any way, shape or form.  

""Well, ok"" says the young woman's dad; ""I get that my girl might not be much of a looker, but hey, at least her and I can get to know each other a bit better...maybe I'll even try suggesting a few things that might help her along a bit better in life...""  

So one day the father sits down with his girl and mentions that maybe she ought to join a gym, or perhaps she could try to get one of those makeovers from someone who knows about those things, or possibly she could volunteer at a burn-unit of a hospital, where she might meet a guy who wasn't so focused on her looks...anyway, on and on he went, all the while trying to cheer up his only child and give her useful suggestions for meeting a man.

Unfortunately, their conversation went nowhere.  After hearing all he had to say, the daughter looked her father square in the eye and said ""look, Daddy, I know you love me- and I know you want me to eventually find someone and settle down- but it's never gonna happen, so just forget it.  A man- especially a permanent man- is simply NOT in my future.""  

""Ok"" her dad replied, ""I get it.  I promise I won't say anything more about your situation- ever.""

A few months pass by until one night the dad- lying in his bed- hears some deep, loud, guttural moaning noises coming from his daughter's room.  Additionally, her bed seems to be pounding against the wall as she screams loudly, over and over and over again.

At this, the dad is overjoyed, figuring that finally, somehow, someway, his little girl has found a man.  In fact, so happy is he that he can't help himself; he bursts into his daughter's room to congratulate her and her new paramour.  Unfortunately, there's nary a man in sight; rather, his daughter is gripping- with both hands- a huge, thick, two-foot high, spiked dildo- one which she had just been ramming in and out of her pussy over and over and over again.  Exhausted and dripping with sweat, she looks at her dad, wide-eyed.  He looks back at her and says, sheepishly, ""honey- I'm sorry- I didn't mean to bust in...I just thought...well...I was just happy to...

""Don't say it, dad- I get it"" replies the girl.  ""Look, Daddy, let's be honest, ok?  I'm so fucking ugly that this (she points to the enormous phallus) is the closest thing to a husband I will EVER have!  EVER!  So yeah, sure- it's pathetic- but I don't care anymore- this thing is all I've got- and all I'll EVER have- so just fucking get used to it, ok?!?""

""Sure, sure- I get it honey"" says the dad.  ""I understand completely.  Look, I'll leave now...and, uh, sorry for interrupting.""  

With that, the dad slinks out of his daughter's room and goes back to bed. 

**EPILOGUE**

A few weeks later the girl comes home on a Sunday afternoon and sees her father, sitting in his favorite easy chair with a drink in his hand, while a sporting event of some kind plays loudly on the t.v.  To his right- on its own makeshift chair- sits her very own oversized dildo- and next to it, a bottle of beer.  

""Dad!"" the girl asks, dumbfounded-- just what the FUCK are you doing?""  

""Oh, sorry honey"" replied her father, ""but since you weren't here and I didn't think you'd mind, I decided I might as well just crack a few beers and watch the game with my new son-in-law.""

But cooler heads prevail and Trump and Putin decide that instead of all that, there will be a dog fight between both nations in one year- and may the best dog win!

 Russia gets right to work creating a super-dog: cross breeding the meanest, nastiest dogs in the world, shooting it up with steroids, training it- until finally they've bred something terrifying and unbeatable.

 The day finally comes and the arena is full- Americans on one side- Soviets on the other. The lights go down, the music blares- and the Russians wheel out their dog in a titanium cage. The dog is huge and is biting at the bars! It can't wait to kill something!

 On the other side, out comes a short man, dressed like Uncle Sam walking a dachshund on a leash.

 The Russians explode with laughter!

 At the given time, the cage door is opened and the Russian dog rushes out to consume the poor, pathetic wiener dog. The crowd comes alive! It's going to be a blood bath!

 The Russian dog leaps! It's not even a contest! But at the last moment, the American dog simply opens its mouth wide and consumes the Russian dog whole in one bite!

 Later, the lead Russian scientist is talking to the head scientist from the American side:

 ""I... I can't believe this! This is impossible! We put everything we had into that dog! It cost us millions!""

 The American smiles- ""Us too. For plastic surgery on an alligator.""",Dog fight!,2

Phone: No sir it's Google pizza.

M: Oh sorry, wrong number

P: Sir, Google bought Gusto

M: Oh, may I order?

P: Would you like your usual?

M: My usual? You know my usual?

P: According to our caller ID, your last 10 orders were for a large Hawaiian pizza with thin crust

M:Wow! Yes, please!

P: May I suggest you substitute with ricotta, and add arugula and tomato?

M: No thank you, I don't like vegetables

P: But your cholesterol is very high

M: How do you know that?

P: Your default privacy options give us access to the results of your blood tests for the last 7 years

M: Uhm, okay, but I don't want extras on my pizza, I am medicated for the condition

P: Sir, you have not taken the medicine regularly.  Looks like you last purchased a 30 tablet box of your meds 4 months ago from Meds4U dot com

M: I bought more from another supplier

P: It's not showing on your credit card

M: I paid in cash

P: Hmmm, you didn't withdraw that much cash according to your bank statement

M: I have other sources of cash

P: That's not consistent with your 2017 Tax filing, unless you got it from an undeclared income source

M: This is messed? Screw this! I'm going to an Island without any internet, email, phone....

P: Sir, you'll need to renew your passport as it expired 5 weeks ago.
