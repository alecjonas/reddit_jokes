Tom tells Bill… “It smells like shit!”

Tom says to Bill... “It feels like warm wet shit.”

So Bill tells Tom, “You should taste it.”

Tom gets furious and starts cursing at Bill and says there is absolutely no way in hell that he is going to taste the brown spec. 

Bill, being very quick with his words, finally managed to convince Tom to taste it. 

After licking the spec Tom rears back in disgust and starts spitting violently in an attempt to get the taste off of his tongue.

Tom turns to Bill and says, with water welling in his eyes, “That tasted like shit!”

""Andreeeeew...""

First he thinks it´s his own mind playing tricks with him or maybe somehow just the wind but then he hears it again..:

""Andreeeew...""

It sure sounds like.... could it be?.... is this?... Is this my lord, master and savior, Jesus Christ, calling my name from the cross with his maybe last breaths!? 
Still not convinced he starts moving towards Golgatha and few moments later he hears it again, this time slightly louder:

""Andreeeewwwww....""

By now Andrew is convinced and with no more hesitation and disbeliefs he starts running as fast as he can towards his lord. As in a panic state Andrew stumbles several times in his flip flops, falls to the ground, gets up again paying no attention to his bruises. He collide with several pedestrians and animals but he does not stop for anything.
As Andrew gets closer and closer to Golgatha the cry gets louder and louder:

""Andreeeeeeeewwwwwww!""

After what felt like a marathon in distance and time Andrew finally reach the top of Golgatha and throws himself in the dust by Jesus´s cross. After a few moments catching his breath he looks up at Jesus and yells:

""MY LORD, MY SAVIOR! I am here!"" Still breathing heavily Andrew just need an extra moment before he continues.
""Please tell me why you summoned me in this moment of pain and agony? I will do anything you demand of me, tell me what to do and I will do you bitting!""
With tears in his eyes Andrew, still on his knees and hands folded, keeps looking at Jesus waiting for his bitting.

A husband had to leave his wife for 3 months while he attended business in Africa. To prevent her loneliness and to lower the temptations of her being unfaithful he went to the local sex shop and asked the lady at the counter what the best product she had to offer was. The woman pointed at the $400 sex doll in the corner and asked the man, ""Will that do?"" Not wanting his wife to think of the sex doll as another man, the husband shook his head and asked for another suggestion. The counter clerk pointed at the back wall where a rack of dragon dildos hung, to which the man replied that he had plenty of those at home and was looking for something a little more special. 

Looking partially defeated, the counter clerk put her hand to her forehead and thought for a while before removing her hand and saying, ""We have one other option but I really wanted it for myself. It's one of a kind."" The man, intrigued, says ""Let me see it."" The clerk pulls out a antiquated box inlaid with gems along its side. She opens it and pulls out a rather normal looking dildo and turns to the man, who is obviously disappointed. The clerk sees this and announces, ""This is not just any old dildo. It's a magic dildo. It will fill your wife with pleasure once she says the words, 'Magic Dildo,' followed by whatever she hole she desires to put it in. The magic dildo will then fly up straight into her, filling her with an orgasm like she's never had before. She'll be plenty busy with it."" The husband looks skeptical, so the clerk decides to display the dildo's powers for him. Holding the dildo in her hand, she confidently states ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" Upon which the dildo soars from her palm to her vagina, making her immediately open her mouth wide in pants and intensity. After about ten minutes of this, she seems satisfied and says, ""Magic dildo, the box."" Making the dildo fly back to a rest. Impressed, the man rushes home to give the dildo to his wife. 

A week after her husband left the wife decided to give the magic dildo a try. She left it in the garage and then went up into her bed and said, ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" Instantly it appeared where it was called and satisfied the wife. The wife was very excited about her magic dildo and started to use it every where. She called to it at work when no one was looking, in the wooded part of the park, at the movie theater, when she was dancing, everywhere. No matter where she was it would appear and make her squirm with pleasure.

One day on her way to work the wife hit bad traffic. She looked up ahead and saw there was an accident and realized it would be a while and decided to call the magic dildo. The wife was feeling really confident and called out ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" She became overwhelmed and hit the accelerator slamming into the car in front of her. As it turned out that car was a cop.

The cop came up to the car seeing the woman squirming and suspected she was on drugs.

""Get out of the car now and put your hands on the hood!"" The wife tried to comply but ended up just falling to the pavement. The officer was quite alright and asked the wife what she was on. The wife told him ""Officer I'm not on any drugs, my husband gave me a magic dildo and its causing me to lose control!""

The officer, not buying it, simply replied ""Magic dildo, my ass.""",Magic Dildo,287

post,74jy77,2qh72,jokes,false,1507247328,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/74jy77/the_pink_ping_pong_ball/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died. ",The pink ping pong ball,5

The ticket agent looks at the man and then at the duck, which is on a leash.  The ticket agent states that the duck is not permitted in the theatre.  The man explains that the duck is his service pet.   However, because he didn’t have his service pet certification on him, the duck wasn’t allowed in.  

The man then goes to the side of the theatre and stuffs the duck down the front of his pants.  With no duck to be seen, the ticket agent allows the man in.  The theatre was packed and the man ends up sitting next to two old ladies.

About twenty minutes into the movie the duck was getting uncomfortable and hot so the man unzips his pants to let the duck breath.   The duck sticks out his head and starts looking around.  One old lady nudges the other lady and exclaims, “Hey, this guy next to me just unzipped his pants.”  The lady furthest away says, “Once you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all”.  The other lady replies, “Yes, that’s what I thought, but this one’s eating my popcorn”.

MAN - ""Yes.""

WOMAN - ""I've been shopping around and found a beautiful leather coat, and it only costs $2000. Can I get it?""

WOMAN - ""$90,000""

MAN - ""Sure, get it, but for that price, I want all options.""

WOMAN - ""Great, and one last thing.""

MAN - ""What is it?""

WOMAN - ""I was talking to Sarah a couple hours ago, and the house I really wanted to get two years ago is back on the market now.""

post,749oow,2qh72,jokes,false,1507138012,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/749oow/zoltan/,self.jokes,,"In a kingdom far far away there lived a king named Abet who was known for his cruelty towards prisoners. He played with his prisoners to humiliate them and give them painful punishments. He was smart and creative when it came to these punishments and he loved it like a sport.

One day two prisoners were brought to the King. The first culprit had sneaked into the kingdom without proper papers and the second was caught talking shit about the king. The king was furious but as any other time he had glorious and painful plans for them.

The king asked the first prisoner, ""I have two punishments for you to choose from. Choose wisely. If you choose the first punishment you will be fucked by Zoltan, my guard. And if you choose the second punishment, you will be killed. Which punishment do you choose?""

The prisoner was shocked at the offer. But after thinking about it for a very long time he decided to be fucked by Zoltan. After all, despite the stain, he would still be alive. ""I choose option one, my King!""
""As you please! Zoltan fuck this man!""

But then Zoltan came forward. A man as large as a giant, with his cock bigger than a normal hand. Fear swept across the room. The prisoner's soul left his body. Zoltan started to fuck him so hard that the terror of this scene shook everybody in the room. It was absolutely gruesome. When Zoltan was done with the prisoner it was clear that this would haunt this prisoner for the rest of his life.

When this ended, the king turned to the second prisoner and gave him the same two choices. ""Choose wisely!"", he said.
The prisoner had seen enough. No crime was worth getting fucked by this monster. He'd rather die. ""I choose the second option, my King! I want to die!""

The king smiled and said ""ZOLTAN! Fuck this man to death!""",Zoltan!,2

post,749end,2qh72,jokes,false,1507135541,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/749end/pillsbury_doughboy/,self.jokes,,"So, the Pillsbury Doughboy was walking down the street one day minding his own business when Woody from Toystory happens upon him. The two recognize each other and say hello, and have a little chat. As the pair were saying their good byes, Woody asks ""Can I poke your belly."" Doughboy says ""I would rather you didn't because I really don't like it, in fact I hate it when people do, but since you asked nicely you may."" So Woody goes ahead and pokes him and without fail he laughs as he always does in the commercials. Woody thanks him for his time and they part ways. A little further down the road the Doughboy sees Buzz Lightyear walking his way. The Doughboy says ""Oh hello, I just met your friend Woody."" Buzz says ""Oh great im meeting up with him for lunch."" As Buzz was saying this he walks up to the  Doughboy and just pokes his tummy. The Doughboy involuntarily laughs then says ""I really dont appreciate that, I dont like people touching my stomache to begin with let alone without asking first."" Buzz tells him ""Its no big deal I only poked you."" The doughboy says ""It may be no big deal to you but you aren't the one getting poked and proded by every Tom, Dick, and Harry that recognizises you day in and day out."" Buzz apologizes saying ""I didn't realize it was such a problem for you. I wont do it again."" The doughboy says ""I appreciate that."" Buzz realizes he is running late for lunch and apologizes again and hurries off after woody. The Doughboy slightly miffed continues walking down the road. Then he sees a herd of the little green aliens. Without saying a word to him they walk towards him in a line and one after another start poking his tummy. Naturally this is very upsetting to the Doughboy, but he can't move because the near endless stream of aliens poking him and causing him to laugh without his consent is preventing him from getting away. After about 20 pokes the Doughboy is getting very angry, and he sees the commotion is drawing in even more of the little green bastards joining the line just as it was almost finished. More and more aliens join the line as they notice whats going on, and the poor Doughboy is just getting angrier and angrier. After nearly two hours of this hell it is almost over, the line is nearly empty, and the doughboy is nearly blind with rage. As the last alien has his poke and the Doughboy lets out his last laugh the massive group of aliens collectively breath in and simultaneously go ""ooooooooooooooooooo."" Then the Doughboy snaps and says ""Now it is my turn to poke you."" As he balls up his fist and runs it through the stomache of the nearest alien. He goes on a rampage of destruction against them. Smashing their heads and crushing their bodies as he screams ""Where is your precious claw now. I decide who will live and who will die."" At this moment Woody and Buzz are walking back from lunch, and they see the carnage all around the Doughboy, who is still in his rampage. Woody can't believe his eyes and decides to call in the Army Men. Woody explains to them what is going on, and it doesnt take the Army men long to arrive. As soon as they get there they begin their attack on the Doughboy. One squad sneaks behind him with a cookie sheet while the others start to tie him up with ropes. The Army Men get a good hold on the beast as the cookie sheet gets setup behind him. Two brave soldier hold a rope behind him as a trip wire while the rest pull him down onto the sheet. Once they fell the Doughboy they tied him down to the sheet like Gulliver. Woody felt some remorse knowing what had to be done to the poor creature still fighting his bonds. As a single tear rolls down Woody's cheek he says ""Bake him away toys."" ",Pillsbury Doughboy,5

 The boss told Joe that he was to be in charge of the foundry operations while Ling was to arrange for the extra Supplies but he told the men who would be back in the afternoon to check on them and he expected them to deliver. Both gentlemen  agreed  and went off to do their respective tasks.

Joe sensed that this was his opportunity to outperform Ling and show that he could be looked at for the upcoming promotion. So Joe worked tirelessly to ensure that there was no problems with operations of the foundry. But  he then noticed that the supplies were getting low and that the extra shipments had not arrived yet. He then realized that the boss would arrive soon and he could be in trouble so he went to look for Ling.

Joe went to to check Ling's office but Ling was not there. Joe asked around the office but nobody had seen Ling. Joe stood there confused, and to make matters worse the boss had just arrived. Joe rushed to explain the situation when Ling suddenly  jumped out of hiding onto both men shouting....... 'SUPLISE !'",Hard workers,2
