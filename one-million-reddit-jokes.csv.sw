 They had been going at it for days, and frankly God's was tired of hearing all the bickering.

Finally fed up, God said, 'THAT'S IT! I have had enough. I am going to set set up a test that will run for two hours, and from those results, I will will judge who does the better job.'

So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away.

They moused.

They faxed.

They e-mailed.

They e-mailed with attachments.

They downloaded.

They did spreadsheets!

They wrote reports.

They created labels and cards.

They created charts and graphs.

They did some genealogy reports

They did every job known to man.

Jesus worked with heavenly efficiency and Satan was faster than hell.

Then, ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, rain poured, and, of course, the powerwent off 

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word knownin the underworld.

Jesus just sighed.

Finally the electricity came back on, and each of them restarted their computers. 

Satan started searching frantically, screaming:'It's gone! It's all GONE! 'I lost everything when the power wentout!'

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours of work.

Satan observed this and became irate.'Wait!' he screamed. 'That's not fair! He cheated! How come he has all his His work and I don't have any?'

God just shrugged and said,Jesus SAVES",Jesus vs Satan,63

Arabian: ""hello my friend, are you selling your camel?"" 

Seller: ""yes i am""

Arabian: ""how much is the camel?"" 

Seller: ""just 100 coins""

Feeling something is wrong, the Arabian man asked the seller why the camel is very cheap 

Seller: ""there is nothing wrong with my camel and it can run really fast""

Arabian: ""really?"" 

Seller: ""yes, to make it run just say 'alhamdullilah and to make it stop just say 'astaghfirullah' ""

Soon the Arabian handed the seller 100 coins and rode the camel. While running through the sands he kept making the camel go faster yelling ""alhamdullilah! alhamdullilah!"" and the camel kept running faster. Suddenly the Arabian man noticed that the camel is running towards a cliff. The Arabian man started panicking as jumping off the camel would wound him badly but if he stayed on the camel he would plunge to his death. When the camel was already running to the edge of the cliff the Arabian man remembered the command to make the camel stopped and yelled ""astaghfirullah!"" and the camel stopped right at the edge of the cliff. The Arabian man wiped his sweat of his forehead and put one hand on his chest and said #""alhamdullilah""",A man and a camel,0

I sensed her discomfort and tried to tell her to just give me two quarters, but she hailed the manager for help. While he tried to explain the transaction to her, she stood there and cried... 
 
Why do I tell you this? Because of the evolution in teaching math since the 1960s: 


1) Teaching Math In 1960s 

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit ? 


2)Teaching Math In 1970s 

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit? 


3) Teaching Math In 1980s 
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80. Did he make a profit ?  Yes or No


4)Teaching Math In 1990s 

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20. Your assignment: Underline the number 20. 


5) Teaching Math In 2000s 

A logger cuts down a beautiful forest because he is selfish and inconsiderate and cares nothing for the habitat of animals or the preservation of our woodlands. He does this so he can make a profit of $20. What do you think of this way of making a living? Topic for class participation after answering the question: How did the birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down their homes? (There are no wrong answers, and if you feel like crying, it's ok). 


6)Teaching Math In 2010 

Un hachero vende una carretada de maderapara $100. El costo de la producciones es $80. Cuanto dinero ha hecho? 

ANSWER: His profit was $375,000 because his logging business is just a front for his pot farm.

One day Little Billy is sitting outside of his house, on the curb.
He is holding a cat under one arm, and has a bag of M&amp;Ms in the other hand.

Across the street, Mr. Johnson is busy mowing his lawn.

Mr. Johnson looks over, and sees Little Billy and waves to him. Little Billy sees Mr. Johnson wave and waves back to him. A moment after that, Little Billy pops a M&amp;M in his mouth, takes a bite out of the cat's butt and scoots down the curb.

Mr. Johnson says to himself...""Did I just see what I think I did? That kids always been weird anyways..."" And continues on mowing.

A few moments go by and Mr. Johnson glances over to check on Little Billy, and within a second there goes Little Billy, poppin' a M&amp;M in his mouth, taking a bite out of the cat's butt and scooting down the curb.

""What in the HELL is wrong with that kid!! I know what I saw this time!"" Mr. Johnson says to himself, and then decides once he's done, he'd gonna talk to Little Billy.

So a few more moments go by and Mr. Johnson finishes up mowing and puts away his mower. He begins to walk over to Little Billy, who is still on the curb...and then he pops another M&amp;M, takes a bite out of the cat's butt and scoots down the curb.

""Hi there Billy, how are you today?""

""I'm good Mr. Johnson, how are you?!""

""I'm doing well Billy, thank you.""

Mr. Johnson looks over at Little Billy, he is still holding the cat under his arm and his bag of M&amp;Ms.

""Say, Billy, what are you doing out here on the curb with a cat and M&amp;Ms?""

""I'm playing!""

Next week comes and he also doesn't show. People are becoming alarmed but since no one had his contact information there was nothing they could do.

""Just a Sprite"", he responds.

Everyone is shocked. This guy would get shitfaced every weekend, he could drink more than anyone who had ever been to the bar.

""But you usually start off with a bit of vodka, what's the matter?"", demanded the bartender.

Irish man replies, ""Well you see, last time I was here I drank so much I don't even remember how much I drank. What I do remember is that once I got home I blew chunks all over the driveway. Then I stumbled in my living room and blew chunks on the carpet. I dragged myself to the restroom and I blew chucks in the tub. I finally made it to my bedroom and I blew chunks until I fell asleep.

I am writing to say what an excellent product you have!
One evening about a month ago, while at home, I spilled some red wine on my new white shirt. My wife started to berate me about my clumsiness and how expensive the shirt was. That I was stupid, couldn't even hold a glass right, and so on...

Well, one thing led to another and I ended up with a lot of her blood on my white shirt as well.


I tried to get the stains out using the bargain brand detergent my wife bought, but they just wouldn't come out. I went to the local convenience store and got a bottle of Liquid Tide with bleach alternative and all of the stains came out! They came out so well in fact, that the forensic tests were all negative!

I thank you once again for a great product!

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full.

 Starving, dirty, smelled terrible, skinny, and hair all matted down.. We felt sorry for her so we put her in a carrier and took her to the vet. 

 We didn't know what to call her so we named her 'Pussycat.' 

 The vet decided to keep her for a day or so 

 He said he would let us know when we could come and get her. 



 My husband (the complainer) said, 'OK, but don't forget to wash her, she stinks.' 



 He reminded the vet that it was his WIFE (me) that wanted the dirty cat, not him. 



 My husband and my Vet don't see eye to eye. 

 The vet calls my husband 'El-Cheap-O', and my husband calls the vet 'El-Charge-O'. 





 They love to hate each other and constantly 'snipe' at one another, 

 With my husband getting in the last word on this particular occasion.. 



 The next day my husband had an appointment with his doctor, 

 Who is located in the same building, next door to the vet. 



 The GP's waiting room and office was full of people waiting to see the doctor. 

 A side door opened and the vet leaned in - he had obviously seen my husband arrive. 



 He looked straight at my husband and in a loud voice said, 'Your wife's pussy doesn't stink any more. 

 We washed and shaved it, and now she smells like a rose! 

 Oh, and, by the way, she's pregnant! 

 God only knows who the father is!'

The experience is okay. He mostly sits around on the clouds singing and playing the harp, and exchanging some pleasant conversation with the angels. He goes back to Peter the next day, and is sent to hell this time.

The elevator arrives at the bottom, and the doors open. He is in a beautiful garden, it's sunny, and there is a nearby golf course. A bar in the pristine looking garden keeps the drinks flowing: beer, cocktails, wine, whiskey, whatever the heart could imagine. There is also a buffet. All his friends and family that have passed away are there, and they greet him cheerfully. Even Satan is there, and he ends up being a really nice and cool guy who assists the politician in whatever he can. After chatting with them for awhile, the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen comes to him, and they end up having the best sex he has ever experienced. 

At the end of the day, the politician goes back to St. Peter. ""I hope you enjoyed the tryouts sir. What do you choose, heaven or hell?"" The politician replies ""well Peter to be honest heaven is great and all, but I really enjoyed hell a lot more. I'd like to go there."" 

His wish is granted. When the elevator doors open in hell, he is greeted by horror. The whole place is dark and gloomy, his friends are screaming as they are burning in pits of fire, and demons walk around beating with pitch forks those who try to escape the flames. 

The politician walks up to Satan and demands an explanation. ""Yesterday it was so nice! A garden, golf, beautiful women, free food and drinks. Yet today you are torturing my friends. What the heck man?"" The devil (no longer friendly and cool as he was the day before) smiles slyly. ""Sorry for the mixup.

“Of course, madam,” he muttered through clenched teeth, squeezed into the window, and began the painstaking task of taking the dummy apart to remove the gown. Eventually he succeeded and was able to hand it over to the demanding customer.
“How do I look?” she asked, emerging from the dressing room. “Does it show off my marvelous breasts to advantage?”

post,4pfd89,2qh72,jokes,false,1466663682,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4pfd89/nate_the_snake/,self.jokes,,"There’s this civil engineer who has a dream of a super-interstate-highway running from Los Angeles to Washington DC. After years of lobbying, he finally is awarded a contract to construct a perfectly-flat, perfectly-straight 16-lanes-each-direction highway from Los Angeles to Washington. So he employs all the best surveyors, to make sure the highway is a perfect straight-line from LA to DC and to make sure it stays perfectly flat. He subcontracts with only the best construction crews and uses only the best materials. He decides the existing tunnel-diggers and mountain removers just aren’t up to the job, so he has bigger ones built, ones that can remove a half-mile swath of the Rockies in a week. They start in LA, and a few months later, they’re overlooking the greater Washington metropolis.
Just one more hill to remove before they start work on the terminus and the merging into DC’s outer belts. It’s a small hill, really, but it’s got to go. So they call in one of the smaller mountain-removers to remove it, and just as the machine’s getting ready to erase the hill, a snake pops up out of the hill and screams “Wait!”
Obviously, this catches everyone by surprise, so they wait. The snake continues, “My name’s Nate. Nate the Snake. You can’t destroy this hill! You mustn’t!”
“Why not?”
“Because there’s a lever buried under this hill, and it’s attached to a doomsday device. If the lever is tripped, it’ll blow up the entire Earth!”
The engineer consults with his team. “What do you think?” “It’s a talking snake.” “Yeah, but do we believe him? Do we go around the hill, or do we plow it over?” “Do we believe him!? It’s a talking snake! Who’d believe us?” In the end, they decide to err on the side of caution and build the highway around the hill. So, when they’re finished, they’ve got a highway running from LA to DC that’s perfectly-flat and perfectly-straight, except for this minor detour around a hill.
So they’ve got the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and as a perk for designing and building the highway, the engineer gets to be the very first person to use it. So he hops into his Lamborghini in LA at dawn and floors the pedal. 30, 40, 50mph. Shifts into 2nd gear. 70, 90, 110mph. He keeps accelerating until the car just can’t go any faster.
Shortly before sunset, he’s approaching DC, and he remembers the hill. So he slows down to around 225mph to negotiate the slight turn. And he sees Nate crossing the road! He can’t squish a talking snake! Especially one that kept them from blowing up the Earth. So he swerves to avoid hitting Nate, and plows into the hill at over 200mph. He trips the lever, and the Earth blows up.
The moral of the story…
Better Nate than lever.

St. Peter continues to show him different neighborhoods all afternoon and they are all in the same perfect condition, each one just as nice as the last.

The guy goes, “they are all great, I can’t decide”

St. Peter says “one last neighborhood to show.”  They end up at a huge wall, as tall as the eye can see.  St. Peter and the guy climb and climb and finally reach the top and peer over.  It’s the same thing as before; awesome idyllic neighborhood, kids laughing and playing, people enjoying each other’s company etc…

post,4peb68,2qh72,jokes,false,1466646482,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4peb68/the_hunchbacks_apprentice/,self.jokes,,"Quasimodo the hunchback was getting somewhat long in the tooth, and his lack of vigour was starting to show. The enthusiasm wasn't there, no cheerful smile or impish oafishness characterised his stagger, and the hint of gleefulness from his glory days had long passed with the tide of the years.

The cardinal of Notre Damn, increasingly aware of the lacklustre in the sounds peeling from the bell tower, one day decided to ascend the steps to speak with the hunchback.

""Quasi, mate, you've done a Stirling job for Paris and its people over the years. You're ridgy-didge in my books, but ya know, some of the other priests have noticed that the ol *joi de vivre* just doesn't seem to be there for you anymore. Have you ever thought of training up a young apprentice to take over the bell ringing gig?

Quasi looks up through his mangy locks to meet the cardinals eyes, first in anger, but then in resignation. He stares off into the distance, far across the reaches of the city skyline and mumbles quietly ""You know, I've never really considered it. This place has been my home and my family for so long, I've never wanted anything else. But maybe you're right. Maybe it's time to find something more, something different.... Give me a few days to mull it over.""

After a long period of soul-searching and self-reflection, Quasi finally agrees to the cardinals idea and heads down out of his tower and once again into the bustling markets of *les enfants rouge* where he comes across a cheerful young man, shining shoes for pennies.

Quasi approaches the young man, raising his hood ever so slightly to reveal the prominence of his enormous brow, and with a twinkle in his eye, he says ""Hey kid, want a real job?"". The young man, instantly awestruck by the presence of the legend jumps to his feet and says ""it's, it's you... it's really you!""

""Shhhh!!"" says Quasi, ""what I'm offering you is something only that only the most dedicated, the most fearless, and the most selfless of souls would dare accept.""

""Are you interested?""
""Of course!""
""Then follow me""

A short while later, the two men stand atop the south tower in the full brunt of a cold and windy Parisian winters' day. The young man shivers in the cold, the older man looks intently into his eyes.

""This is where the magic happens kid"" he says, spreading his deformed arm expansively across the vista before their eyes. ""The only real challenge to the job is actually getting ol Emmanuel to sing. You see, unlike the other bells, this grand bell lost its clapper years ago and the cardinal has been pretty skimp on the upkeep of these towers. Over the last few years, I've mastered my own technique. So pay attention boy, and watch how it's done.""

The hunchback throws off his heavy cloak, revealing his aged and gnarled musculature, and with the wind whipping at his grey beard he roots each of his enormous arms to the lip of the bell, drawing it back with all his might and flinging it forward and up into the air. He releases and with the enormous bell waving slowly, silently, menacingly, back and forth, he turns back to the young man and growls ""Strength, courage and bravery. If you hesitate you will get hurt"". 

He waits and watches the bell, and at the apogee, he sets his stance, raises his shoulders to his neck, grits his teeth, and leans in as the mass of metal rushes at his head.

A deep and resonant peel rings out as the crown of his forehead connects with the strike point, stopping the bell almost dead in its trajectory, save for a few inches of controlled sliding underfoot from the hunchback.

""Your turn kid""

Quasi draws the young man close and says ""I'll get it swinging, just concentrate on what I said. Courage, Strength, Bravey"" He's sets the bell into a gentle spin and let's the young man set himself for the challenge.

The young man leaps into face the bell, but at the last instant, he is overcome with terror and attempts to avert his face by flinching back, only to have the lip crash hard into his mandible, fracturing his jaw instantly and dislodging several teeth in the process. The bell lets out a muffled peel. The young man collapses to the floor, clutching his face.

""No, no, no!!"" yells Quasi ""You lost your nerve! You can never flinch. If you have to back out, then for god's sake duck! Don't flinch back!""

The young man slowly rises to his feet, clearly severely injured, but determined. Quasi raises one eyebrow and says ""Again?"" The boy nods.

Once more, the old man sets the bell in motion. Once more, the young man sets himself. Once more he flinches. This time raising his nose to meet the lip of the giant bell.

Crunch!

Once more, blood erupts from his face, and once more the young man crumples to the floor to the whimper of a soft peel of response from the bell.

Quasi looks at the young man and grumbles to himself ""I should have never agreed to this. Young kids these days... They don't listen and they've got no bloody resilience""

""Look kid, just forget it. Go home, go back to shining shoes for pennies. I will find someone else who actually has real courage, real strength and real bravery.""

Incensed, as Quasi had hoped, the young man staggers to his feet once more, and with a mangled primal scream into the harsh winter's wind, he grabs the bell, and fuelled with adrenaline and rage, casts it with near Herculean strength high up into the sky. 

But rather than taking time to set himself, this time her reacts instantly and instinctually. He haunches his shoulders and aims his crown directly at the lip on the very first return of the bell. He makes perfect contact!

The bell peels deeply, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the change in momentum of the impact in against an unset stance sends the young man flying backwards through the air, straight out of the bell tower and down onto the cobbled streets below where he lands with a solid thud.

""Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!!"" mutters Quasi repeatedly as he hobbles down the steps to the tower as quickly as possible and out onto the street where a crowd have gathered.

A passer by is at the young mans side, cradling his lifeless head in his hands he looks up to the crowd and says ""Does anyone know this young mans name?!""

Quasi looks down and says ""Shit, you know I never did get his name, but his face rings a bell.""

They searched the entire island for food and drinkable water the whole day, to no avail. The following day, right when they were about to lose all hope of survival, they came across a basin made of a strange material. It was big enough for a grown man to fit in it, and so Fred decided to stand in it to inspect it better.

""Well, what's it made of?"" asked Jeff.

""I don't know, man, but I sure wish we had some water to drink,"" replied Fred, exhausted.

All of a sudden, the whole basin was filled with the clearest and cleanest water. The three guys were astonished to see the basin magically fill with water, but their thirst got the better of them and they filled their canisters without a second thought.

After quenching their thirst and filling their canisters to the brim with the life-saving water, Jeff asked Fred to switch places with him. He wanted to try something.

Jeff stood in the seemingly magic basin, and after thinking for a while, he says ""fruits."" And just like that, the basin is filled with an assortment of the tastiest-looking fruits the three of them had ever seen. They collected the fruits and stuffed their pockets with all the fruits they could fit. There were too many for them to carry that a few of the fruits fell on the ground while Jeff was getting out of the basin.

""My turn, my turn!"" exclaimed Todd, excited to try out the magic basin and to ask for something nice they could eat with the fruits. He rushed towards the basin and slipped on one of the bananas that had fallen on the ground earlier. He fell into the basin and shouted, ""OH SHIT!""

He is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

He forced himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose!!

He sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all cleaned and pressed! He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house.

He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: 'Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian'

He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper.

His 16 year old son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, 'Son.what happened last night?'

'Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind you fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.'
Confused, he asked his son, 'So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??'

His son replies, 'Oh THAT... Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!!'",Jack wakes up with a huge hangover...,2271

Miss Beatrice, the church organist, was in her eighties and had never been married. She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.

One afternoon the pastor came to call on her, and she showed him into her quaint sitting room. She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea.

As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut glass bowl sitting on top of it. The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom!                                  

When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat. The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and he could no longer resist.                               

'Miss Beatrice', he said, 'I wonder if you would tell me about this (pointing to the bowl).'                    

'Oh, yes,' she replied. 'Isn't it wonderful? I was walking through the park a few months ago, and I found this little package on the ground. The directions said to place it on the organ and keep it wet and that it would prevent the spread of disease.

And finally they got married, and had a little sweet Potato, which they Called 'Yam.'

Of course, they wanted the best for Yam.
When it was time, they told her about the facts of life.

They warned her about going out and getting half-baked,
so she wouldn't get accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like 'Hot Potato,' and end up with a bunch of Tater Tots

Yam said not to worry, no Spud would get
her into the sack and make a rotten potato out of her!


But on the other hand she wouldn't stay home and become
a couch potato either.

She would get plenty of exercise so as not to be skinny like
her shoestring cousins.

When she went off to Europe, Mr. And Mrs. Potato told Yam
to watch out for the hard-boiled guys from Ireland .

And the greasy guys from France called the French Fries. And
when she went out west, to watch out for the Indians so she
wouldn't get scalloped..

Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and
wouldn't associate with those high class Yukon Golds,
or the ones from the other side of the tracks who advertise their trade on on all the trucks that say, 'Frito Lay.'

Mr. And Mrs. Potato sent Yam to Idaho P.U. (that's Potato University )
so that when she graduated she'd really be in the Chips.
But in spite of all they did for her, one-day Yam came home
and announced she was going to marry Peter Mansbridge.

Peter Mansbridge!
Mr. and Mrs. Potato were very upset.


They told Yam she couldn't possibly marry
Peter Mansbridge

So back in the 30's or sometime there was this guy who desperately wanted to be a train conductor.  It all started in his early childhood.  Ya see, he was orphaned from a very young age, but he still had very vivid memories of his parents.  Now, his parents were horrible people, they abused him, and most of all scoffed at his aspirations of becoming a train conductor.  He had run away and took up residence in the local orphanage.  There all he dreamed of was being a REAL train conductor.  He told all the staff, and they all supported his dreams.  Several years pass and one day the owner of the orphanage came up to him and says:
""I am friends with the conductor at the train station, he's an old man like me and he's going to be retiring soon.  He wanted to finish out this year, but he has offered you the position of ticket collector, so you can see how he runs the show.  Once he retires you would be the new train conductor.""

Now at this point our guy is elated.  His dreams are coming true!  He agrees to take the ticket collector position and will start the following morning.  He wakes up at the crack of dawn and sets off for the train station.  Everything was going well, he collects tickets flawlessly for about 3 or 4 months.  During the middle of his shift, he notices a woman that has a striking resemblance to his mother.  His mother was not in the same ballpark as anyone who is considered attractive, and he assumes it's her immediately.  His heart starts racing, and he walks straight up to her.  He takes his ticket puncher and begins to beat her with it.  Now I'm not going to go into the gory details about how he's using this ticket puncher, but just know it is gruesome.  There's blood everywhere, small circular patches of skin all over the floor and the seats.  The passengers are mortified.  He kills this woman, and the police arrest him, he pleads guilty, is sentenced to death, and is taken to prison.  

He is scheduled to be executed in a week, and like any man would, is dreading it.  He thinks about how he would have done things differently, and maybe controlled his emotions if he was put in this scenario again.  The night before his execution is a really stormy night, and his spirits are as low as ever.  The jail guard senses that he's down and thinks he can cheer him up a bit with his last meal.  A slight smile appears across his face, and he asks for his favorite, chicken fried steak, with a side of fried okra.  He eats everything on the plate and asks for more.  

The method of execution during this time was the electric chair, and the operators were getting it set up for its next victim.  The execution is going quite normally, or as normally as any execution can go, and our guy sits down in his chair.  They put the hat on his head.  Strap him down.  Ask for any last words.  Then begin to electrocute him.  This execution is more spectacular than any other execution these men have ever seen before.  There's smoke, violent thrashing, and worst of all screaming.  After a minute or so they cut the power.

He's sitting in the chair very motionless.  They begin to unstrap him and much to their surprise he sits up!  Now his punishment was to be electrocuted by the electric chair, and he was in fact electrocuted in the electric chair.  They can't punish the poor man again, so they release him hoping he's learned his lesson.

He picks up his job collecting tickets again and is told if he does anything wrong again, he's out of there.  Once again several months pass, and as he is collecting tickets, he runs into a man who is reminiscent of his father.  His mother was bad, but to him his father was worse.  He doesn't even have the composure to walk over to him.  He breaks out into a sprint down 3 train cars.  He tackles the man and once again murders him (much more brutally than the last one).  The same thing happens that happened to him last time.  He is sent to court.  Sentenced to death by the electric chair, and sent to prison.  He asks for a last meal, which he is denied, and is sitting in the electric chair the next day.

This time the operators aren't fucking around.  They douse this guy in water.  Turn up the power to levels that are high enough to kill an elephant.  They turn it on, and just as last time there is a shitload of thrashing, screaming smoke, and the smell of burning hair and flesh.  They leave that sucker on for muccchhh too long for anyone to possibly survive it.  They cut the power, and check to see if the man still lives.  Much to their dismay he, although burned, hairless, and in a world of hurt, sits up.  The lead operator loses his mind and gets in his face.  

""HOW!  How are you still alive!? I understand that the first time it may have been a freak accident, but this time we were going to make SURE you were dead.""  

Our guy looks him straight in the eyes, and with a quiet, raspy voice, he says ""I guess I'm just not a very good conductor"".

  
Now I'm kinda new here and I don't know if this joke has been here before.  Thanks for reading it and I hope someone out there liked it.  c:

An elderly old gentlemen sat down across from Little Johnny and was enjoying the bright sunny day, when he noticed Little Johnny, wiggling and squirming and doing mighty strange things on the opposite bench.

Little Johnny would pop an M&amp;M into the air, catch it in his mouth, pick up his kitty cat and take a bite of it, then scoot his little butt along the park bench.

The elderly old gent, couldn't quite understand what the little boy was doing, so called over to the youngster and said, ""Son, what are you doing?""

As Little Johnny threw another M&amp;M in the air, took a bite out of his kitty cat and scooted further down the bench, he said to the elderly gentlemen, ""I am playing truck driver.""

""Truck driver, you don't say,"" the old gent said, wondering where this youngster got his imagination. Little 
Johnny continued to throw an M&amp;M in the air, catch it in his mouth, take a nip out of the squirming kitty cat, and then scooted further along the park bench.

Finally after watching this activity for quite some time, the old gent, who just couldn't figure out how that was playing truck driver, called over to Little Johnny and said, ""Son, I don't understand how you're playing truck driver, could you explain the game to me?""

Little Johnny, a polite youngster, said ""Certainly sir, first I pop some pills (he throws an M&amp;M in the air and catches it in his mouth), then I eat some pussy (takes a bite out of the kitty cat), then I move on down the road, (he scoots along the park bench).",Playing truck driver,0

Unknown to him, his brother John's wife had died suddenly in his absence.

When he got back on shore he went into town to pick up a few things at the grocery store. A kind old woman there mistook him for John and said, ""I'm so sorry for your loss. You must feel terrible.""

Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat said, ""Hell no! Fact is, I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish. She had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too.

The current rooster was still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in years. And the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt anything. So he bought a young rooster from the local rooster emporium, and turned him loose in the barnyard. 

The old rooster saw the young one strutting around and felt a little worried, knowing full well the fate that awaited old birds like him. ""So, they're trying to replace me,"" thought the old rooster. ""I've got to do something about this."" 

He walked up to the new bird and said, ""So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff, don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself."" 

The young rooster was of a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. ""You're on,"" said the young rooster. ""And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy!"" 

So the two roosters went over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering around to watch. The race begun and all the hens started cheering the roosters on. 

After the first lap, the old rooster was still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead had slipped a little but he was still hanging in there. Unfortunately the old rooster's lead continued to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he was just barely in front of the young rooster. 

By now the farmer heard all the commotion. He ran into the house, took his shotgun, and ran out to the barnyard figuring a fox or something was after his chickens. When he got there, he saw the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately took his shotgun, aimed, fired, and blew the young rooster away.

As he walked away slowly, the farmer thought to himself, ""Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month!""",A Tale of Two Roosters,200

Unfortunately his car broke down as he was making his way through the sticks. He couldn't afford to miss the meeting, so he made his way on foot. The businessman then came upon a farm with a host of animals. He met a rancher who greeted him, saying that they didn't get many visitors. 

The businessman told the rancher his struggle. The rancher feeling generous decides to help the businessman's plight and offers him one of his horses. The businessman hesitated at first, as he never had any experience riding horses, but took the offer anyway.

As he was saddled, the rancher began to explain how to ride the horse. "" This horse here is a peculiar one. In order to make her go, you must say Thank God. In order to get her to stop, you have to say, Hallelujah."" The businessman nodded, and then thanked the rancher. The businessman stared puzzingly at the horse. "" Th-thank...God?"" He muttered. As soon as he spat out the phrase, the horse sped off at a breakneck pace.

About an hour later, the businessman was making great progress. As the horse galloped, he peered toward the distance and saw a cliff side on the horizon. The businessman panicked, urging the horse to slow down, but the horse sped forward without hesitation. The businessman thought of jumping off the horse, but at the speed she was going, theres no way he'd come out unscathed. The businessman thought long and hard, trying to remember what the rancher said about stopping the horse. As he pondered, the horse moved ever so closer to the edge of the cliff. The businessman racked his brain...and then...

""Hallelujah!"" The businessman screeched. The horse stopped dead in it's tracks, just inches from the edge of the cliffside. The businessman breathed a sigh of relief, wiping sweat from his forehead. 

"" Thank God.""
