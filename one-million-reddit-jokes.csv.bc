Driving along for a while when Jim spots a broken down Car on the side of the road, apparently having some issues. As Jim is passing he realizes the Car is a Old Fiat 500. 

Chuckling to Himself about the State of the Car Jim decides to pull over and lend this poor Bloke a hand. After enquiring where the Problem is Jim offers to tow the Guy to the next workshop which the Fiat drivers graciously accepts.
 So after talking things through with the Driver, Jim suggests the other guy get into his Fiat.  Before starting tho they agree that in case Jim is speeding the Driver in the Fiat should honk his horn and flash his lights so Jim would know when things are moving to fast for the Fiat driver. After all the Fiat driver is not used to the neckbreaking Speeds a Ferrari LaFerrari is capable off. 

Once they got back on the 2 Lane Highway Jim was driving on the right line with a moderate Speed as suddenly:""Wroooom!!"". A Bright Yellow Lamborghini blitzes past them while looking straight at Jim and poking fun at him.
Jim, obviously, wasn't having none of that Cocky Shit and hits the Pedal to The Metal as he begins rushing after the Lamborghini Driver.
After a While Jim catches up and the two of them go on to race their cars to the Maximum. Forcing their Cars engines to the absolute Brink as they race each other Head to Head.

They go on like that for a while until they pass a Police Trooper on speed control duty. The Officer witnessing the Race just feints and drops on His back. In Shock his Colleague ran over to check on him. After a bit the Officer regains his Conscience and his Partner asks Him WTF happened?
Officer:"" Dude I've just seen a Ferrari And a Lamborghini speeding. They have booth been doing over 200 M/pH.!!"". ""Well..."" the other Officer sighs.. ""That's still no reason to pass out tho""?

Stevie looks Joey straight in the eyes and says, ""52, Joey. 52.""

Joey sits down quietly and stares into his drink as the crowd applauds.

Stevie thinks for a moment, and then yells, ""Tommy - if you left the bar right now, the average IQ in the room would go up!""

Tommy grins broadly and says in a quiet, firm voice, ""19.""

Stevie freezes, stunned. The crowd goes silent.

Then, all at once, the room breaks into a cacophony of applause, cheers, laughter, and general merriment. Stevie yells over the noise, ""Drinks are on me!""

You’re walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children.
Suddenly, a Terrorist with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges at you…
You are carrying a Kimber 1911 chambered in .45 ACP, and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do?
******************************
Democrat’s Answer:
Well, that’s not enough information to answer the question! What is a Kimber 1911 and what does .45 ACP mean?
Does the man look poor or oppressed? Is he really a terrorist? Am I guilty of profiling? Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?
Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand? What does the law say about this situation?
Does the pistol have an appropriate safety built into it? Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children?
Is it possible he’d be happy with just killing me? Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me?
Should I call 9-1-1? Why is this street so deserted? Can we make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior.
I need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus. This is all so confusing!

After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 80,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 80,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh. Everyone is disheartened, the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 blondes begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance—What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

Throughout the stadium, pandemonium breaks out as all 80,000 blondes jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""","80,000 blondes meet in a football stadium for a ""Blondes Are Not Stupid"" Convention.",130

He got an idea for an insect colony in a park that must prevent other intruders from entering via special codes, but he ran out of good characters and gave up. His next idea was a dangerous knight clad in gold who went rogue and was bashing down a door of a high class man, but the backstory was terribly vague and unclear. Finally, he gave up and tried to write fan fiction instead, getting the idea from Death Note of how the main character might have extended his reach to the capital of Korea. He had become immortal but was sent into a coma thanks to his nemesis’s clever planning. But he couldn’t figure out a way to do this. But at least you could say, because of soup, her smash, bros,

There was such a large range of aliens that the area manager decided naming the aliens would be a necessity, however the aliens only liked one name: ""AL"". Now they couldn't all be called AL and so he began adding a word or two to give the alien an identity. There was a gadget AL, a fire AL, a water AL and even a Cow AL.

The original AL was the being in charge and he'd manage the aliens and appoint them their jobs and recently they'd had a problem they couldn't find an alien that could successfully decide on advanced war decisions, since the extraterrestrials were so much more advanced the government had them decide on such things.

The original AL thought that perhaps their species didn't have what it takes to make those kind of decisions a certain key element that humans have but they don't, but then he remembered a special fellow and he decided to present him to the government as the new decision master.

At the presentation Big AL set up the chairs and Coffee AL set up the drinks and AL took the chosen AL and set him in front of the humans, they asked him ""what does he have that the rest of the extraterrestrials don't?""

When he looked at the sky, he couldn’t tell what the winter was going to be like. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea.

He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, “Is the coming winter going to be cold?”

“It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,” he was responded.

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again, “Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?”

“Yes,” the man at National Weather Service again replied, “it’s going to be a very cold winter.”

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. “Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?”

“Absolutely,” the man replied. “It’s looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we’ve ever seen.”

“How can you be so sure?” the chief asked.

The weatherman replied, “The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood.”",Late fall and the Indians on a remote reservation in North Dakota asked their new chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild.,17

So the next day, the farmer goes to a reputable breeder. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."".

""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know ten languages, seven martial arts and I have a PhD in mathematics."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.

That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".

Dick was the only one who stuck to the childhood dream. He quickly rose in position, becoming influential, gaining an army, learning the art of war and the like.

Harry...well, harry became a wizard. A famous and powerful wizard at that. He had great talent in his field, and he even saved the wizarding world. At least that's what they say.

They met as adults, and dick proudly stated that he was close to completing their childhood dream. He was almost there and all that was lest was attacking a country and taking over. However, the day before the war enemy assassins struck and left dick unconscious, but fortunately alive.

The greatest doctors  took a look at him, but nothing could be done. His life was not in danger, but he was in coma and would not ever wake. 'A potato' was what they described him as.

Shortly after take-off, the Pope took a crossword puzzle out of his carry on bag and began penciling in the answers.

It crossed his mind that if the Pope got stuck, he’d ask him for assistance.

He couldn’t breathe.
He went within himself, thought deeper, longer for a plausible answer and after almost a minute, the dark clouds of evil parted in his mind and the sun shone in.
Turning to the Pope, the gentleman said with reverence and politeness, ""I believe, Your Holiness, that you're looking for the word, 'aunt.'""
""Of course!"" the Pope mused, not taking his gaze off the crossword. ""You wouldn’t happen to have an eraser, would you?""","A guy was boarding a plane when he heard that the Pope was on the same flight. ""This is exciting!"" thought the gentleman.

The doctor said, ""I know exactly what to do, come back next week and bring me an apple and a lemon cookie."" So the man did this. He gave the apple and the lemon cookie to the doctor. The doctor told the man to drop his pants and bend over. First, he shoved the apple up the man's bottom and then waited a minute. Then, he shoved the lemon cookie up his butt and told him he was finished but come back next week with an apple and a lemon cookie.

The man did this. Once again, the doctor told him to drop his pants and bend over. He inserted the apple, waited a minute, inserted the lemon cookie and then informed the man that he was finished but come back next week with an apple and a lemon cookie. The man began looking noticeably frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

The next week, the man reluctantly showed up with the apple and the lemon cookie. The doctor did the exact same thing, and when he was finished the man said, ""Hold up, this treatment is NOT working! The tapeworm is still in there and if I can be perfectly honest, I am getting pretty fucking tired of shoving apples and lemon cookies up my ass!"" The doctor said, ""Not to worry, next week will be your final treatment, bring me an apple and a hammer."" The man glared at him, worried that he was going to shove that hammer up his ass.

&amp;#x200B;

The next week rolled around and the man did what he was told once again. The doctor told him to drop his pants. The doctor inserted the apple. Waited a minute. Waited another minute. During the third minute, the tapeworm stuck his head out of the man's butthole and said, ""Hey, where is my lemon cookie?"" Before the worm had a chance to retreat, the doctor smashed its head in with the hammer. The End.",Tapeworm Therapy,15

Both poets read poems back to back for 12 hours, each poem as good as the last. After the 12th hour the judge’s became exhausted and realized that this may never end as both poets were equally amazing. They had to decide a winner and they had to decide it now. So they called a recess and went to a separate room to come up with a way of figuring this out. After a hour they came back and called in the poets. The head judge addressed them proclaiming “Both of you are the creme of the crop, the top of your game and we cannot decide who is better so we have come up with a single elimination spontaneous poem based on a random subject that neither one of you have ever mentioned in all of your work. You will have exactly 1 minute to prepare your poem and after both contestants have read their work we will decide. The subject is Timbuktu!” 
Both poets immediately started to contemplate their upcoming feat and after 30 seconds the first poet stepped forward. “Esteemed judges, I Am ready.” He cleared his throat, “Timbuktu by Robert Frost of London England.....Ye as I walk across this foreign land, i feel my feet upon the sand, I see a train coming thru, on its way to Timbuktu” the judges looked at eachother with agreement that this was a poet at his prime. They thanked him and Mr Frost stepped back. The next Poet stepped up with a grin and addressed the judges. “My Poem is ready sirs and Madams, Timbuktu by Ollie Johnson of Ballard Washington.....Tim and I a hunting we went, when we spotted three maidens in a tent, well they was three and we was two, so I bucked one and Tim Bucked Two.",Once Upon A Time there was a International Poets Contest. All the poets from across the lands came to compete bringing there best original work to compete against their peers. For 40 days and nights they competed eliminating Poet after Poet.,12

""I ran to the window and saw a naked man hanging by his fingers. Enraged, I began to strike him until he finally let go, plunging five stories to what I assumed would be his death. Unfortunately the bastard landed in some bushes and I could see he was still moving. So I ran back into our house and with all the adrenalin I managed to carry my fridge to the window and drop it on the man who had been shtooping my wife.""

""After all of that excitement I think I had a heart attack, because I remember a searing pain in my chest and then I was here.""

St. Peter is entertained by the man's story and tells him to enter into heaven. Then the saint turns to the next man in line and says, ""How did you arrive in heaven my child?""

""Well,"" says the man ""I has just finished taking a shower and was drying off when I tripped and fell, naked, out the window.""

""I managed to grab hold of the window ledge below mine and was trying to pull myself up when a crazy man came to the window and started punching me in the face!""

""He hit me so hard I lost my grip and plummeted to the ground. Luckily, I landed in some bushes. Dazed, I tried to crawl away but this lunatic proceeded to drop a fridge on my head!""

Smarter than even the doctors and healthcare professionals themselves. 

While he was checking the books, he turned to the executive of the hospital and said “I notice you buy a lot of bandages. What do you do with the middle of the roll ?""

""Good question,"" noted the executive. ""We save them up and send them back to the bandage company and every once in a while, they send us a free roll. We recycle whenever possible""

""Oh,"" replied Trump, somewhat disappointed that his unusual question had a practical answer. But on he went, ""What about all these coloured casts you dispense. Isn't it rather a waste of money?""

""Ah, yes,"" replied the executive, realising that Trump was trying to trap him. ""We ask that any patient wishing a coloured cast donates $1 which is far in excess of the 10 cent the colouring actually costs.""

Trump was determined to fluster the know-it-all executive. So he turned to the Head Nurse and asked, ""Well, What do you do with all the remains from the circumcision surgeries?""

""Here, too, we do not waste,"" answered the Head Nurse, ""What we do is save all the foreskins and send them to the government, and about once a year, at this time, they send us a complete prick.""",Trumps Healthcare,3

Professor told dirty jokes in class and the women wanted to protest it. 

So they decided that in the next time that the professor will start with these kinds of jokes,they all will leave the class as a protest.

In the next lecture,in the beginning of the lecture he said : ""in Sweden a prostitute makes $2000 per night.""

The doctor tried his best to stop, but it wasn't possible.

He immediately pulled the car to the side and got out to see if he could help the poor bunny. It didn't look good. He raced back to the car to retrieve his bag, but realized almost instantly that he was driving his wife's car and so his bag would not be there.

He rooted through the glovebox, trying to find gauze or water - anything that could be useful. He found a bottle of what he expected was water and brought it back to where the bunny was laying. With great care, he poured a cap full and let the bunny drink.

To the doctor's amazement, the rabbit sprang back to life - jumping up on his hinds and wiggling his tail. He smiled at the doctor and waved as he began to prance back toward the woods. He hopped a couple of feet, paused, turned and waved again. Another few feet and he turned and waved again. He reached the edge of the trees and again, he turned and waved at the doctor.

Stunned, the doctor brought the bottle up to the light to see what magic potion he had discovered. Squinting his eyes, he read the label aloud, ""Hair restorer with permanent wave"".","An old ""Dad Joke"" from my collection that my son just retold tonight and nailed it.

His mother tells him no breakfast until he does his chores. Well, he's a little pissed off, so he goes to feed the chickens, and he kicks a chicken. 

He goes to feed the cows, and he kicks a cow. He goes to feed the pigs and he kicks a pig. He goes back in for breakfast and his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal. 

""How come I don't get any eggs and bacon? Why don't I have any milk in my cereal?"" he asks. 

""Well,"" his mother says, ""I saw you kick a chicken, so you don't get any eggs for a week. I saw you kick the pig, so you don't get any bacon for a week either. I also saw you kick the cow, so for a week you aren't getting any milk."" 

Just then, his father comes down for breakfast and kicks the cat halfway across the kitchen. 

The father sits down in his chair and picks up the paper. “Hey dad, mom saw you kick the cat, so you know what that means!” 

“What? 

“No pussy for a week!” Johnny cries laughing. 

Johnny's father, without looking up at him or his mother, says, “How the fuck is that different from any other week?” 

Upon hearing all of this, Johnny's sister runs out of the house and dashes for the rooster pen, only to get tackled by her father midway.

When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures, stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and children's art. We don't have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours.  


2. Don't write anything down. Ever. We can play back the error messages from here.  


3. When an I.T. person says he's coming right over, go for coffee. That way you won't be there when we need your password. It's nothing for us to remember 300 screen saver passwords.  


4. When you call the help desk, state what you want, not what's keeping you from getting it. We don't need to know that you can't get into your mail because your computer won't power on at all.  


6. When I.T. support sends you an E-Mail with high importance, delete it at once. We're just testing.  


7. When an I.T. person is eating lunch at his desk, walk right in and spill your guts right out. We exist only to serve.  


8. Send urgent email all in uppercase. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.  


9. When the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support. There's electronics in it.  


10. When you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call computer support. We can fix your telephone line from here.  


11. When you have a dozen old computer screens to get rid of, call computer support. We're collectors.  


12. When something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on an I.T. person's chair with no name, no phone number and no description of the problem. We love a puzzle.  


13. When an I.T. person tells you that computer screens don't have cartridges in them, argue. We love a good argument.  


14. When an I.T. person tells you that he'll be there shortly, reply in a scathing tone of voice : ""And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?"". That motivates us.  


15. When the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently get sucked into black holes.  


16. When the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the company. One of them is bound to work.  


17. Don't learn the proper name for anything technical. We know exactly what you mean by ""my thingy blew up"".  


18. Don't use on-line help. On-line help is for wimps.  


19. If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse cables were designed to have 20kg of computer sitting on top of them.  


20. If the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on the mail upgrade. Keyboards are actually very happy with half a pound of muffin crumbs and nail clippings in them.  


21. When you get a message saying ""Are you sure?"" click on that Yes button as fast as you can. Hell, if you weren't sure, you wouldn't be doing it, would you ?  


22. When you find an I.T. person on the phone with his bank, sit uninvited on the corner of his desk and stare at him until he hangs up. We don't have any money to speak of anyway.  


23. Feel perfectly free to say things like ""I don't know nothing about that computer crap"". We don't mind at all hearing our area of professional expertise referred to as crap.  


24. When you need to change the toner cartridge in a printer, call I.T. support. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only by a professional engineer with a master's degree in nuclear physics.  


25. When you can't find someone in the government directory, call I.T. Support.  


26. When you have a lock to pick on an old file cabinet, call I.T. Support. We love to hack.  


27. When something's the matter with your computer, ask your secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of having to deal with a third party who doesn't know anything about the problem.  


28. When you receive a 30mb (huge) movie file, send it to everyone as a mail attachment. We've got lots of disk space on that mail server.  


29. Don't even think of breaking large print jobs down into smaller chunks. Somebody else might get a chance to squeeze a memo into the queue.  


30. When an I.T. person gets on the elevator pushing $100,000 worth of computer equipment on a cart, ask in a very loud voice: ""Good grief, you take the elevator to go DOWN one floor?!?"" That's another one that cracks us up no end.  


31. When you lose your car keys, send an email to the entire company. People out in Birmingham like to keep abreast of what's going on.  


32. When you bump into an I.T. person at the grocery store on a Saturday, ask a computer question. We do weekends.  


33. Don't bother to tell us when you move computers around on your own. Computer names are just a cosmetic feature.  


34. When you bring your own personal home PC for repair at the office, leave the documentation at home. We'll find all the settings and drivers somewhere.  


35. In no way do we believe that end-users are ungrateful. It hurts our feelings that one could even think such a thing on the basis of the above statements. In truth we wish to express our deepest gratitude to the hundreds of wonderful end-users portrayed herein, without whom none of this would have been remotely possible.

The young man tries to go to sleep, but the farmer's daughter beckons him over and he can't resist. She gives him the best night of his life, and he ends up staying in her room until 5 am. He asks the daughter ""When does your father wake up?"" She replies ""6 am."" He scrambles to fix the eggs he broke, supergluing them seamlessly and cleaning up the mess and hopping into bed right before the farmer comes into the room. The farmer sees the unbroken eggs and is impressed with the young man, so he treats the young man to breakfast. He grabs a few eggs off the floor and prepares them for breakfast, cracking them against a pan. Unfortunately, all four eggs are empty, since by random chance the farmer chose only broken eggs to cook. The farmer, enraged, grabs his shotgun and screams red-faced at the top of his lungs, ""GOD DAMMIT! THAT DAMN ROOSTER IS USING RUBBERS AGAIN!""",A young man's truck breaks down in rural Georgia right next to a farm,22
