Dearest Redneck Son...


I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast.
 We don't live where we did when you left home.
 Your Dad read in the newspaper that most accidents
 happen within 20 miles of your home, so we moved.

I won't be able to send you the address
 because the last family that lived here
 took the house numbers when they moved
 so they wouldn't have to change their address. 

 This place even has a washing machine.
 I'm not sure it works so well though.
 Last week I put a load of clothes in and  pulled the chain.
 We haven't seen them since. I hope they come back soon,
 like I told your dad we shouldn't have to wear
 the same clothes more than a week.

About that coat you wanted me to send;
 your Uncle Billy Bob said it would
 be too heavy to send in the mail
 with the buttons on, so we cut them off
 and put them in the pockets.

Bubba locked his keys in the car yesterday.
 We were really worried because it took him two
 hours to get me and your father out. 

Your sister had a baby this morning,
 but I haven't found out what it is yet, so I don't know if you are an aunt or uncle.

 Uncle Bobby Ray fell into a whisky vat last week.
 Some men tried to pull him out,
 but he fought them off and drowned.
 We had him cremated. He burned for three days.

Three of your friends went
 off a bridge in a pickup truck.
 Butch was driving.
 He rolled down the window and swam to safety.
 The other two were in the back.
 They drowned because they couldn't 
 get the tailgate down.

There isn't much more news at this time.
 Nothing much out of the normal has happened.

Your Favorite Auntiee



P.S. Sorry, I forgot to put some money inside before sealing the envelope, 
       but I love you n I'll try my darndest to send some with the next letter

post,3lemv6,2qh72,jokes,false,1442562193,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3lemv6/a_father_and_son/,self.jokes,,"A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?'

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

Father,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

Father,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.

I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

Dear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.
The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. 

So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.

Dearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.
The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

Father,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.'
That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

`I- I-'

Then he died.",A father and son.,1

post,3lee46,2qh72,jokes,false,1442555684,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3lee46/the_lama_joke/,self.jokes,,"There was a farmer, called Billy.
Billy was a simple man, who never really cared much for farming as a child, but when his dad died he enherited the farm, and as he got older, the more he enjoyed it. 
For a vast majority of years he was a vegetable farmer, farming vegetables such as carrots and cabbages, potatoes and leeks. This was nice simple farming, no hassle. But as time went on and he reached his late 50s, he wanted more from farming, and decided that he wanted to rear some animals, but no ordinary animals like pigs and cows, he wanted to bring some exotic meat to the market.
He went online, to check out some some exotic animals that he could have on his farm, scrolling through endless websites to find the right animal for his farm. From crocodiles to flamingos, to lions to zebras, nothing quite felt right. Until one day, he stumbled across the website about Lamas. He read deeply about these majestic animals and decided that these were defiantly the animal he was looking for, to keep on his farm.
So the next morning he went down to the local lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, and purchased 10 lamas.
He was extremely excited about his purchase and while he was waiting for his lamas to be delivered, he built them a large enclosure in one of his fields for them to run around in and do lama related activities.
They were delivered and Billy the farmer had never been happier. He fed them and groomed them before bed, making sure they were happy, and then went to sleep. 
The next morning he woke up and straight away ran downstairs to check on his lamas, like an excited child on Christmas.
But to his shock, when he checked on them, he noticed that all of their legs had fallen off, and they were just laying there on the ground, legless.
He was appalled that he had been sold dodgy lamas, so he drive straight down to the lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, next to lama world and bed bath and lama.
He walked in the shop and said to the main behind the counter. 
""Hey, you sold me dodgy lamas, I woke up this morning and my lamas had no legs""
""Oh well I am sorry"" said the man behind the counter ""please, take 10 more lamas on the house""
The famer, who was a sucker for a bargain, decided to take up his offer, and went home smiling.
Later that afternoon, his new lamas had been delivered and they were in the enclosure, rubbings around and doing lama related activities. He fed them and groomed them and made sure they were happy, and want off to bed.
The next morning he woke from his slumber, and decided to go check on his lamas, to make sure they were ok this time. 
To his annoyance, these lamas has been stricken with the same fate as the previous. They were all laying there with their on the ground with no legs.
The famer, enfutated, drive down to the lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, opposite Lama Hut, and burst in the door.
""It happened again"" said the farmer ""their legs have fallen off""
""Oh goodness gracious me"" said the man behind the counter ""I am so sorry this has never happened before,  please take 20 lamas, and a full refund if your money""
Seeing no bad outcome with the deal, the farmer graciously accepted and went home. 
The lamas were delivered as before and the famer fed them and tended to them, and even read them a bedtime story. 
But when he woke in the morning, and checked on them, all their legs had fallen off.
He went down to the lama shop, and said to the man behind the counter.
""Its happened again, this isn't funny any more, I want to speak to your manager""
""Ok Sir, fantastic, it's just through that door"" said the man behind the counter, pointing to a door to the left of him. 
The farmer opens this door to find a very long hallway. 
He walks down this hallway for a good 15 minutes until he finally reached a door, which ends up being locked. 
He walks back down the hallway and says to the man behind the counter; ""the door at the end is locked"" 
""Oh my apologies"" said the man behind the counter, and hands the farmer a key.
The farmer walks down the hallway again, reaches the door and opens it with the key.
Upon opening the door, he finds himself in a jungle of some sort, and keeps going, as he is determined to talk to the manager about his lama. Related issues.
He walks through this jungle for 40 days and 40 nights, and finally reaches a door. Which is locked. 
So he walks back through the jungle for 40 days and 40 nights, back down the hallway and says to the man behind the counter; ""there was a jungle and at the end there was another locked door""
""Ahhhhh"" says the man behind the counter ""and hands him another key.
They farmer walks down the hallway and through the jungle and opens the second door, to find a desert. He walks this desert for 40 days and 40 nights and comes to another door, which is locked. He walks all the way back to the man behind the counter and says ""there is another locked door""
The man behind the counter hands him another key and says ""sorry this is the last one""
The farmer walks down the hallway, through the jungle, through the desert and finds himself at a swamp. He crafts a boat and paddles through this swamp for 40 days and 40 nights. Until he finally reaches a door, that says 'managers office' on the front. 
He knocks on the door and it slowly opens, revealing a room where everything is suspended off the floor with lama legs. 
He says to the manager, sitting in his lama leg chair, behind his desk held up by lama legs; ""please, you have got to help me, why do the legs keep falling off my lamas""
""I don't know mate"" replied the manager.

When he was a little bit older, about 18 or 20, he applied to drive cable cars as a job. He landed it and set out on his first time. It was so exciting and fun, the very thing he loved since he was just a young boy he was now driving, this was all to amazing for him. A few months later, he wasn't paying attention and struck a pedestrian, killing him. The case wasn't that long, and the verdict was the death penalty. They gave him a request for a last meal, and he decided to go with a chocolate chip cookie and an ice cold lemonade. Pretty basic, he received a .25 cent cookie and a .50 cent lemonade, he was pretty mad that they gave him such cheap items but he enjoyed his meal and got ready to be put in the electric chair. The executioner stepped up, set the voltage to low, and flipped the lever, but strangely, nothing happened at all. The officials saw this as an act of god and let him go free. It was only about a week or so he realized that operating the cable cars was something he was destined to do. He begged and pleaded and begged and pleaded, and after a while, he eventually got his job back, his boss was a little hesitant but he decided to keep an eye on him for a little bit. He was so thrilled that he got his job back, and was enjoying every second. He knew this was the right job for him. Unfortunately, he drove the cable car past a stop sign and hit a car, killing both occupants of the vehicle. The court was a little hesitant to try and execute him, but they decided to give it another go. He requested his last meal, the same as last time, except now, he got a .50 cent cookie and a .75 cent lemonade. Still cheap, but he couldn't complain. He got set up in the chair, and the executioner did a double check on everything, made sure everything was working and in order. He set the setting to medium and pulled the lever. But, as it happened last time, nothing occurred. They let him free again, but on parole. He didn't even try to get his job back, he simply hijacked a cable car and started operating it. He thought back to the electric chair, and thought of an experiment. He targeted a small group of girl scouts and plowed through them. Blood and limbs flew everywhere, no mercy was had. 3 died and 4 survived, needing critical treatment for injuries and major therapy. This time, there wasn't even a court session. However they still granted him a last meal. Again, he ordered a cookie and a lemonade. They gave him a 2.00 dollar cookie and a 5.00 glass of lemonade. Living the high life here with these cookies eh? He strolled up to the chair, strapped himself in, and happily waited for the executioner. The executioner walked in, set it to maximum, and did a quadruple check on the machine. And a double check, just to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that he was going to die. He pulled the lever, but yet again, nothing happened, the electric current could even be heard, but he was still alive and smiling. The executioner, majorly puzzled by this, asked the man, ""How do you not die each time we put you in this chair?"". And He looked up at him and simply said, ""Well, I never was a really good conductor.""  ","There was this guy who liked cable cars,",0

A old man who's been in a nursing home for many years starts bugging the administrator to let him have a weekend pass, to 'sow his last wild oats', he says, before he finally passes on. Every week he asks the same question and every week he's turned down.
Months later there's a change of staff, with a much younger administrator assigned to the home. Our man starts right away with his weekend request. The new administrator has a little more compassion than the last one and says to the old man, ""If I let you go for a weekend, will you promise me you'll return on Monday morning?"" Ecstatic, the old man swears on his grandmother's grave and he's awarded his wish.
Friday evening comes and the old man calls a cab. He heads straight to the nearest bar. He nurses a few beers for a while when in walks an old woman and sits at the end of the bar. Our man starts giving her the 'high sign', sends down several drinks, and is finally welcomed to sit by her. They chat for a while and he eventually talks her into going to a motel close by.
All Friday night they go at it,,,,,,,,,,all day Saturday,,,,,Saturday afternoon,,,,,,,,Saturday evening,,,,,,,,,(they did go to church on Sunday morning),,,,,,,,,then back at it all day Sunday,,,,, and into Sunday night. An entire weekend of unprotected sex.
True to his word, our man returns to the nursing home on Monday morning, smiling a very satisfied smile. The administrator welcomes him back and the old man thanks him again and again.
Several days later the old man wakes up, only to find a yellowish discharge coming from his penis. ""Oh, my God!!"", he thinks to himself,,,,,,,""94 years old and I'm going to die with a disease"".
He sees the staff doctor that afternoon. The doc checks him over, running numerous tests and then, with a grim, studied look at the chart, says to the old man, ""Have you had sexual intercourse within the last week or so?""
The old man hangs his head in disappointment and shame, knowing he's contracted an STD, then says with a sorrowful sigh,,,,,,""Well, yes I have"".
The doc looks him straight in the eye and says, ""Well you better get back there. You're just about ready to come"".","hangs his head in disappointment and shame, knowing he's contracted an STD,",5

""That's just the guy I need."" says the manager, so he goes through multiple channels to find a way to contact this man.

""But mom...""

""I don't care what you have to say! Your brother was stabbed at the market yesterday! your uncle almost died because of a crossfire from a gunfight! your sister was assaulted in broad daylight at the marketplace yesterday!"" She angrily ranted

''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it.  It only costs $10.""  Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store.  Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.  After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:  You have tennis elbow.  Soak your arm in warm water.  Avoid heavy lifting.  It will be better in two weeks."" Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.  He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.  He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: ""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.  Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.  They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

the woman, wiping her ears out while trying to maintain a weak smile, asks him to repeat what he said.

""my dog's name is Semen,"" he says again casually, squinting into the distance after his dog.

the woman gives a perplexed scowl, but after a second she begins to nod and scratch her chin while looking out at the horizon, seemingly trying to make sense of what she just heard.

""she's named after my granddaughter,"" the young man quickly adds, smiling, as if attempting to clear up any possible confusion.

at this point, with her worst fears being confirmed, the woman's initial curiosity gives way to what is surely utter consternation, as her pleasant demeanor quickly transforms into a look of shock. just as she is about to leave in disgust, the young man turns to the woman, smiles, and says playfully,

""i'm just fucking with you...""

the woman, pausing for a moment to take in all this information, slowly gathers herself and then finally breaks into a huge grin and erupts with thunderous laughter and the young man joins in as well.

He had been going through rough times, with his wife leaving him for his best friend. One day on the job, he saw a young woman, probably in her early 20's signalling for the bus. Bob couldn't hold his rage in anymore and vented his frustration on the pedal, killing the woman on impact. Bob was taken to court for his crime and was sentenced to death by 5 minutes on the electric chair. Bob miraculously lived the electrocution and was let to live a normal life once again.

Surprisingly, Bob's employer let him keep the job and he continued driving accident-free until one day, when his dog Maya mysteriously passed away. Bob fell into depression and became mentally unstable. The next day on the job, he saw an old woman, probably in her late 60's signalling for the bus. Once again, Bob could not hold in his rage and stepped on the gas, killing the old woman instantly. Bob was taken to court once again and was sentenced to 30 minutes on the electric chair for repeating the offence. Once again, Bob miraculously survived the electrocution and was let to lead a normal life once again.

Bob's employer, being a good friend of his let him keep the job on the condition that if such a tragedy were to happen again, he would instantly lose the job. Bob decided to leave the past behind and lead the rest of his life through love and compassion. One day on the job, and old man, probably in his early 70's signalled for the bus. Bob carefully stopped the bus so that the old man could get on, but at that very moment the old man collapsed due to heart attack. Everyone thought that Bob ran over the man and so he was taken to court one more time. Verdict was passed that Bob would have to sit in the electric chair for 10 hours. This time, Bob succumbed to the electrocution and died.

Why did Bob die to electrocution the third time?

Ridge is a math major, and he starts determining how much money it would cost to print the words on William's book on a giant plaque. William is making fun of him for being nerdy, and Sam is laughing at him because he is also a math guy. 

Ridge begins having a panic attack because it's getting too hard to do, the equation is getting intense and he begins sweating profusely. He starts heating up and goes into a heat stroke. ""The only way to fix it is to finish the equation and find out how much the words are worth!"" he screams. 

Richard, being the natural leader, takes over and yells at Sam to finish the equation: ""Sam, you'll cool Ridge with William's words' worth!"" 

The teacher shouts ""This is the Victorian Period, not the Romantics!""

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...
And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...
And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",A politician dies...,10996

The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.

The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa.""

Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep.

The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00.""

This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.

The lawyer asks the first question.

""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?""

The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer.

""Okay"" says the lawyer, ""your turn.""

She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?""

The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer.

Frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.

The blonde says, ""Thank you"", and turns back to get some more sleep.

The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?""

Without a word the blonde shrugs, reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

""After a long week of work,"" Jasmine said with News reporter Ann Rox, ""I like to enjoy my early mornings with a nutrition, delicious burrito bowl""--after cheerfully adding--""and the tortilla on the side!"" 

Crystal, Jasmine longtime life partner, used to dislike eating at Chipotle but ever since the fully divested from McDonalds in 2006, she has been eating Chipotle ""practically everyday."" 

""It wasn't that I didn't like Chipotle,"" Crystal said, ""it was because Chipotle was financially dependent with McDonald. And we all know the McDonald's stories: pink slime, processed apples, fries (which admittedly, I like actually) that doesn't mold--and I'm like: No thank you."" 

While McDonalds has been caught with a number of lawsuits, such as ""hot"" coffee causes third degree burn, there is the entity side of McDonalds--they're adverse effect on society--that drives customers away. In one particular instance potential customers are fooled into thinking McDonald's is the ""right"" choice in their dining needs. In a recent ad campaign, however, funded by Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine many physicians were beginning to remember how unhealthy McDonalds is. ""We wanted to reminded everyone,"" certified pediatrician Dr. Ouchi said, ""that McDonald is bad. That's why we physicians started the campaign Tonight, Make it Vegetarian hoping it makes people eat more salads--and less meat."" 

""Just other day,"" Crystal said, ""I saw ad on YouTube. Usually I would just skip it. Make it Vegetarian' the ad read. At first I was like, okaaay, then I was like: Isn't there a way I can enjoy a vegetarian diet and a carnivore one?"" 

At press time there has much research done on the effects of the digestion system. One study showed people actually enjoy diverticulitis; the causing increase of gas and decongestion. In the book, ""Abnormalities and other gases"" written by Dr. Stinker, however, he suggest: there are a numbers of things that may cause discomfort in the bowels. ""At the most core diet possible,"" Dr. Stinker suggest, ""clients should take into consideration of nutrition value diets. Any diet which is high in calories, protein, carbohydrates, calcium, iron, zinc, sodium, potassium, and other important nutritions that are hard to pronounce."" According to his study, he also suggests clients to be a ""little more responsible"" in their choice of ""take out food."" ""A little more vegetables--and a lot less fatty food,"" he claimed. ""My personal advice is Chipotle.""

""It wasn't until I saw a Chipotle ad I was convinced,"" Crystal continues, ""it was the healthy choice."" 

Since then Jasmine and Crystal have both lost a combined weight of 75 pounds. They're success, that they claim is ""eating more Chipotle--because its good for you!"" In addition to their diet plan, they continue doing intense workout session with Tony Horton. ""'Never quit!'"" said Crystal quoting Tony Horton himself.

Suddenly, a seeing-eye-dog burst into the changing room Roy was undressing in, gobbled down Roy's loafers and ran out. Since Roy was pantless and astonished, he couldn't go chasing after the dog. He didn't really feel like shopping anymore, so he put his jeans back on and walked out in his sock feet. He informed mall security and they escorted him to the control booth so he would look at the surveillance cameras to try to spot the guilty canine. The mall security looked and looked at footage while Roy had some coffee someone had offered him out of pity. Well, finally, the security guard thought he saw the culprit on screen in another part of the mall. He motioned to the hapless victim and lamely said,

He is extremely excited and brings his best friend along with him. He takes a bus to the docks and when he sees the boat his jaw drops.
Never in his life had he seen such a magnificent boat. It seemed a kilometer long and at least 40 meters high. There was an Olympic sized pool on the deck and enough room for at least a thousand people aboard. Henry and his friend are shown their rooms and they are in awe. They each had a huge room with a large comfortable bed, A huge flatscreen television and a spacious bathroom with a shower and bath.
Henry's friend wants to nap but Henry is interested in exploring and meeting the people aboard. Everybody on the ship seems extremely posh and uninteresting to him except for one person. By the pool an old hairy man is fiddling with an extremely large machine. Henry approaches and introduces himself. The old man does the same. His name is Valentino and he lives on the ship permanently. In his head Henry wonders how he could afford permanent residence on this luxury cruise but he refrains from asking out loud. Henry is curious about the machine and asks about it. Valentino states that he had been working on it for almost 17 years and that it was almost complete and that it was called ""The Kerplunk"".
Henry asks what it does. Valentino simply replies with ""wait and see"". Henry questions no further and decides to take a swim. After a while it is late and Henry decides to sleep. The next day Henry takes his friend go to see Valentino. His friend asks again what the machine can do. He responds with ""wait and see"". This happens for a few more days until Valentino claims to have had a breakthrough and that his invention is finally complete.
All of the passengers and the entire crew of the ship gather around. He says that it is finally complete except for one thing. He claims that he needs a two dollar bill to put on top of the machine to work. Nobody on the ship seems to have one. Except for Henry's friend, a collector of odd coins and bills. Henry's friend does not want to part with the 2 dollar bill but Valentino tells him that this is the only thing that could make the machine work and he gradually acquiesces.
Valentino slowly takes the 2 dollar bill, and turns on the machine. A loud humming noise is heard. Suddenly Valentino rips up the two dollar bill, and then picks up the machine and throws it into the ocean and the machine goes ""kerplunk"".",The kerplunk,0

The man is now at the fourth floor window, and inside is a woman more beautiful than any he has ever seen, and wearing nothing at all! She says, ""you can either have sex with me, or continue climbing the ladder to success."" 

At this point the man is happier than he has ever been in his life! ""Are there two women up top? Maybe there's money as well? What could possibly be better than this!?"" Curiosity now filled him, excitement causing his heart to beat faster and faster, and he decided he must find out what the ladder had in store! 

Now the man was racing up the ladder, he moved so fast he flew right by the fifth window where he catches a glimpse of two of the most beautiful women he has ever seen! He finally makes it to the top of the ladder and is completely shocked by what he see's, so much that he becomes weak and almost falls! 

Inside the sixth floor window there is a man more fat and disfigured than any person you ever thought could have existed. He wheezes heavily, covered in sweat. In a struggled slow voice he says, ""hi, I'm Cess.""",The ladder to success.,4

""Sure son I will tell you about Buddha and the 3 cows."" 

 Once upon a time Buddha was meandering down a pathway when he encountered 3 impoverished youths. Buddha told the youths that he would grant them a cow to help them with their situation but the youth that could come up with the best use of the cow would become his successor. 

The first youth eagerly proclaimed, ""I will take the cow to my village and use it to feed everyone for a week. I will make sure the hide is used to make clothing for myself and so that no part is wasted.""

""Definitely a great use of a cow and a selfless act. You surely deserve a cow"", Buddha granted him plumpest bovine.


The second youth clamored in, ""Buddha I will take the cow home and nurture it. We will enjoy fresh milk from the cow until the day it dies years to come.""

Buddha was surprised ""Ingenious thinking my child and a sign of a kind heart. You deserve this cow.""

The third child thought about his answer and said ""I will bring the cow home to be sex toy"" and that is when Buddha knew he had found his successor.

""Wait Dad this doesn't make any sense why would Buddha reward someone for copulating with a cow"", asked the son.

""Because Buddha in all of his wisdom knew that fornicating with a cow is better off than risking marrying a heifer like your mother.""",Buddha and the 3 Cows,8

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

 After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. 

 They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. 

 ""I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,"" she explained. ""I'm afraid neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."" 

 ""Don't worry,"" Jack said. ""We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light."" 

 The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. 



 About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. 

 It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. 

 He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, ""Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from....."" ""Yes, I do."" 

 ""Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?"" 

 ""Yes,"" Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. ""I have to admit that I did.""
