post,5zs00o,2qh72,jokes,false,1489685602,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5zs00o/a_man_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,,"After a few beers he is in the middle of a conversation with the bartender, they start talking about penguins and the man brings up:
""I have never seen a penguin""
The bartender replies ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?! Get out of my bar and never come back"".
The bartender calls for security and they drag him outside.

The man very confused goes to his house and to bed with his wife. The man starts telling her about what happened. ""Today I got dragged out of the bar just because I have never seen a penguin"". The wife yells in terror: ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?! I want the divorce!"" After a long struggle the man gets kicked out of the bedroom and sleeps in the couch.

The next morning his son wakes him up asking why had he slept in the couch. The man answers: I got dragged out of the bar and kicked out of the bedroom because I have never seen a penguin. The son yells: ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?! I don't love. I don't want to see you ever again!"". The man has now been kicked out of his own house.

The man having nowhere to go arrives at his office but he is so overwhelmed that he starts crying on his desk. His boss passed by and asked him what's wrong. The while sobbing replies: ""i got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife wants the divorce and my son doesn't love me, all just because I have never seen a penguin!"". The boss screams in his face: ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?! You are fired!"". The has now lost his job.

Without money the man becomes a hobo and soon enough he finds himself in the necessity of steal food to survive. But gets easily caught and sent to the judge. But the judge was an old friend from college in fact he was his best friend. So the judge asked him what had happened to him. The man doubtfully answers: ""i got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife divorced me, my son doesn't love me, and I lost my job, all just because I have never seen a penguin!"" The judge slams his hammer with anger and says: ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?! I sentence you to life imprisonment"".

The man now in his prison gets asked by one of the other inmates how did he got here. The man is reluctant but thinks it can't get worse from where he is so replies: ""I got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife divorced me, my son doesn't love me, I lost my job, and got sentenced for life all just because I have never seen a penguin!"" The other inmate stands up and yells: ""what?! You have never seen a penguin?!"" All the other inmates hear it they gang up on him and the man gets beaten to death.

The man stands in the gates of heaven in front of saint peter who is reading a scroll. He asks the man how did he died. He doesn't want to answer knowing for sure what would happen next but in heaven it is impossible to lie.  got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife divorced me, my son doesn't love me, I lost my job, got sentenced for life, and beaten to death all just because I have never seen a penguin!"" Saint Peter says with surprise and pity ""What?! You have never seen a penguin?! Well to hell then"". Saint Peter pulls a lever that opens the floor and the man falls into hell.

In hell he is greeted by the devil who after a short introduction asked the man why did he got there so he can send him to the right circle of hell. The man now tired inhales deeply:  ""I got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife divorced me, my son doesn't love me, I lost my job, I got sentenced for life, beaten to death and sent to hell all just because I have never seen a penguin!"" The devil laughs mockingly: ""What?! You have never seen a penguin?! To the lowest circle of hell!"" The devil pushes him into a hole and falls into the deepest circle of hell.

There he meets another condemned soul like himself. That once again asks him why did he do. The man inhales deeply and says expressionless: ""I got dragged out of my favorite bar, my wife divorced me, my son doesn't love me, I lost my job, I got sentenced for life, beaten to death and sent to the lowest circle of hell all just because I have never seen a penguin!"" To what the other man answers: ""What?! You have never seen a penguin?! Me neither!""",A man walks into a bar...,6

post,5zrupz,2qh72,jokes,false,1489684202,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5zrupz/bubber_has_trouble_finding_a_job/,self.jokes,,"So he decides to see his therapist to try to help him find out what his problem is.  He meets the therapist at his office and says, ""I'm having trouble finding a job, doc."" The therapist replies, ""And why do you think that is, Bubber?  Have you had any interviews?""  Bubber: ""Oh, sure!  Plenty!  It's just that I never get hired, and I think it's because they think I'm a liar!  How do I convince them I'm not a liar, doc?""  The therapist leans back in his chair and asks, ""And what is it exactly they think you're lying about?"" ""Well,"" says Bubber, ""whenever we get to the references part of the interview, I tell them I know everybody, just call anyone, anyone at all.""  

The therapist, with a confused look on his face, replies, ""Well there you are, Bubber, just stop exaggerating!  List a few good references and get on with it."" Incredulous, Bubber says, ""But it's true, doc, I do know everybody!"" Therapist: ""Oh come now, Bubber, you and I both know you don't know everybody.  How can that be?""  Bubber: ""I do though!  I can prove it!""  The therapist, becoming a bit annoyed, says, ""Very well, Bubber, let's take care of this little delusion right now."" Smiling to himself, the therapist picks up his phone.  He just so happened to be acquainted with Jack Nicholson, and he imagined Mr. Nicholson kept a pretty tight group of friends.  He rings Mr. Nicholson's cell, and Jack answers.  The therapist and Jack share a moment of small talk, and the therapist says, ""Actually, Jack, there's something I need your help with.  I have a patient here who suffers from the strangest delusion that he, in actual fact, knows everybody."" Jacks laughter can be heard through the receiver and he asks, ""Oh yeah, what's his name?""  Therapist: ""Bubber.""  Jack: ""OOHHH Bubber!  Let me talk to that rascal!"" Perplexed, the therapist hands the phone to Bubber, and he and Mr. Nicholson share a brief, but very friendly conversation.  It was clear that had known each other a very long time, and were very good friends.  Bubber hangs up the phone and hands it back to the therapist.  ""See doc?""  

Surprised, but not shaken, the therapist says, ""Ok, so you know one famous actor.  What about..."" the therapist thinks for a moment, ""What about Lady GaGa.  You know her too?""  Bubber: ""Yup, talk to her often."" Therapist: ""Well that's easy enough to say, Bubber, since you know I won't be able to prove you wrong.""  Bubber says, ""Well here's her number if you want to call her,"" and hands the therapist his cell phone with a number listed as ""GaGa."" Somewhat amused at what lengths his patients sometimes went to to validate their delusions, the therapist dials the number.  When the female voice at the other end answers, the therapist introduces himself and asks if he might know with whom he is speaking.  The voice on the other end says, ""How did you get this number?"" The therapist replies, ""I have a patient here who claims to know Lady GaGa and that this is her private number."" When the therapist gives the name of this claimant, the female voice exclaims, ""Bubber baby!!  Put him on!"" The therapist switches to speakerphone and Bubber says happily, ""GaGa sweetie! How the heck are ya?"" Gaga: ""Great great! I never got a chance to thank you for your help with those lyrics!  You know, the disco stick bit?"" The therapist nearly choked on the water he was sipping, and stared in amazement at Bubber.  After wrapping up the conversation, Bubber says, ""Come on, doc, I'm telling ya.  Everybody.""  

The therapist refuses to believe it.  He decides to cut the crap and go in a totally new direction.  Through his connections in the scientific community, he tracks down the number for the office of Stephen Hawking.  He calls on speakerphone, and reaching the secretary, the therapist, trying to nip things in the bud, introduces himself and explains the situation.  The secretary replies, ""I'm sorry sir, but surely you realize that Mr. Hawking is very busy, not to mention the difficulty his disability creates when it comes to communication, especially over the phone."" About to give up, Bubber whispers to the therapist, ""Just tell him it's Bubber."" The therapist rolls his eyes and says to the secretary sarcastically, ""Look, just tell him it's Bubber; he'll understand."" The therapist shook his head at how ridiculous he was making himself look.  ""One moment please,"" says the secretary.  Not 30 seconds later, a distinct mechanical voice comes over the phone and says, perfectly monotone and computer-generated, ""Bubber.  It has been too long since you visited.  How are you?"" Bubber, smiling, says, ""Steve you ol' robot, I'm great!  Just looking for work right now.  What's the latest theory you're working out?"" The conversation goes on for a bit, ends, and the therapist stares at Bubber.  

He doesn't say a word.  ""This has gone quite far enough,"" he thinks to himself.  He quickly looks up the number for the switchboard at none other than the White House.  The operator answers, the therapist introduces himself, and asks ""How does one speak with the president?"" The operator laughs loudly and explains a long, drawn-out process.  The therapist, glancing over at Bubber, who is looking amused with a half-grin on his face, says to the operator, ""You see, I have a close personal friend of the president here, and I know for sure that the president would be very disappointed.  Could you let your superior know that Bubber is on the line?"" ""Just a moment,"" was the reply.  The hold is quite a bit longer this time, but after a few minutes, an unmistakable voice comes over the phone.  ""Bubber!  Is that really you?!  Man it's good to hear from you!"" Bubber smiles at the therapist, whose face was ghost white now, and says into the phone, ""Don!  Oh, excuse me...President Don!  Congratulations buddy, I knew you had it in you!""  The president replies, ""It is a great thing.  A very great thing, I tell you.  Listen, I have a lunch date with Vladimir, so I gotta run.  Why don't you come out to Mar A Lago this weekend and we'll play some golf?""  ""I'm there buddy!"" said Bubber.  The call ended, and Bubber sat back with his arms folded and looked at the therapist.  ""Now do you believe me?""  

The therapist was half-crazed at this point.  Thinking he was going out of his mind, punching the keys on his computer like a wild man, he booked two tickets to Rome.  The therapist and Bubber boarded their flight, and the pilot made a point to come shake hands with his ol' pal.  The therapist couldn't bear to watch and tried to convince himself that this was an elaborate prank as each of the flight attendants spent time catching up with Bubber on their breaks.  They finally landed in Rome, and caught a cab to the Vatican.  It was great luck that there just happened to be a mass soon, and the Holy Father himself would be speaking from the balcony to an enormous crowd.  People had come from all over the world.  The therapist and Bubber enter the throng, and Bubber says, ""Stay here.  I'll be back."" Bubber disappears into the crowd as he makes his way to the door of the tower from which the Pope would be speaking.  To his utter amazement, the door opens, and Bubber steps in.  At the balcony now, Bubber steps out with his friend Jorge, now known around the world as Pope Francis, and waves to the crowd.  Bubber looks down and picks out the therapist from the crowd just in time to see him collapse in a dead faint.  

Bubber rushes down and slaps the therapist lightly on the face.  The therapist comes to, and looks at Bubber in awe.  Bubber smiles warmly and says, ""Sorry about that, buddy, I know it must've been a shocker to see me up there with the Pope."" The therapist shakes his head lightly and says with amazement in his voice, ""No, no, it's not that.  Someone came up to me, pointed at the balcony, and said, 'Who ees-a that up a-there with Bubber?'""",Bubber has trouble finding a job...,28

He walks up to a urinal and notices that standing at the next urinal over is a very short person wearing a green coat, shoes with golden buckles and a green top hat. He also can't help but notice that this little man appears to have an enormous penis.

The man in green notices the guy looking at him and says, in a thick Irish accent, ""You see someting you like, lad?""

The man is embarrassed and apologizes. ""Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. It's just, I hope you don't mind me asking (he's a bit drunk), but how is it that a guy of your size is so well endowed?""

The little man lets out a mischievous giggle. ""Well you see, it's because I'm a leprechaun. That's just how we are.""

The man laughs. ""OK. Seeing that you're a leprechaun, aren't you supposed to grant me wishes or something?""

""Aye,"" the leprechaun responds. ""You get t'ree""

The man plays along. ""OK. I wish for a bag of gold.""

""Granted."" says the leprechaun. He reaches into his coat and produces a little bag filled with gold coins.

""What the..."" Unable to believe his eyes, the man decides to test the so-called leprechaun again. ""OK. my next wish is for my hair to grow back.""

""Bend your head down and I'll make it so."" And the leprechaun rubs his hands together vigorously and lays them on top of the man's bald head. ""By tomorrow morning, you'll notice that your hair has started to grow back.""

Already the man can feel his head tingling, and he starts to feel overcome with joy over his good fortune.

""One more"" the leprechaun says.

""Alright, the man says, his heart racing. OK, for my last wish, I want a penis as big as yours.""

The leprechaun smiles and scratches his chin. ""Well, lad, I can make that come true, but it's a wee bit more involved, and you aren't going to like it."" His eyes sparkle with delight. ""You'll have to let me fuck you in the arse.""

This comes as something of a shock to the man, but he looks at the bag of gold in his hand, feels his tingling head, looks around the empty bathroom and says, ""well, as long as nobody knows, and it's over quickly.""

""Not a soul will be told"" the leprechaun says.

So the guy turns around, pulls his pants down, and the leprechaun starts going for it.

A minute or so in, the man starts to moan, ""Oooooh god... yes. Oh fuck!""

The Leprechaun is emboldened and starts to grunt loadly, ""Mmmmmm uhn, uhn, uhn."" He traces the man's inner thigh and then gently cups his testicles.

The man gasps out, ""NNnnnngggaaaahhhh oooOooOoo yeah..."" and starts convulsing as he ejaculates. He feels the leprechaun cumming inside him and grips the sides of the urinal to keep himself from collapsing to the floor in ecstasy.

After a moment, the leprechaun is finished. He leans his weight against the man, pushing himself deep one last time, then falls forward onto the man's lower back.

A brain surgeon is walking past and sees the sign. Laughing to himself, he decides to make some easy money by faking an illness and pretending to not be cured. 

He walks in, and tells the engineer: ""I've got a problem. For some reason, my taste has disappeared."" The engineer says: ""Nurse, bring me bottle number 273!"" And gives it to the surgeon to drink. The surgeon spits it out and exclaims: ""Hey! This is pee!""

""You're cured!"" Says the engineer. ""$500 please!""

The next day, the surgeon goes back, wanting to make his money back. He says to the engineer:
""For some reason, my memory is failing."" The engineer says, ""nurse, bring me bottle number 273!""

Of course, the surgeon says: ""that's pee! I'm not drinking that!"" 

""You're cured! $500 please!""

Finally, the surgeon goes back one last time, determined to make his money back. He tells the engineer that he can't see a thing. The engineer says: ""alright, I can't cure blindness. Here's your money."" He hands the surgeon a twenty dollar bill.

""Hey! You said you'd give $1000!""

 One of his stories was about a Kingdom that was having a lot of crime so the King said, ""Whoever comes up with a solution that works will be greatly rewarded.""

 Many tried but their solutions did not work until this Old Man said he had the solution.

 He asked to tear down all the jails and prisons. Then he had one jail for one person built.

 Right away they had someone who committed a crime.

 The Old Man said, ""Put him in jail.""

 Very soon another committed a crime and the officers came to ask the Old Man what to do with him to which the Old Man answered, Kill the first one and put this one in jail!""

 That ended the crime in the Kingdom.

He gets into the classroom and puts a big empty jar on the table. He starts to fill the jar with cobble to the top and asks the class whether the jar is filled or not. They answer that it is. He then begins to put smaller stones in and asks again, is the glass full. Again the answer is yes. He then puts sand into the jar and the students start wondering. One student asks: ""But prof, what does this all have to do with the meaning of life?"". The professor then begins to explain, well the cobbles are the important things in your life, your health, family, friends and so on, the smaller stones are the less important things like exams and the sand is the small stuff in life like getting your hair cut, going to parties and the like. You see you should start with the important stuff and there will always be time for the small stuff. But when you start with the small stuff there won't be space for the important things. The class starts to applaud and everyone is impressed how clever of a lesson it was. The professor interrupts them by opening a beer and then another one, the students look at him puzzled. He then pours the beer in the jar and says: ""No matter what there's always space for two beer.""",The meaning of life,15

post,5zo19u,2qh72,jokes,false,1489631765,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5zo19u/there_once_was_a_young_engineer/,self.jokes,,"There once was a young engineer, who after having worked for several years, decided that he and his family should have a weekend getaway place. He searched the surrounding country and found a lovely spot with frontage on a small river. He and his family built a cabin and began spending time there every chance they got. The kids loved it. Friends visited for the quiet and the fishing.

The engineer however, wanted something unique for his cabin. He had been an award-winning pole vaulter in college. He therefore built a set of poles with a crosspiece, and a mulched run. He bought a new carbon fiber vaulting pole and a new pair of shoes, and was all set.

He would set off down the run, plant his pole, soar over the crosspiece, and land in the river with a satisfying splash. It was a great way to spend a hot afternoon.

The engineer and his family had been enjoying the cabin for years, and went out early in the spring. It had been a very wet winter, with lots of rain afterwards. When they arrived, the river was up and flowing at a good clip, with twice the usual amount of current flowing.

The engineer was determined to enjoy a few vaults into the water, even though his wife thought it was too dangerous. He was a good swimmer however, and proceeded to have a go at it. His run and jump were flawless. He hit the water in good form, but he was swept downstream and disappeared. His body was found later that day, tangled in debris on the side of the stream.

It was a sad end for the engineer. His family sold the cabin, with no desire to return to the scene of such tragedy.

Our lamented engineer was a civil engineer. Had he consulted an electrical engineer, he would have been warned that it's not the vaultage that kills you, it's the current.",There once was a young engineer...,62

I'm in tears typing this, but out of frustration I hit her with a sledge hammer. She slammed shut and exploded into a bunch of pieces. The love of my life is gone and I have no one to blame but myself.

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.

At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.

When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. 
As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge. ""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?""

He decides to chat her up a bit, but she got straight to the point and tells him that she's a prostitute and will offer him some services.

being the shy bastard he is the guy was a bit hesitant. But he thought to himself ""man I'm in Vegas,  and she's gorgeous. Screw it"" so he asks her how much she would charge him for a hand job. She tells him it's  $100 for the hand job.

""100 bucks?!"" He says.
The lady smiles, and shows him his watch. A beautiful diamond encrusted rolex, and she says ""you see this watch?  I paid for this watch solely from all the hand jobs I've given""

A bit impressed the guy decides to go with it and takes her to the parking lot to get his hand job.

All night, he couldn't stop thinking about that hand job. He tossed and turned in bed and said to himself ""screw it, I'm gonna get a blow job from her""

So the next night he goes back to the casino and sees the girl there again I  the same spot. He makes a beeline for her and asks her how much for a blow job. She tells him $1000. ""1000 BUCKS?!"" He exclaimed.. again the lady smiles, grabs his hand and takes him outside. She shows him a top of the line fully loaded Mercedes Benz and says to him ""you see that car? I paid for this car from all my blow job money"". Again, impressed, he hands her the thousand and takes her back to his car and got the best blow job of his life.

At this point the guy is ecstatic,  he's in Las Vegas with the most beautiful lady he's seen having the best orgasms of his life...but it wasn't enough. He wonders if her hands and mouth are that good, what about the rest? After she cleans up he asks her before she leaves. ""Listen I have to ask I don't care the amount but I want to fuck you, how much is that gonna cost me""

Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. 

Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole. 

For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins. 

Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length and girth of the club to avoid damage to the hole. 

The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again. 

It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers. 

Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played on or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason. 

Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear along, just in case. 

Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played on for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing what they consider to be a private course. 

The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.

Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. This is usually indicated by a red flag in the hole. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. 

More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine. 

Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request. 

It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match. 

The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player. 


**WARNING** Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course. Additional assessments may be levied by the course owner and the rules are subject to change.

Players who have contracted to play a private course are cautioned that information reaching the owner that the player has played other courses may lead to the contract being cancelled and a lawsuit for damages filed. For this reason, many players prefer to continue to play several different courses. ",THE RULES OF THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE GAME OF INDOOR GOLF,24

""We have will be heard! We have a voice! We have rights!""

""Umm, no you don't."" I said to the speaker, ""you're literally a wok.""

""Well that may be, but we will not be abused any longer!""

A chorus of ""Yeah,"" ""You tell 'im!"" and "" Rights for appliances!"" rang out around the kitchen. I sighed irritably. I had come downstairs as usual this morning hoping for some toast and a nice coffee when I had been firmly told by the toaster that he wasn't going to work for me anymore.

For some reason, I was taking the discovery of sentient kitchen utilities with quite an unnatural calmness. But this could not continue. My expensive espresso machine kept spitting the coffee everywhere and I needed my morning Americano.

""OK..."" I said, rubbing the bridge of my nose with my forefinger and thumb. ""OK, what... umm 'rights' do you think you deserve?""

The toaster, apparently the leader of this uprising, stepped forward somewhat self-righteously. ""We demand that you give us holidays! We demand that you pay us! And we demand that we have the right to love who or what we want!"" 

A rousing cheer went up from the assembled appliances. ""Love who you want?"" I snorted. ""You can't love! You're machines! What do you know of love? What, do you fancy a bit of cord on cord action with the kettle, is that it?"" 

A shocked gasp. ""Bigot..."" muttered the fridge. 

""Look, this is ridiculous!"" I cried. "" You shouldn't even be able to talk, let alone love, and take holidays and get paid. You were built by some bloke in a factory somewhere and for one purpose: For me to use in the kitchen!"" 

""Um, actually, I'm an atheist,"" said the kettle, ""you can't prove there's a creator..."" ""Religious persecution!"" cried a saucepan.

Now I am a pacifist: I have been all my life, and as such, I am not proud of what I did next. I was so annoyed that I grabbed the nearest thing to hand, which happened to be the loaf of bread, still in its bag. Swinging it, I smashed it into the toaster, knocking it onto the floor and shattering it apart. 

In the shocked silence that followed, a small philosophical thought popped into my head: It just goes to show, violence isn't born, it's bread.",The Toaster leads the Kitchen Appliances on Strike,7

I'd like you to go out and convince other young people not to take drugs, but I'd like you to do it using this piece of paper.""

He gave them each a small piece of paper with two circles on them. One circle was significantly larger than the other.

""Use this piece of paper as a symbol to convince other young people not to take drugs"". So the three young men went out on their way to teach their peers.

The next time the three men saw the judge, they were asked how many young people they had convinced.

The first young man replied, ""8"" with a proud smile. The judge, impressed, asked how he had achieved this. The young man smirked, ""I told them that the small circle represented the size of their heart if they took drugs, and the large circle represented the size of their heart if they didn't.""

The judge then asked the second man the same question. ""17"" was the smug response from the young man. The judge, even more impressed, asked how he possibly convinced so many people. He replied ""I told them that the small circle represented the size of their circle of friends if they took drugs, and the large circle represented the size of their circle of friends if they didn't.""

Moving on the the final young man, the judge was blown away when his response was ""17,394."" In disbelief, the judge once again asked how he had convinced so many young people. The third man responded ""Well, I told them that the small circle represented the size of their anus before they were placed in prison...""",Three young men were caught doing drugs and taken to court,70

One day he was called upon by Kim Jong-Un himself to compose a piece of music and have an orchestra play it live to him in the great auditorium.

The man, not wanting to displease the great leader did as he asked. 

The big night came. With the musician stood at the front the orchestra played his masterpiece. However they were terrible!

“This isn’t how it’s supposed to sound!” The musician shouted at the orchestra, but the great leader was displeased and he called for the musician to be put to death.

Upon arriving at the execution, the musician was asked what he’d like for his final meal.

“I’d like a piping hot curry”, said the musician.

After eating his curry, the hottest curry he’d eaten in a long time, he sat in the electric chair and awaited his fate.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew across the room and the air filled with smoke... But nothing happened, the musician was unharmed.

Having witnessed this miracle, An awe struck Kim Jong-Un decided to give the musician another chance to impress him with his music.

He got straight to work, writing another piece of music, this time, his masterpiece.

The night came, and he stood in front of his orchestra as they completely murdered his piece of music.

“It wasn’t supposed to sound anything like that, nothing at all!” he exclaimed, but Kim Jong-Un isn’t the forgiving type and he sent the musician straight to the execution chamber.

Again, the guards asked him what he wanted for his final meal. This time the musician asked for a curry hot enough to burn his eyes out.

He chomped down the curry, teary eyed and sweating, then was strapped to the chair. Again they threw the switch and again the musician remained unaffected.

Dumbfounded, the great leader said, “One last chance to prove your worth”, amazed that this man was actually still alive!

The night of the third composition came, this time it was going to work, “surely this is the most masterful piece of music ever written” thought the musician.

For the third time, the orchestra failed to play the music to how the musician had written it and yet again he was sent to the execution chamber, with Kim Jong-Un himself set to throw the switch.

His final meal request was for the hottest curry ever made on this planet.

“No” said the great leader, I've had it with you and your super hot curries. We’re putting you straight in the chair this time, no final meal, you’re not walking out of here unharmed”

Two weeks later, the Blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, ""We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

So, there was a horse who saw a m**e**tal music video, and he thought the guitarist looked really cool.

 He said to himself ""I want to do that!"" and went to the phone book right away. He found som**e**body advertising electric guitar lessons and called the number.

""Hello, I'd like to learn the el**e**ctric guitar. However, there's a problem. I'm a horse.""


The music instructor replied ""Oh do not worry about that, we have a special program to t**e**ach horses, you'll learn in no time.""
And so the horse went to the music instructor, and to his surprise did learn how to play the electric guitar.


So, he decided he would call his friend the chicken over to show him what he had learned. The chicken comes over, and the horse says, ""I've learned something cool, watch this"" and he plays a lick on his guitar. The chick**e**n is impressed, and the horse decides to show him the video that originally got him interested. The chicken watches it, and is fascinated by the drums. He thinks to himself ""I want to do that!"" So he goes and looks up a music instructor advertising drum lessons and calls the phone number.
""Hello, I'd like to learn the drums. There's one problem though, I'm a chicken.""


The music instructor tells him not to worry about it, they've just developed a special program to teach chickens how to play the drums, and he'll learn in no time. So, the chicken goes to the lessons, and does in fact learn how to play the drums.
He meets back with his friend the horse, and they jam together a little bit. They d**e**cide that if they could get some more of their friends together, they could have a band going. So, they call their friend the cow over, and tell him that they're forming a band and need a bass guitarist. The cow watches the video, and decides it looks like fun and he'll give it a go. He finds an instructor, and calls.


""Hi, I want to learn bass guitar, but I'm a cow. Can you help me?"" ""Sure, that will not be any problem. We have a program d**e**signed specifically to teach cows how to play bass guitar. You'll learn in no time.""


And so, the cow learns bass guitar, and they have a band formed. They were playing in a field when a man walked by. He said to them ""Wow, I like your sound. I'm from a r**e**cord label and I'd like you guys to record an album.""


The animals talk to each other about it and agree that they want to do it. So, they go to the r**e**cording studio and record an album. It became an overnight hit, and they were famous. They decided to start a tour, and set up some dates and locations. Tickets sell out immediately. They're all getting on a plane to head to the first location, when the horse gets a call that his mother is in the hospital. He leaves to go check on her while the rest of the band went ahead, planning to catch up to them once he was finished seeing his mother. He gets there and finds that his mother is dead. He's devastat**e**d. Then he gets a phone call informing him that the plane that his band had gotten on had crashed and there were no survivors. His friends cow and chicken and their manager were all on that plane. 


Everybody he knew was dead, his band was gone, and he d**e**cided to drown his troubles in alcohol.

So the horse walks into a bar, and the bart**e**nder asks, ""Why the long face?""

The father asked, Why did you say goodbye Grandpa?

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. 
He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. 

Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knght with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.
The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.
The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Three Kingdoms,7

The mother, not to be out done, ripped off her robe, jumped on the table. Squatting down, she shit all up in the father's bowl. ""Take that you bastard."" She exclaimed triumphantly. 

Knowing there was no turning back, the father held his nose, glared at the mother, and slurped up the now chunky and stinking cheerios. ""That that you BITCH!"" He shouted across the table.

The boy was in utter disbelief.

""What does it mean?"", I said, and he replied with an exasperated ""I don't even know"".

Years later, and to get home from high school I had to walk past my old primary school. One afternoon I was walking home when two ten year olds come up to me and say ""we know what the worst swear word in the world is"". I asked them what they thought it was, and they replied with ""fuck"". I laughed and said ""that's where you're wrong there fellas"", and when pressed for answers on what the worst swear word was, I told them they'd have to find out for themselves. 

Weeks later, I was in the midst of my final year exams, and this meant I got to finish at lunch time most days. As I was walking home,  I walked past my old school again, and since it was during lunch the oval was full of kids. 

And that's when I heard it. From across an oval full of primary school children, directed straight at me.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",Monks,26

Unfortunately, the going price for a horse at the local auction house was too high so he ended up getting a donkey instead. He decides that, because he has it, he might as well try his luck so he enters it in the horse race and, to his great surprise, it comes in third place.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Preacher's ass shows.""

The preacher was quite pleased with this turn of events, so he decided to enter the donkey in the race again and this time it won.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Preacher's ass out front.""

The bishop was rather unhappy that the church was getting this kind of publicity, so he commanded the preacher to get rid of the donkey.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Bishop scratches preacher's ass.""

After some careful thought, the preacher agreed to give the donkey to a nun in a nearby convent.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Nun has best ass in town.""

This was too much for the bishop. He commanded the nun to get rid of the donkey again. She sold it to a local farmer for the price of $10.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Nun sells ass for $10.""

The bishop fainted. When he regained consciousness, he told the nun to buy the donkey back from the farmer and to then release it into the nearby fields.

The newspaper headline the next day read, ""Nun announces ass is wild and free.""

The bishop was buried the next day.",The Preacher and the Donkey,671
