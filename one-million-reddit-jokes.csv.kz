He needs to go on business for a week. And he fears, knowing all too well that his wife can not resist getting fucked. So like any good husband he sets out to purchase a ""toy"" for her while he is away in order to keep her satisfied, and not have her lusting other men.

He discreetly enters one such shop to provide it. The owner is happy to help, but nothing seems to be adequate enough for the wife. 

""one moment"" the owner says. He goes into the back closet, and returns with a vintage wooden box. He opens it and there is a laminated wooden dildo. 

""so? i don't think that will do the trick"" the man says, but the owner informs him that this is the VOODOO DICK. 

""im happy to show you. VOODOO DICK... the door."" The VDD then floats out of the box and starts mashing the doorknob at the store entrance. ""Then when you want it to stop you say 'VOODOO DICK BACK IN THE BOX."" As soon as he said that it returned to the box.

""Damn ill take it""

So the man leaves it on the dresser with a mushy note right before he left. He told her how to activate it... but he forgot how to tell her how to make it stop. Inevitably she is ready to get plowed and goes to use it.

""VOODOO DICK... muh pussy"" and she gets it on. After a while she cant take anymore, but doesnt know how to stop it. So she puts up with it. later she needs to go to the store, and she is worried about having to drive.

On the way she starts to have another orgasm which causes her to swerve. This caused the police car behind her to pull her over.

""Ma'am you know you were swerving right, have you been drinking?""

""No officer, you dont understand... its... there is this voodoo dick""

""Ha...

Distraught, the man orders a burger and watches the other man longingly. The other man is sitting at a table with a steaming bowl full of vegetable soup, reading a newspaper. The smell fills the room, and antagonizes the hungry patron every moment he's denied his favorite dish.

The man decides enough is enough, so he rushes over to the table and says ""Sir, are you going to eat this soup?"" The other man simply shakes his head ""no"", and without waiting for an explanation the hungry man steals the bowl of soup, rushing back to his table, and begins to devour it hungrily.

He's enjoying every bit of his favorite meal, when he gets to the bottom and notices an old bandaid, complete with a few hairs stuck to the adhesive. Repulsed, the man immediately vomits up all of the soup he'd just eaten into the bowl, when the other man yells to him,

You're an attractive woman, and you see a handsome guy at  a party.  You go up to him and say, ""I'm fantastic in bed.""
 
That's Direct  Marketing.
 

 
You're at a party with a bunch of friends, and see a handsome guy.  One of your friends goes up to him and, starts pointing at you, says, ""She's fantastic in bed.""
 
That's Advertising.
 
 

You see a handsome guy at a party.  You  go up to him and get his telephone number.  The next day you call and say, ""Hi,  I'm fantastic in bed.""
 
That's Telemarketing.
 

 
You see a guy at a party; you straighten your dress.  You walk up to him and pour him a drink.  You say, ""May I?"" and reach up to straighten his tie, brushing your breast lightly against his arm, and then say, ""By the way, I'm  fantastic in bed.""
 
That's Public  Relations.
 
 

You're at a party and see a handsome guy.  He walks up to you and says, ""I hear you're fantastic in bed.""
 
That's Brand  Recognition.
 
 

You're at a party and see a handsome guy.  He fancies you, but you talk him into going home with your friend.

Your friend can't satisfy him, so he calls you.

You're on your way to a party when you realize that there could be handsome men in all these houses you're passing, so you climb onto the roof of one situated towards the center and shout at the top of your lungs, ""I'm fantastic in bed!""
 
That's Facebook.

""See? It doesn't work! You can even test my 4-year-old son!""
So the 4-year-old kid takes the breathalizer test and whaddaya know, it says he's drunk as well. ""As I said it's broken, you should get it checked.""
The policeman is left puzzled, he apologises and lets the man on his way.
As they start driving along again, the man turns to his wife and says: ""You see that? I told you it won't hurt to give the kid a taste.""

Atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known to the Trid race. But there was a problem. There was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the Trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down.

The Trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem, so all they sent was an out-of-work rabbi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted.

The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabbi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down (but not the rabbi). Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together.

The next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the Trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them.

The next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked, ""Monster, why do you only ever kick down the Trids, but always leave me standing?"" To which the monster replied: ""Silly rabbi. Kicks are for Trids.""","On a planet far far away, there lived a race of aliens.",1

She cried until her eyes got swollen because she had doubted  her innocent husband, so she gave him her whole month's salary to  make up for her sin.

post,7qn5li,2qh72,jokes,false,1516052496,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7qn5li/confessions_of_a_heavy_thinker/,self.jokes,,"It started out innocently enough.  I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up.  Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than a social thinker.
	
I began to think alone – “to relax,” I told myself – but I knew it wasn’t true.  Thinking bacme more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.
	
I began to think on the job.  I knew that thinking and employment don’t mix, but I couldn’t stop myself.
	
I began to avoid friend at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka.  I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, “What is it exactly we do here?”
	
I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker.  One day the boss called me in.  He said, “Skip, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem.  If you don’t stop thinking on the job, you’ll have to find another job.”  This gave me a lot to think about.
	
Things weren’t going so great at home either.  One evening I turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life.  She spent the night at her mother’s.
	
I came home early after my conversation with the boss.
“Lambchop,” I confessed, “I’ve been thinking...”
“I know you’ve been thinking,” she said, “and I want a divorce.”
“But honey, surely it’s not that serious.”&gt;	“It is serious,” she said, lower lip aquiver.  “You think as much as college professors, and college professors don’t make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won’t have any money!”
	
“That’s a faulty syllogism,” I said impatiently and she began to cry.  I had enough “I’m going to the library,” I snarled as I stomped out the door.
	
I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio.  I roared into the parking lot and ran up the big glass doors... and they didn’t open.  The library was closed.
	
To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.
	
As I sank to the ground scrabbling at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.  “Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?” it asked.  You probably recognize that line.  It comes from the standard Thinker’s Anonymous poster.
	
Which is why I am here today:  a recovering thinker.  I never miss a TA meeting.  At each meeting we watch a noneducational video; last week it was “Porky’s.”  Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.
	
I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.  Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.

The students' task is to come up with a sentence using the new vocabulary word by the following day. This week the word is ""contagious."" 

So Tuesday morning rolls around and Mrs. Rodgers starts off: ""OK class, who wants to share the sentence they came up with using the word 'contagious'?""

Everyone's hands shoot up. Mrs. Rodgers says ""Oh my goodness, I love the enthusiasm, but we only have time for 3 pupils to share.""

Mrs. Rodgers first calls on Suzy. Suzy responds with the sentence ""My Dad has had the flu for the past week! My mother says not go near him because he is contagious!""
Mrs. Rodgers applauds Suzy and gives her a gold star for the day.

Mrs. Rodgers then says ""OK class, who wants to share next?"" Again everyone's hands shoot up. ""Heather!"" Mrs. Rodgers exclaims, ""why don't you share your sentence with the class?""
Heather responds: ""I went to see the Minion movie last weekend, and this old man kept laughing so loudly, and whenever he laughed, I laughed as well. His laugh was so contagious!""
Mrs. Rodgers applauds Heather and gives her a gold star for the day.

Mrs. Rodgers then states ""OK class, we have time for one more student to share their sentence."" Once again everyone's hand shoots up. Mrs. Rodgers spots little Liam in the back of the classroom raising his hand, and, being a foreign exchange student from Dublin, he had a brogue which made him self conscious of speaking in class. He rarely spoke in class so Mrs. Rodgers jumped at the opportunity for him to participate. Mrs. Rodgers immediately called on little Liam: ""Ah, Liam! What sentence would you like to share with us today?""

Liam responds: ""Oh ya see, me and me father like to go on walks every now and again. Well last week we were going for a walk around our neighborhood, ya see, and we spot this woman. She's painting her picket fence with a beautiful coat of white, but for some reason, she's using this wee little paint brush.

 She was ""only thinking of me,"" she said, and suggested that I go down to the Senior Center and hang out with the fellows.

 I did this and when I got home last night, I decided to play a prank on her. I e-mailed her and told her that I had joined a Parachute Club.

 She replied, ""Are you nuts? You are 86-years-old and now you're going to start jumping out of airplanes?"" 

 I told her that I even got a Membership Card and e-mailed a copy to her. 

 She immediately telephoned me and yelled, ""Good grief, Dad, where are your glasses?! This is a Membership to a Prostitute Club, not a Parachute Club."" 

 ""Oh man, I'm in trouble again,"" I said. ""I really don't know what to do. I signed up for five jumps a week!!""

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.,740

The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" ""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" ""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? ""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs. 

The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but for Pete's sake, stop using my ass for a scoreboard!""",Visiting a friend,11

Steve: That’s great. How’s that even possible?

James: Its definitely possible. Never doing it again tho.

One day during the Gulf War, an Iraqi general and his army were patrolling through semi-mountainous terrain. Suddenly, over one of the hills they hear a soldier.

""One American soldier can take out 10 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general smirks, then sends 10 of his soldiers over the hill. A brief firefight ensues, and then everything goes quiet...

""One American soldier can take out 100 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general is rightfully impressed, so he laughs and sends 100 of his soldiers over the hill to finish the job. A large battle is heard over the hill that lasts much longer than the previous fight. Finally, everything calms down...

""One American soldier can take out 1000 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general is furious, and sends over 1000 of his best soldiers. A massive and lengthy battle takes place over the hill. During the fight, a wounded Iraqi soldier comes crawling back over the hill toward the general.

As he approaches the eighth hole, he hits the ball and slices it pretty hard to the right. Grumbling, he walks out, deep past the weeds and into the tall grass of the surrounding forest, where he stumbles across a sleeping leprechaun. He nudges the leprechaun awake and, startled, it says to him ""Ah bollocks, I thought I was far enough off the course that nobody would find me. Well, rules are rules: you've found me, so I will now grant you one wish.""

The man thinks for a moment and replies ""You know, I've always wanted to be the greatest amateur golfer in the world.""

The leprechaun grins and says  ""All right, I can do that for you, but there's a wee bit of a catch, you see. Your sex life is going to take a turn for the worse."" The man shrugs and says ""Okay,"" so the leprechaun winks, taps his nose, and spins around before vanishing in a cloud of green smoke.

Not quite sure what just happened, the man blinks slowly and then pulls out his 4 iron and lines up the next shot. He takes a swing and when the golf ball lands, he is astonished to see it on the green a few feet from the hole. He sinks it in a single shot with his putter to make par. On the ninth hole, he swings his driver and the golf ball flies straight down the middle of the fairway, again landing directly on the green. With mounting excitement, the golfer finishes the back nine, playing the best golf of his life. The very next day, he enters an amateur tournament at the local club, and comes in first place by a considerable margin. Emboldened, he starts entering competitions at other courses further away, and within a couple of months, he has become the best amateur golfer in the world.

About a year later, the man is playing a round alone on his old public course. Approaching the eighth hole, he swings and slices the ball hard to the right. ""Huh, it's been a while since that's happened,"" he remarks to himself. Once again, he tramps out deep past the weeds and into the tall grass of the surrounding forest, where he sees his ball has come to rest beside the leprechaun's foot. The leprechaun greets him and asks him how he has been. The golfer says ""Thank you so much for granting my wish; my life has been wonderful since then. I'm now the greatest amateur golfer in the world.""

""Well, what about your sex life?"" asks the leprechaun.

""Oh, great, just great. I really can't complain.""

Puzzled, the leprechaun asks ""How many times have you had sex in the last year?""

The golfer says ""Well, two, maybe three times?""

The leprechaun laughs uproariously and says ""You've had sex three times in the last year and still think your sex life is great?""

""Well, for a priest in a small town in Ireland, I think I'm doing pretty well.""",A man out golfing meets a leprechaun [Long],39

In the dark of night, a bear attacked their tent. They dashed through the woods in an attempt to flee, but they couldn't escape before the bear ate the Czech boy.

The Jewish boy kept on running, until​ he found the park ranger who asked, ""What's wrong?""

""My Czech friend and I were out camping when we were attacked by a bear,"" he explained. The ranger says ""there are only two bears in this forest. If I can track them down, will you know which one ate your friend?""

""Yes, I'll know - I'll never forget the look of the bear that ate him""

So the ranger set off, and after some time he has found the two bears. ""Alright then. There's a male bear, and a female bear here... Which one ate your friend?""

The Jewish boy says, ""That one - the male bear. It was definitely the male bear.""

The ranger proceeds to shoot the bear, but his friend isn't inside. 

I guess you should never trust a Jew when they say the Czech is in the mail.

As she is admiring her new purchase, she notices that bus number 5 passes her house, and as it does, the cabinet doors open up.  ""That's strange,"" she thinks to herself, as she closes the cabinet doors.  After some minutes, bus number 5 passes her house again, and as happened the first time, the cabinet doors open wide.  

Confused, the woman calls the cabinet maker and asks him to come to her house.  The cabinet maker arrives at the house and asks the woman about the exact issue she is having.  She explains, ""every time bus number 5 passes the front of my house, the doors on the cabinet open up.""

The cabinet maker has been building cabinets for more than 30 years and he's never heard of such a thing.  Just then, bus number 5 passes the house, and the cabinet doors spring open.  Amazed, the cabinet maker takes some tools, and start adjusting the hinges and looking around the edges of the doors for some clues.  A few moments later, bus number 5 passes again, and once again, the doors spring open.  

Completely clueless, the cabinet maker tells the woman, ""even though it is a small cabinet, I'm going to climb inside and do some adjustments and then wait for bus number 5 to pass again to see if I can figure this out from the inside.""  He contorts his body, climbs in and asks the woman to close the cabinet doors.

Just then, the woman's husband arrives home. He enters the house and admires the new cabinet.  He opens the doors and finds the cabinet maker inside.  

""What are you doing in there?"" asks the husband.

The cabinet maker responds, ""If I told you I was waiting for bus number 5, would you believe me?""",The cabinet maker,76

was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he
replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to
be cold and that the members of the village should collect
firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got
an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National
Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to
be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told
them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,
""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The
Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to
collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going
to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of
the coldest winters ever.""

The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Mercedes Benz SL 500.

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank, she has the title and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car collateral for the loan.

The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blond for using a $110,000 Benz as collateral against a $5,000 loan.

An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Benz into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.

The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire.

What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.",I recall my first time buying condoms,23

They were brothers and from the time they were born they loved to race more than they loved anything else. Hook'm was bigger and faster, but Snook'm was always close behind. From sunup to sundown, the brothers would race around the plains, with Hook'm always in front, taunting Snook'm.
""You can't catch me! You can't catch me!"" Hook'm would always yell. They dreamed of being race horses, flying around a track with crowds cheering their names, just like in the stories the older horses would tell them. Hook'm would listen to the roar of the wind on summer days and close his eyes, pretending it was his audience roaring with excitement.

One afternoon, two cowboys came across the horses racing across the field; Hook'm tearing through the tall grass, with Snook'm close behind.

""Well I reckon them's about the fastest horses I ever done seen."" The cowboy said. 

""Well I do declare you may be right,"" his partner agreed.

The next morning, the cowboys left out some carrots and hid behind a bush. Hook'm and Snook'm went straight for the carrots and the cowboys lasso'd them and lead them to a truck. They took the horses to a racetrack in Kentucky to show off what they had found.

The horses woke up in the stable and peered over the walls. ""Snook'm! Come look at this!"" Hook'm said. ""There's a racetrack here! Just like we heard about growing up!"" 

At that moment, the cowboys came to the stable door, with the racetrack owner behind them. They opened the door and the horses immediately took off around the track. Hook'm tore out of the gate and Snook'm followed. The racetrack owner stood in awe of how fast these horses ran. He offered the cowboys a handsome sum for the horses, which the cowboys gladly took. 

The next day the horses were set to debut. Two jockeys climbed on top of the horses and lined up in the starting line. When the race started, Hook'm and Snook'm were off, kicking up dust around the track, at least 10 yards ahead of the next fastest horse. The crowd was speechless watching these horses tear around the track; Hook'm handily in front and Snook'm following behind.

Every weekend a larger crowd would gather to watch these horses, lining up early in the morning to get a spot out front to see Hook'm and Snook'm. Hook'm was the favorite; he was the fastest horse anyone had ever seen. But Snook'm had his fans as well, and people loved to watch the two horses run. 

Snook'm loved racing, but Hook'm loved winning. After each race Hook'm trotted up to the winner's circle with his head high and a colorful wreath of flowers draped around his neck, while the jockeys popped bottles of champagne and showered each other and the horses in the spray.

After a while, Hook'm began to develop a taste for the champagne. He would sneak out at night and take bottles back to his stable during the week. He started drinking earlier and earlier in the day, and later and later into the night. Snook'm began to notice that Hook'm was stumbling in races, weaving back and forth and panting heavily when he finished. 

One night when Hook'm was drinking, Snook'm snuck into his room. There he found Hook'm leaning against the wall, surrounded by empty bottles. ""Hook'm! What are you doing, man? Look at yourself!"" Hook'm stumbled to his feet.

""Hey! I can drink all I want okay? I'm the winner, and the winner gets what he wants! So why don't you get off my back, okay?""

""Hook'm, we have a race tomorrow! You can't run like this, you're piss drunk! You'll have a heart attack!""

""Well then you'd win and that's what you wanted, huh? To beat me? Well too fucking bad, Snook'm, cause tomorrow I'm gonna beat you, just like every other time.""

Hook'm kicked a bottle into the wall and stormed at Snook'm, eyes red with fury. Snook'm ran away in tears, back to the safety of his room. He was worried about Hook'm, but he couldn't seem to help him.

The next morning the crowds were lined up around the stadium. People were excited to come see Hook'm win his first championship. When the horses lined up at the starting gates, Snook'm saw that Hook'm was still drunk from the night before. His face was pale and his knees wobbled as he lined up to the gate. 

The gun went off and Hook'm tore out of the gate like a rocket, legs pumping and nostrils flaring. Snook'm followed with the rest of the horses at a steady pace. The race was 10 laps, and Snook'm knew to pace himself.

By lap 5, Hook'm was halfway across the track, weaving and huffing and pumping along, but he started to waver. His knees were burning and the jockey felt like a ton of bricks on his aching back. Snook'm lead the rest of the pack, slowly gaining on Hook'm.

Laps 6 and 7 Snook'm drew closer. By lap 8 Hook'm was really struggling to keep his lead. Snook'm was gaining on him with every lap. As Hook'm crossed the line of the 8th lap, his front legs gave out and he stumbled into the side wall. Snook'm was closing in on him and Hook'm was having to weave back and forth to stay in front. The crowd was roaring. They had neer seen a race so intense. 

As the flag waved for the final lap, Snook'm was nose to tail with Hook'm. He had never been this close to victory, to validation, to glory. As they turned the final corner Snook'm came nose to nose with Hook'm. He saw that Hookm's face, now ghost white, his eyes focused only on the finish line. In the final stretch, it happened. Hook'ms legs gave out from under him and he crashed into the ground. Snook'm flew across the finish line, just as fast as he had started. The crowd went wild, throwing flowers at Snook'm, screaming and chanting his name. 

""Snook'm! Snook'm! Snook'm!""

But Snook'm looked back and saw Hook'm on the ground, not moving. A silence spread through the audience as they began to notice the motionless horse on the racetrack. EMTs surrounded Hook'm. ""He's not breathing!"" One of them said. 

Snook'm approached catiously, staring at his brother's cold body in the dirt. He drew up to Hook'ms face, and he didn't see the fury or anger that he had seen just moments ago. He saw only his brother, who he had grown up with in the plains of Wyoming, the face that would laugh and taunt at him while they bounded through the tall grass. 

""Wow..."" Snook'm whispered. ""He would rather die than let me win...""

The EMT looked up at Snook'm and Snook'm looked back. The EMTs face was wraught with worry as he focused on Snook'm and said:

""Holy shit a talking horse!""","The story of Hook'm and Snook'm, the fastest horses you've ever seen [LONG]",27
