ur money where your mouth is!?!"" Oscar shouted at Harold.

""Wh..wha..what do you have in mind?"" Harold asked, sounding as though he might cry from getting chastised.

When Oscar saw how his friend had deflated, he immediately felt an immense guilt, because after all; this whole trip had been him trying to do something nice for his friend. And so a plan formed in his mind.

""Look Harold,"" began Oscar with sincerity, ""I'm very sorry for getting angry with you, but the idea of a race does sound like fun, what do you say?""

Harold; who was very happy that his friend was not actually angry with him, perked up immediately.

""Sure Oscar!"" He exclaimed, ""what where you thinking?""

""Do you see that oak in the distance?"" Inquired Oscar, pointing with his wing at the largest tree in the Forrest

""The really big one?""

""That's the one, what do you say we see who can get there faster?""

This excited Harold a great deal, because as far as he knew, he was the fastest animal in the woods, but he also knew in his heart of hearts that Oscar; with his ability to fly; would probably easily beat him to the tree.

""Sure oscar!""

And so they lined up facing the tree in the distance. Harold started stretching while Oscar began to flap his wings, warming up before they  got started. But soon both were ready.

""Alright Harold, on your mark,"" began Oscar, observing his friend tensing up so as to get a good fast start. ""Get set... GO!""

Harold took off like a bolt of lighting, keeping hos body low to the ground while his legs pumped underneath him, seemingly with a mind of their own.

Oscar on the other hand took off lazily into the sky, determined to let his friend win.

'I'll stay close to him, so that when we reach the tree he'll think it was a really close race!' Oscar thought to himself.

Meanwhile Harold had no thoughts, for he was so focused on the tree in the distance as he zipped around trees and over rocks in the path.

Suddenly as Harold rounded a corner, he realized much too late that the path had been washed out by rain since last he had been in this part of the Forrest.

His paws skittered helplessly in a ill-fated attempt to stop, but it was no good; Harold tumbled head over heels into the ditch.

""HAROLD!"" Cried Oscar desperately, ""Harold are you all right!?!""

But there was no response. Horribly frightened, Oscar flew down into the ditch; where he found his friend sprawled our on the ground.

""Harold?"" Oscar asked quietly, suddenly even more afraid for his friend.

Harold suddenly groaned, and stretched painfully. He felt where he had hit every rock and root on the way down, but amazingly he felt mostly okay.

""It's okay Oscar, I think I'm fine!"" He said loudly as he was getting up. But as he stood up, he couldn't see  Oscar anywhere.

""Oscar?"" Harold Called loudly.
But there was no sign of him.
Because no harm, No fowl.",Oscar and Harold.,2

She met the Devil who was really a nice guy and she was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found God waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,"" he said. So she spent the next 24 hours around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and God came and got her. ""So, you've spent a day in hell and in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,"" The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.""

When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.

On the day of the competition, the three teams gathered outside Tongass National Forest in Alaska, alongside a few thousand cheering fans. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres opened the envelope containing the challenge and read it aloud: ""Go in the forest and find a rabbit. The first team to return with a rabbit wins."" 

Everyone knew it was a tough challenge, because rabbits are very rare in the region. Nevertheless, the three teams rushed into the forest.

The American detectives quickly called up NASA, and asked them to use their satellites to find a rabbit in the 16.7 million acres park. After a few minutes, NASA sent the coordinates of the nearest rabbit enclave and the Americans quickly retrieved the rabbit in barely an hour. Guterres announced them as the winner. 

Jubilation all around, and Trump went on a tweeting spree after he heard the result.
The Chinese People's Armed Police Force, meanwhile, contacted the Ministry of State Security, the Chinese spy agency, and the latter hacked into the phones and emails of the American cops. After obtaining the coordinates from NASA, they too went for the same rabbit enclave and returned with a rabbit in two hours. Upon hearing the result, President Xi Jinping organized a military parade in Beijing to commemorate their second-placed finish.

Since the winners were known, everyone wanted to go home then, but they had to wait for the Russian team, which still hadn't returned. Just before they were about to break for lunch, they suddenly heard loud noises from the forest. After a few minutes, they could see a polar bear running towards them yelling, ""Yes, Yes, I'm a rabbit,"" even as five Russian politsiyas continue beating the polar bear with a rubber hose.

He’s fairly young and very nervous, but seeing his distress, Father Todd the elderly priest he’s replacing was very thoughtful and had prepared some cheat sheets so everything would transition smoothly. Hidden behind the altar was the order of prayers for the mass. Behind the pew out of view was a list of psalms and subjects he could talk about in his sermon without getting lost - he had thought of everything. 

After getting through his first mass with the help of the cheat sheets, Father Ben stepped into take his first confessions. First up was a young man.

“Forgive me father for I have sinned - I have had impure thoughts”. 

Father Ben looks at his cheat sheet taped to the wall of the confessional - impure thoughts - 5 Hail Mary’s and 10 Our Fathers. 

“Right my son, say five Hail Mary’s and ten Our Fathers and all is forgiven.”

“Thank you father...” the young man replies and leaves.

Feeling more confident, Father Ben looks up as an old woman entered the booth.

“Forgive me father for I have sinned, I have committed the sin of jealousy. Our neighbours have a new kitchen and I wish ours could be renovated”

Again Father Ben consults the list. Jealousy - 10 Our Fathers.

“Say the Lord’s Prayer ten times and go with god my child” he says confidentially and the woman smiles and leaves the booth.

Then an attractive young woman slips into the booth. She is very shy and bashful and seems very uncomfortable.

“Forgive me Father for I have sinned, I have committed fellatio, out of wedlock, many times and on many men.”

Father Ben is taken back by the confession but composes himself and consults his cheat sheet. He is suddenly overcome with horror - fellatio isn’t on the list. He checks the list again and then around his booth to see if there is another scrap of paper but to no avail. Meanwhile the girl is looking more upset with his lack of response as she sits in silence and waits for his answer.

In a panic he sticks his head out of the booth and sees a choir boy standing nearby the altar.

“Psssst, hey what does Father Todd normally give for fellatio?” He whispers hurriedly.

The choir boy whispers back:

“Normally a mars bar, a can of Coke and a pat on the head...”",A newly anointed priest is given his first posting.,14

""Good grief, did you see that?"" she asks her husband. He hadn’t, so she asks him to look in the pot. He reaches for it and again the lid rises, and he sees two little eyes looking around before it slams down..

Rather perturbed, he calls the waiter over, explains what is happening, and demands an explanation.

One day, as they slowly drove down the freeway, she remarked about his slow-driving habits. ""I can't stand it anymore,"" she told him. ""Let's play a game.. For every 5 miles per hour over the speed limit [60 MPH] you drive, I'll remove one piece of clothing."" 

He enthusiastically agreed and sped up the car. He reached the 65 MPH mark, so she took off her blouse. At 70 off came the pants. At 75 it was her bra and At 80 her panties. Now seeing her naked for the first time...and traveling faster than he ever had before...he became very excited and lost control of the car.

He veered off the road, went over an embankment and hit a tree! His girlfriend was not hurt, but he was trapped. She tried to pull him free but alas he was stuck. 

""Go to the road and get help,"" he said. ""I don't have anything to cover myself with!"" she replied. 

The man felt around, but could only reach one of his shoes. ""You'll have to put this between your legs to cover it up,"" he told her. So she did as he said and went up to the road for help. 

Along came a truck driver. Seeing a naked, crying woman along the road, he pulled over to hear her story. ""My boyfriend! My boyfriend!"" she sobs, ""He's stuck and I can't pull him out!"" 

The truck driver looking down at the shoe between her legs replied, ""Ma'am,

Everything was perfect, except for one thing. Over the years this bachelor parrot had become extremely randy and had started to fuck the highly prized ducks, much to the dismay and annoyance of his owners.

One day, when the parrot had fucked yet another one of his ducks, Lord Earlstone had had enough. ""I'm warning you,"" he remonstrated with the parrot, ""one more time and I will pluck all the feathers off your head!"" This frightened the parrot, so he tried his best to control his natural urges. 

But it was no use. A few weeks later he could control himself no more and he fucked another of the prized ducks. Lord Earlstone was furious and, true to his word, plucked every last feather off the parrot's head rendering him completely bald. 

A few days later Lord and Lady Earlstone were hosting a party. In keeping with years of tradition, they had the parrot sit on its perch at the entrance to the hall and direct the ladies and gentlemen to their proper places. As the guests filed by the parrot would announce, ""Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right."" 

And so it went that evening as the parrot went about his duties. ""Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right. Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right.""

While performing this task the parrot happened to look further down the line and noticed a bald man slowly making his way forward. 

Keeping a beady eye on the approaching bald man the parrot continued, ""Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right. Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right. Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right. ""

When the bald man eventually reached the parrot, the parrot announced, ""Ladies to the left, gentlemen to the right. Duck fuckers, get in line behind me!""",The Randy Parrot,3

""Those, son,"" he explains to me, ""look to be smoke signals. You see, before telephones, TVs, and even mail, the Native American people used smoke signals to communicate over long distances. On a clear day like today, you can see it's highly effective.""

Impressed with his wisdom, I needed to know more. ""What does it say?""

""Let's see..."" My father furrowed his brow and looked off into the distance. He stared with intensity, saying nothing, only occasionally nodding or making an affirming hum. Whole minutes passed, and I grew impatient. Surely the message wasn't THAT complex!

""What does it say?"" I begged.

""Son, hold on, please!"" He was deep in thought, interpreting the smoke signals, and my interruption was inconvenient but had not broken his focus. Minutes more passed, each feeling longer than the last, and finally he gave a solid nod. ""Ah, I see,"" he proclaimed.

She doesn’t believe him but drops it on the counter anyway. He says, “That’s a 6-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404 reel and 10-pound test line. It’s a good all-around combination, and it’s on sale this week for only $20.”

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

The husband cringed and said, “I told you to watch out for the houses. Lets go apologize, and see how much this is going to cost.”

They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, “Come in.”

They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer. A man sitting on the couch said, “Are you the people that broke that window?”

“Yes, sorry about that,” the husband replied.

“No actually I want to thank you. I’m a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. You released me. I’m allowed to grant three wishes. I’ll give you each one wish and keep one for myself.”

“OK, great!” the husband said. “I want a million dollars a year for life.”

“No problem, its the least I could do. And you, what do you want?” the genie said, looking at the wife.

“I want a house in every country in the world,” said the wife.

“Consider it done,” the genie replied.

“And what is your wish, genie?” the husband asked.

“Well since I have been trapped in that bottle, I haven’t had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife.”

When she went to look for it she found a frog in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes.""

The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, ""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to.""

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 


One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time, in a magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",973

He lived across from a neighbour who was a nun. She was notorious for scamming elderly people for church donations which she pocketed, but otherwise didn’t speak to him, so he kept his distance. 

One day, he realised he had created potentially the most decadent dish to have existed in the history of dishes. Gordon Ramsay would quit his career as a chef if he tasted this wonderful, exquisite masterpiece. It had all the right flavorsome notes: rosemary, garlic, ginger and a slight fruity taste. 

But there was one problem: he couldn’t figure out what he was missing. There was just one secret ingredient he needed, but he wasn’t sure what. 

He travelled to the coast of turkey and started his own organic sage farm. After six months, the farm had flourished into a successful business. He added the sage to his signature dish, but alas, it was not to be.

In his disappointment, he shut down the farm and killed its workers by running them over with a tractor.

One worker, however, survived, revealing another ingredient that could be used.

“I promise you, find the ears of three cows raised by Dutch virgins in the Vaalserberg mountain range. They will be hidden in a cave away from the public eye, and they are the most sought after cows in the world.”

The chef spent years and years cultivating a friendship with these virgins. He won their trust, and eventually, they revealed the location of the beloved cows.

He experimented with the cows ears: smoking them with the ashes of cedarwood, slow roasting them in a state-of-the-art oven, having them kissed by the lips of Victoria’s Secret Angels.

The dish looked magical. Delicious, crispy morsels of cow scattered on a bed of creamy pasta sprinkled with chives. In anticipation, the chef licked his lips. Slowly, he brought a spoon to his mouth, but a moment later, he fainted.

“Disgusting!” He screamed as soon as he had awoken. In his rage, he killed the Dutch virgins. He burned down the forests and killed the Victoria’s Secret Angels.

The following day, he awoke to incessant knocking on his door. Drained of energy, he begrudgingly opened the door to find his evil neighbour.

“Good morning,” she said in a hoarse voice.

“What do you want?” he snapped.

“I came to offer you an ingredient I grow in my home. And free of charge.”

“Why should I listen to you? I’ve spent millions of dollars trying to track down an ingredient. What makes you think whatever free pot plant you’ve got is going to help?”

She shrugged. “It’s up to you. I will return at 7pm with the secret ingredient. It must be cooked in your kitchen.”

At 7pm, after hours of indecision, the chef gave in and let the nun into his house. 

She unwrapped the secret ingredient as the chef waited with bated breath. 

But it was just thyme.

“Thyme? THYME?! You think whatever store bought thyme is going to cut it?” he yelled. 

The nun shook her head. “Go on, try it.”

He started up his stove and dumped the thyme into a pan and drizzled it with extra virgin olive oil. 

But after waiting for half an hour, the thyme wasn’t cooking. The oil hadn’t even warmed up. 

Infuriated, he pulled out his biggest butcher knife and killed the nun.

Miraculously, the oil began to sizzle. And then it happened.

The thyme released a fragrance akin to Johnny Depp’s body odor combined with the teardrops of Jesus. It was beyond heavenly. And the chef had finally completed his dream of mastering the best pasta dish in the world.

The moral of the story: thyme fries when you’re stabbing nuns.

After a couple of holes, the man gets his in the genitalia by a rogue golf ball.  Wanting to make sure everything is OK, he goes to a doctor.  He asks the doctor, ""I'm getting married in a week and my fiance is a virgin.  Will I be able to give her a proper wedding night?""  

The doctor replies, ""You should be fine by then, but I'll give you a splint just to be sure.""

So the doctor grabs four tongue depressors, puts them on the man's Johnson, and sends him on his way.  

On his wedding night, the man's wife comes to him in some fancy lingerie and the man is speechless.  His wife looks amazing, and he can't stop looking at her breasts.  She notices, pushes her bosom together, and says flirtatiously, ""No man has touched these before.""

The man drops his pants and replies, ""That's nothing!  Mine is still in the original box!""

About an hour later, the rabbi had grown somewhat tired of fishing, and chose to join the priest back on land. He too stepped out of the boat and walked to shore.

Upon witnessing these apparent miracles, the minister said to himself: ""Surely, if the priest and rabbi possess sufficient faith to walk on water, then I must as well."" Having become convinced of this apparent fact, he stood up, stepped out of the boat, and promptly fell into the lake.

Observing the minister's mishap from the beach, the rabbi turned to priest and said: ""Do you think we should have told him about the rocks?""","A priest, a minister, and a rabbi all go fishing...",17

As they’re leaving the horse asks the donkey to join him for a nightcap at his place and the donkey jumps at the chance.

As soon as the donkey walks into the horses place he’s surrounded by pictures, newspaper cut out and trophies. 

The donkey asks ‘where did you get this stuff from?’ 

The race horse replies ‘well these are from my history as one of the greatest horses to ever race. I have one the gold cup three times, the grand national twice and much much more.’

The donkey is shocked that such a successful race horse would be friends with such a sad and lonely donkey but they have a great time and agree to meet at the donkeys house the following day.

On the walk home the donkey wonders what he can do to impress the amazing race horse as he doesn’t want to lose face admitting that all he does is carry kids around the beach. He has a great idea so goes to the beach and takes a photo of his mate, who happens to be a zebra. He gets the photo blown up and hangs it on full display in his living room.

The following day the horse comes around and instantly mentions the picture.

‘So what’s this picture? It looks very impressive’ says the horse
