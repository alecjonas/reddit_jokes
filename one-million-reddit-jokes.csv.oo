A young man in the 6th grade was constantly finding himself in trouble at school; bullying, fighting, being disruptive. This is Johnny Deeper. 

One morning while in class, another student walked by Johnny's desk and accidentally bumped into it. 

""Nigga I know you ain't bumpin' into my desk!"" Exclaimed Johnny, as he slapped the boy upside the head. They proceeded to get into a scuffle right in the classroom, knocking over a few desks in the process. 

""Johnny Deeper! Go to the principals office immediately!"" The teacher cried desperately. 

He waited outside the office for a few minutes. The principal; a mid-thirties, brown haired, Sarah Palin-esque woman with a black power suit jacket and skirt that was probably too high for this environment but fuck it, it's part of the joke. 

They sat down in her office. 

""Johnny, I've heard you're disruptions are becoming hazardous to your classmates. What was the reason this time?""

""I ain't sayin' shit."" Mumbled Lil John. 

""Johnny, please. We need to assess the problem properly. ""

""I ain't *sayin'* shit. "" he repeated. 

She paused for a moment. 

""There must be a way to solve this.""

""Maybe if you take off dat shirt we could figure something out.""

""Johnny! I would never-""

He cuts her off. ""Hey lady, if you don't! Imma tell my Daddy you're the reason I got these bruises today!"" 

She pauses again. 

""Fine""

She removes her jacket. 

""*Now can we talk?*""

""Nah, not yet. You gonna have to take da rest off too."" 

""Not a chance, Johnny that would violate so many rules and laws. ""

""So does child abuse, so get naked bitch or else imma tell my mom. ""

Shocked and appalled, she realized her career was hanging in the balance, and Johnny Deeper was pushing it closer to the edge. She obliged. 

As she stood there in front of him, she sighs, ""Now tell me, Johnny.""

""*Alright, alright,* but first. I have one final request."" He retorted. 

Knowing the situation couldn't really get much worse, she agreed. 

""What?""

""You have to let me stick my finger in your belly button. ""

""Johnny that's ridiculous!"" But she realized it could have been way worse request, so she agrees again. 

""Close your eyes."" He said. 

....... 

""**JOHNNY! That is not my belly button!**"" 

And he says, 

""Well baby, *that's not my finger either.*""

They arrive at the gates of heaven, and after a minute, Saint Peter appears before them. Saint Peter says, ""Boys, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have died in a horrible car accident. We would love to welcome you into heaven, but you first must pass one simple test. If you pass, you will be admitted to heaven forever, but if you fail, I'm going to press this big red button over here, and you will automatically be dropped into hell for all eternity. Who would like to go first?""


The first guy walks up. Saint Peter says, ""Okay, son. Tell me the story of Easter."" The guy scratches his head for a moment and then replies, ""Easter? Oh yeah... I know the story of Easter! That's the one about the big fat guy in a red suit who flies around, dropping off presents for kids, and he eats a bunch of cookies and stuff, right?"" Saint Peter replies, ""Uhh, no. That is NOT the story of Easter."" He presses the big red button, and the guy goes to hell.


The second guy walks up. Saint Peter again says, ""Okay, son. Tell me the story of Easter."" The second guy thinks for a minute and says, ""Easter! Oh yeah. I friggin' LOVE Easter. That's the one where the Pilgrims and the Indians got together and ate turkey and mashed potatoes with gravy and cranberry sauce... mmm mmm. Easter!"" Saint Peter shakes his head in disgust, hits the red button and the guy goes down to hell. 


The last guy approaches. Saint Peter, somewhat irritated says, ""OKAY, son. Tell me the story of Easter."" The guy replies, ""Easter... Easter... yeah I know that one. That's the one with Jesus right? He gets like crucified on a cross, and after he died, his friends came and got his body... put it in a cave and sealed it up with a big rock, right??"" Saint Peter exclaimed, ""YES! Phew! Okay, son. You can come into heaven.""


So the two of them walk through the gates of heaven where there is a long path up to the main area. On this walk, Saint Peter decides to chit chat with the new guy. ""That Easter story is pretty great, isn't it?"" The guy replies, ""Oh yeah! It was a miracle! You know what my FAVORITE part of that story is? It's when Jesus' friends come back to the cave, and they find the rock has been rolled away, and then Jesus comes WALKING out of the cave... and he looks down and sees his shadow, and it means there's six more weeks of Winter!""

He decided that he must find a husband for his daughter. This man, who would one day take the throne, had to be the bravest and fiercest warrior in all the land. 

The king devised a test. his engineers immediately began work on a massive pit filled with horrors. 

On the day of reckoning, hundreds of brave men travelled from all the corners of the kingdom to prove their worth. They stood crowded at the edges of the pit waiting for the event to begin. 

The king stood with the princess on the far side of the pit and addressed the crowd.

""Men. I seek the bravest and fiercest warrior to take my daughter's hand in marriage. To do so, simply cross this pit from that side to this and take her hand in yours. Additionally, I will...""

Before the king could finish, one of the warriors went straight into the pit and into a pool of black water. The crowd roared with excitement. 

Starving crocodiles, imported from the Nile, immediately swarmed him. After a furious churning of blood and black water the warrior emerged. 

As he advanced, a swinging pendulum missed his face by a hair. The warrior ducked, dodged, and rolled past flying arrows, battering rams, spinning swords, and spouts of fire. 

The warrior was halfway through the pit when the lions pounced on him. The warrior was quick. He blinded them with mud and lured them into attacking each other. Some he killed with his bare hands. 

A few steps later, a giant swung his massive club with a thunderous shout. The crowd watched in amazement as the warrior slowly wore out the giant and broke him down by steadily pelting stones at his head. 

Finally, at long last, the giant fell. 

The warrior slowly climbed out the far side of the pit, beaten and bloodied. He took the fair princess' hand in his. 

""I am truly amazed"" exclaimed the king. 

""You went into my pit with no hesitation and have valiantly survived every obstacle. You are truly the rightful heir to my throne. However, you likely did not hear the rest of my proposal"" said the king. 

""Whoever survives the pit will not only take my daughter's hand in marriage, but may also make any request of the king that is in my power to grant. So, do you have a request, brave warrior?""

""Yes"" said the warrior.

""Well, what does it take to become a Hebbernous monk?""

The monk replied: ""First, you have to memorize the whole bible.""

The journalist went back home and spent one month memorizing every verse of the bible. Then, he went back to the abbey.

""Here's a complete video of me reciting the bible.""

""Great job."" The monk said. ""Now, you have to build ten monasteries in ten different countries. Don't worry, our generous abbey will pay for you.""

""Uhm... Okay, deal""

Two months have passed and ten monasteries were indeed built in ten different countries. The next day, the journalist went back to the abbey.

""Am I a monk now?""

""Not yet. You have to help 1,000 families in Africa by finding them a home and a steady income.""

""DAM- I mean, yeah, piece of cake.""

It took the journalist three months to help all the families. Exhausted, he rushed back to the abbey.

""Tell me, am I finally a monk?!""

His friend offered,   ""Don't do that.   There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker an cheaper than a doctor.   Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it.   It only costs $10.""

Bill figured he had nothing to lose,   so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store.   Finding the computer,   he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.   The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.   After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:   You have tennis elbow.   Soak your arm in warm water.   Avoid heavy lifting.   It will be better in two weeks.

Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever,   he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.   He decided to give it a try.   He mixed together some tap water,   a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.   To top it off,   he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store,   located the machine,   poured in the sample and deposited the $10.   The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

Your tap water is too hard - Get a water softener.   Your dog has worms - Get him vitamins.   Your daughter is using cocaine.   - Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.   Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.   - They aren't yours.   - Get a lawyer.   And if you don't stop jerking off,   your tennis elbow will never get better",Computer Diagnosis,123

Startled, the man responded, “Hell, I didn't know! Hey, aren’t you supposed to give me three wishes?”

“Well then, I wish for a million bucks,” the man said without hesitation.

Astonished, the man yelled over the clamor, “Hey, I wished for a million bucks, why would you give me a million ducks instead?”

He joined the group led by a pregnant woman named Scarlett, who herself had limited the booze to ensure the baby's good health. He makes lots of progress in a short amount of time and eventually cures himself of the booze completely, making a lot of friends along the way and getting his life back on track while enjoying the occasional cold one.

Scarlett, still leading the group, decided to take the remaining alcoholics to a bar to see who had the willpower to cut themselves off and work from there. However, at the last second, her water broke and she was rushed to the hospital. Not wanting to deny the alcoholics a chance to recover (who knows how long she could be in maternity leave for?) she called up Eminem to take over, who gladly agreed.

Eminem rented out two vans and had his friend drive the other one to a local bar, both vans filled with the same recovering alcoholics. They filed out and got into the bar. But before they could do so, Eminem called for their attention.

He reached a cloud, upon which was sitting a rather plump and very ugly woman.

No contest, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud. On this cloud was a slightly thinner woman, who was slightly easier on the eye.

""Screw me hard or climb the ladder to success,"" she said.

""Well,"" thought the man, ""might as well carry on.""

On the next cloud was an even more attractive lady who, this time, was quite attractive.

""Screw me now or climb the ladder to success,"" she fluttered.

As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went. On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, the lot.

""Fuck me or climb the ladder to success,"" she flirted.

Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again. When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400-pound ugly man, armpit hair showing, flies buzzing around his head.

I sat on near the window, while Ryan sat in the middle and Daniel sat on the side. We always wondered what London, so we decided that it was time to take a trip to London. The plane suddenly flew off. We all fell shortly afterwards, since it was near 10:00pm. The next day, we woke up peacefully. I looked at the time at my phone, when I noticed the most peculiar thing: the time was all messed up. Instead of showing numbers, there was questions marks. Out of confusion, I asked to look at Daniel’s and Ryan’s phones. They also had the same problem. I asked out loud if anyone knew what time it was. However, no one seemed to know. There started a loud murmur amongst the plane, until it landed.
	We were getting concerned. All around us, people didn’t know the time. Even on the news, people had no idea what the time was. All clocks and timers were gone. What was happening, and how could we fix it? Suddenly, I had an idea. We could see the Big Ben. We drove a taxi there in about 10 minutes. However, I couldn’t see it, when I noticed that there was a huge hole in the ground. It had… disappeared. Did anyone know what was going on? Apparently not. That night, people from all over the world didn’t know time it was. Would that mean that we would have to start again?
	The next day, I went to a local pizza place to get something to eat, when I noticed an unusual person sitting near me dressed as a cowboy. Out of curiousity, I greeted myself to him. He greeted me back, and then we started a conversation. Then I decided that maybe he knew what time it was. He nodded, and I got excited. “So, what time is it then?” I asked. “Can’t tell you” he responded. “Why not?” I questioned. “If you want to know the time, you’ll have to do a task for me: find the Big Ben” I looked at him uneasily. How could I possibly find a whole building. “I’ll give you a hint: It’s somewhere in River Thames.”. I looked at him suspiciously. “Wait a second. Did you move it there?” I asked. “Don’t ask questions. Go find the clock tower and call me when you’re done. If you complete this task, I’ll tell you the time.” he explained. I stared at him, and decided to see what he was talking about.
	“Hey guys, you wanna go on an adventure?” I asked Ryan and Daniel. “What kind of adventure?” Daniel asked. “An underwater one. We have to find the Big Ben” I explained. “What do mean, find the Big Ben?” Daniel asked again. “Don’t ask why. You wanna come or not? I said. “Sure” he said, after reluctantly staring at me. “How about you Ryan, you wanna come? I questioned Ryan. He shrugged and replied “Sure”. I walked over to an aquatic store to buy some air tanks and other materials that we needed. I came back to give them to Ryan and Daniel. They quickly put the equipment on and we walked over to the River Thames. The river’s water was a pleasant shade of blue. “On the count of three, we dive in” I exclaimed. “One… two… three!”
	We dive in with a huge splash. Even with the goggles, it is still difficult to see anything. Fortunately, the water isn’t too cold. I waddle around, looking for anything that represents a clock. It takes us a while, especially since the waves are moving us around. Finally, I notice a small golden pole. I take out of the shovels and dig around the pole.WHile Daniel and Ryan help out, a structure slowly but surely can be seen. This must be the Big Ben. We dig for about ten minutes around the humongous structure. However, when we get to the the clock part, there is a huge hole instead. I’m positive it is the Big Ben, so I swim to the surface and go back to the local pizza place. The cowboy is standing there.
	“I found it” I say. “Show me” he says, talking out one of his cigarettes. I walk back to the river where I find Daniel and Ryan waiting. The cowboy puts on the equipment, and he dives under water. I guide him where we found the huge structure. He looks at it for a while, then he goes back to the surface. He takes of the equipment. “So, you wanna know what time it is, right?” he asks. “Yes. It was part of the deal” He clears his throat. Then clearly says

These days, you only need to know the basics.  
St Peter turns to the first man and says, ""if you can explain to me the meaning of Easter, the most holy day of the Christian calendar, you can enter Heaven.""  
The first man says ""oh, of course! That's when Jesus came and drove all the snakes out of Scotland, so we drink green beer.""  
""No, that's... that's completely wrong. You're thinking of *Saint Patrick*, who in apocrypha drove the snakes out of *Ireland*. You will be sent to Hell.""  
St Peter turns to the second man and says ""well, how about you? You can enter Heaven if you can explain the meaning of Easter.""  
""Sure,"" said the second man, ""the most holy of days celebrates when the three wise men saw a drifting star and followed it to Bethlehem, where the star heralded the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. We celebrate by decorating pine trees and drinking eggnog.""  
""No, I'm sorry, but you're thinking of Christmas, not Easter. You clearly have some knowledge, though, so you must wait in purgatory for 1,000 years.""  
St Peter finally turns to the last man and says, ""Alright, let's see what you've got. Do you know the meaning of Easter?""  
The third man nods sagely, and explains, ""Jesus was feared by the pagan Romans, who saw His great teaching of love and the word of God as dangerous to their ways. They stabbed His side, made Him wear a crown of thorns, and they crucified Him along with two thieves. His body was interred in a cave, and sealed with a boulder. But after three days, the boulder was rolled back, Jesus stepped out of the cave, saw his shadow and ran back inside, and we had six more weeks of winter!""",Three men die and are at the pearly gates,4

""What in the Lord's good name is that you've put on your cigarette, Sister Agnes?"" She says.

""Why,"" says Sister Agnes, ""it's a condom."" She holds her cigarette up in the rain. ""It stops your cigarette getting wet.""

""Well, that's marvellous!"" Sister Rosemary gasps. ""What a fine idea.""

The next day, Sister Rosemary -- suitably impressed -- decides to walk down to the pharmacy in the village.

""Good morning!"" She smiles to the Saturday boy behind the till. ""I'd like some condoms please.""

He explains the problem: ""Beloved son, I am very sad, because I can't plant potatoes in my garden. I am sure, if only you were here, you would help and dig up the garden for me. I love you, Your Father.""  
The following day, the old man receives a response e-mail from his son: ""Beloved Father, please don't touch the garden. It's there that I have hidden 'the THING'. I love you, too, Ahmed"" 
At 4pm the US Army, The Marines, the FBI, the CIA and the Rangers visit the house of the old man, take the whole garden apart, search every inch, but can't find anything. Disappointed they leave the house.  
A day later, the old man receives another e-mail from his son. ""Beloved Father, I hope the garden is dug up by now and you can plant your potatoes. That's all I could do for you from here. I love you, Ahmed.""",The Old Arab and His Potatoes,61

He then inspects the Brit, who displays the same behaviour, droning, “tic … toc … tic … toc … tic … toc …” “Outstanding!” exclaims the scientist. Finally, he checks on the American. Repeatedly jerking his head to the left, the American murmurs, “tic ... tic ... tic … tic ... tic … tic ...” Frustrated, the scientist orders further treatment for the prisoners.

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

An old drunk from the nearby town was walking by at the moment, and calls out, ""Look at the size of that fucker!""
The young nun is immediately offended.  ""Sir!"" she protests, ""how dare you speak like that in front of a woman of the cloth?""
The drunk, thinking quickly, responds, ""No offense meant at all, sister!  That is the name of the fish!  It's a 'fucker' fish.  I should know, I've been fishing for years!""
""Oh,"" the nun replies, ""well, I apologize for chastising you, then."" and took the fish into the convent.
""What have you got there?"" an old groundskeeper asked her.
""It's a great big fucker!"" the nun beamed, proudly.
""Sister! how dare you speak that way!""
""No! No! That's what type of fish it is! Its a 'fucker' fish!""
""Oh, well, I had never heard of that, but let me clean it for you, and we'll cook it up.""
So the groundskeeper cleaned the fish and got it prepared to cook. And with pride, he marched the big fish into the kitchen, where the cook was prepping that night's dinner.
""What have you got there? That's a beauty!""The cook asked.
""It's a fucker!"" the groundskeeper replied, proud of his work at cleaning it.
""Sir!"" The cook chastised, ""you can't speak like that in the Lord's house!""
""No, no, no! That's the name of the type of fish! It's a fucker fish! The new, young nun caught it!""
""Oh, well, in that case, I'll cook it up for tonight's dinner, the bishop tells me that we are going to have a special guest!""
So the cook prepared the fish and cooked it to perfection, and put it out on the big banquet table where the entire population of the convent had gathered.  And then, the special guest of honor arrived.  The pope.  The group was abuzz with the arrival of their special guest and hung on every one of his words. He observed the massive spread on the table, and looked at the massive fish that was presented as a centerpiece to the meal.
""What a lovely fish!"" The pope praised.
Awash in pride, the young nun blurted out, ""I caught the fucker!""
The groundskeeper chimed in, ""I cleaned the fucker!""
and the cook shouted, ""And, I cooked the fucker!""
The room fell in complete shocked silence as the other nuns, and the bishop stared in complete horror at the language they had just heard.
""You know something,"" the Pope started, reclining in his chair, putting his hands behind his head, and putting his feet up on the table, ""you bastards are alright.""","A young nun, new to the convent, goes fishing in the pond behind the chapel.",35

""Oh definitely Wonder Woman. Her breasts were so firm...""

""Stop right there. Diana and I have been friends for a very long time, I couldn't have sex with her"" replied Superman.

Disappointed with the lack of a women, Superman decides to fly over to Central City to meet with The Flash, now being even hornier than before.

During a summer day in their 70s, Odd told his wife as they sat in the living room that he had never liked his odd name. He told her that, when he died, she should just put his birthday and date of death on the grave, without his name. Sure enough, several years later, Odd passed away. His wife did as he had requested, and buried him, putting only his birthday and date of death on the gravestone. But it was futile. To this day, people still walk by the grave and say:

He'd ask a question, and the calculator would give the answer, and every time it was the correct one. At first, people were excited, and they would demand to know what the trick was. A lot of theories, ranging from voice recognition software to sleight of hand, were thrown around.


But time and time again, the man would insist that no, it was simply a sentient calculator.


Now, at first, the people simply figured that the man didn't want to reveal his trick and left it at that. But time passed, and throughout the years, the man would show his sentient calculator again and again, and even tried to get it submitted into a technology competition. The judges laughed it out, but the man kept on going on about his sentient calculator.


After a while, people began to think he was crazy. That didn't bother him any, since his family loved him and he had his sentient calculator.


His wife, who knew him best, simply thought that this was her beloved husbands one eccentricity, and paid it no mind. She was - like everybody - slightly concerned about how much attention the man gave to the calculator, but he loved their children and was a good father and a husband, so she let it go.


Then, one night when they were lying in bed together, the man began to talk seriously about how they needed to get the calculator wider recognition. After all, he said, a sentient calculator simply can't be left to rot in the suburbs!


At first, the wife ignored this, as she had everything else about the calculator, but night after night, when they were alone, and with every indication of seriousness, the man spoke about the calculator. For a couple of weeks, the wife tried her best to ignore the man. She figured this was some sort of long joke, and waited patiently for the punchline.


It never came. What did come was more and more talk about the calculator, until finally she'd had enough. In no uncertain terms, she told the man that if he did not stop talking about the calculator, she would go to the local hospital and book him an appointment with a psychiatrist.


The man wasn't deterred. He turned to his best friend, who likewise ignored him. He went to his parents, who likewise ignored him. He spoke to professors at the local university - they all ignored him. He tried every single public official, every scientific institute, even some pseudoscientific groups; all ignored him. He was feeling blue - after all, if he couldn't get people who believed in UFOs to listen to him, who would?


He returned home, only to find that his wife had taken the children and left. Furthermore, the note on the kitchen table said she'd called the police to force him to go to the psychiatrist - and as if on cue, he heard the sirens.


Acting quickly, he ran up to the bedroom and took his shotgun out of the gun safe. Then, he ran to barricade all the doors and windows, and took up position in the second floor. From there, he could see only one squad car - but as soon as they spotted the barricades and the man peering down with a shotgun, they quickly left to call backup.


Soon enough, what seemed to be the entirety of the city's police force was at his doorstep. The man pondered his options: if he were to run, they would catch him, and there was no way for him to fight them off. Sadly, he realized that this would be his last stand. He could not let them take the calculator away.


Tears in his eyes, he turned to his calculator, and asked:


""You are my only friend in this world, and I am sorry that I can not get you the recognition you deserve. It seems as if this is the end. The only thing I ask of you is this: will you stay with me, until the end?""


And the calculator replied:


""You can count on me.""",A man owned a sentient calculator,787

Mike asks if Mars has a stock-market, if they have laptop computers, how they make money, etc. Finally, Maureen brings up the subject of sex. “Just how do you guys do it?” asks Maureen.

“Pretty much the way you do,” responds the Martian.

Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. Maureen and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He’s got only a teeny, weeny member about half an inch long and just a quarter inch thick.

I don’t think this is going to work,” says Maureen. “Why?” he asks, “What’s the matter?” “Well,” she replies, “It’s just not long enough to reach me!”

“No problem,” he says, and proceeds to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead, his member grows until it’s quite impressively long.

“Well,” she says, “That’s quite impressive, but it’s still pretty narrow…”

“No problem,” he says, and starts pulling his ears. With each pull, his member grows wider and wider until the entire measurement is extremely exciting to the woman.

“Wow!” she exclaims, as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love.

The next day the couples rejoin their normal partners and go their separate ways. As they walk along, Mike asks “Well, was it any good?” “I hate to say it,” says Maureen, “but it was pretty wonderful. How about you?”

“It was horrible,” he replies. “All I got was a headache. All she kept doing the whole time was slapping my forehead and pulling my ears.",Martian wife swap,14

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

When asked what the cannon is for, he said he is going to shoot the moon resulting in his parents locking him up in a mental institution. and after 1 year, the shrink interviewed him to see if he is fit to be released.

SHRINK: What would you do if I release you tomorrow? 


DAVID: I would sell half of my Tech stocks to generate more capital.


SHRINK: Good! and what would you do with the money?


DAVID: start a company like Elon's SpaceX.


SHRINK: (Thinking he's ready) What do you hope to accomplish with this venture?


DAVID: I will put a Nuclear warhead on my rocket and shoot the moon.

The following year:



DAVID: Look Dr. I am well, let me go! I am a rich man with 10 billion in liquid assets you are wasting my time      here. I can certainly make a difference and help solve the world's problems if you let me go.


SHRINK: Well then prove it!, What is the first thing you are going to do if I release you?


DAVID: Before I go on joining forces with Bill gates in solving the world's problems, I got to be selfish at first, I realized that what I need is a wife, A wife that is beautiful both inside out.


SHRINK: That is a good start. How do you go about finding such woman?


DAVID: I already knew one. Do you know Jennifer Lawrence?  Believe it or not, we dated back in high school. All I need is to contact her and rekindle our love.


The shrink thinking he is being delusional again contacted his parents and was informed that he was actually truthful. They really dated in high school.


SHRINK: Sorry that I did not believe you at first but go on. What would you do to win her back?


DAVID: I remember that we broke up because I did not have time for her. I was busy with my start ups.  So  first, I will ask for forgiveness, then I will invite her to my private Island in the Seychelles. Convince her that she is all I need, She is more to me than my billions. With her as my partner we can make a positive impact on this world.


SHRINK: Your prognosis is really good. I think you are ready to face the world again. But I am just curious, if she says yes, what is next?


DAVID: I will marry her in a very low key wedding, I know she does not like lavish weddings like most in Hollywood. And then we will start having cute little geniuses.


SHRINK: hold on a second, you skipped. How would you go about making babies?


DAVID: No Dr. it is a private matter, it is between Jennifer and me.


SHRINK: But it is part of my assessment!


DAVID: Ok, after our wedding. We will spend our honeymoon in one of my villas in the Seychelles, the one overlooking the bay. there, in the middle of the garden, under the light of the moon, I will slowly kiss her, and touch her inner thighs, then when I notice that her breath is becoming more rapid and her pelvis starting to spasm in that must-have-you-now way. I will slowly pull down her panty using my lips.


Shrink: Don't stop now. Show me you are capable.


DAVID: Once I got her panty. I will....take.....the garter out and MAKE A SLING AND SHOOT THE FUCKING MOON!

""Can I buy you a drink?"" He says. 

She accepts his offer with a smile, so he asks what she's having. 

""Just scotch with a couple drops of water.""

The man turns to the bartender: ""Could we get two scotches, with a couple drops of water?"" The barman nods and brings the drinks.

I was super pumped about it, and couldn't wait to drive it. The dealer who sold me it gave me a little bottle, and said, ""That's rust-preventing lubricant. If you ever have your bike outside in the rain and can't cover it up, be sure to grease it up so that it doesn't start rusting."" On that note, I tucked the bottle in my pocket and drove up to my girlfriend's work to pick her up.

So I drove my girlfriend on my brand new motorcycle to her parent's house to meet her family for the first time. We arrived just around 5:30pm. The mother comes out to us and says, ""Oh great! You came just in time for dinner!"" 

So we both go out to the table that's in the backyard. It's a cloudy, but warm day, so her family had decided to eat outside. While we are walking back there, my girlfriend pulls me aside and says, ""Okay, this might seem weird, but we have a family rule that whoever talks first at dinner has to do the dishes.""

As strange as I found that to be, I went back there anyway. I was met by her father, her grandma and grandpa, and her brother. Making no noise at all, they nodded and began to eat their food. 

I started to get a little curious about how far I could go before they would say anything, so I kissed my girlfriend right in front of them. Nobody says anything. 
So then I start full on making out with her, and again, nobody speaks up. 
I then start putting my hands underneath her skirt, making sure everyone at the table can see. Still they aren't saying anything.
Finally, I pull down her skirt and start having sex with her right on the table. The whole time, amazingly, no one says a word. I finish, and look everyone dead in the eye. It's dead silent. 

At this point I'm absolutely lost for words at how far I've gone without anyone at the table saying anything. Its pretty awkward at this point, with nobody saying anything for a solid half hour. I notice that it had been getting pretty humid outside, and I looked up at the sky. It looked like some rain was coming in, so remembering my bike I pulled out the rust preventing lubricant, to which the father stood up, slammed his hands on the table and screamed, ""ALRIGHT I'LL DO THE FUCKING DISHES!!""",My girlfriend's family rule with dishes,2

That is the first line of the joke experiment. I’m curious to see if the r/jokes community can work together to craft the Perfect Joke. I don’t know if this has been done before, but I’m sure if it’s a bad idea it will be ignored (or downvoted into oblivion) anyway.


But what if it’s not? 


So here’s how it goes: we already have the first line. You will write the second line. And the third line. And the forth and so on and so on until we reach the punch line(s). 


Comment with what you think the next line of the joke should be and/or upvote the comments you think are the best. As more and more people submit their lines and upvote each other’s lines, then the joke will hopefully begin to take shape. If you want a line to follow a line that has already been commented, simply reply to that comment. 


You can also edit the starting line of the joke, but only by substituting one of the existing words with another word or phrase, just tag it with FTFY. For example: “A blind priest walks into a bar…” -FTFY ***OR*** “A guy walks into an alternate dimension” -FTFY 


Over time, as the best lines migrate to the top, I will update this post with the lines of the joke that you write and vote for.


Let’s write the Perfect Joke

Seasons passed. The three hermits still sat in silence each day at the side of the road, begging for alms.

Five years later, the first hermit cleared his throat, and said: 

""That was a beautiful white horse.""

Seasons passed. The fortunes in the nearby village rose, then fell, then evened out. The King died peacefully in his sleep and was replaced by his son, who, on the whole, did a passable job. The three hermits still sat in silence each day at the side of the road, begging for alms.

Ten years later, the second hermit cleared his throat, and said:

""No, it was a black horse.""

Seasons passed. The new king began a public works program to pave and widen the road, but the project stalled when the local lords disputed the taxes meant to pay for the project. The landlords experimented with a new agricultural technique that was meant to improve wheat yields, though their fortunes, as had they always, still depended mostly on the weather, which, as had it always, varied from growing season to growing season. Younger villagers grew to adults, and fell in love, and started families, providing grandchildren to delight the villagers who had once been adults, but were now elders. Trees in the village square produced fruit in the spring, except for the very old trees, which had stopped producing fruit but still provided much-needed shade for the villagers at the height of summer. Flocks of birds kept to their historic migratory paths, stopping at the village pond in the fall to fish, and rest, before leaving again for warmer places. The three hermits still sat in silence each day at the side of the road, begging for alms.

Twenty years later, the third hermit, his beard now much longer and not a little bit greyer, stood, cleared his throat, and said:

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

A couple lives nearby some train tracks and it makes a thundering noise when it passes. The lady and her husband learned to sleep with ear covers and all that and made the best of the situation since it was the only place they could afford. 

But their closet door sat just right that when the train passed it would wobble in its sliders just so and open. By the time the train passed, the door would be open all the way. This was a nuisance with always closing the door every hour that one day, when her husband was at work, she decided to call a handyman to look at it. 

He soon arrives and observed the effect when a train passes, but he isnt sure what causes it or what modifications the door needs so that it will stop wobbling open. He decides to sit in the closet and wait for the next time it happens, to see if he can observe the cause. He doesnt really fit in the closet so he takes off his tool belt and leaves it by the closet door. 

In the mean time, the husband gets back home early and the wife greets him. He is a super jealous man though, and blows up when he sees the handyman's shoes in front of the bedroom, and sees his belt beside the closet. 

He asks if she is cheating on him and opens the closet to find the other man in there. The husband grabs the man by the collar of his shirt and pulls him out. 

""What are you doing here?!"" He asked. 

The handyman replies, "" you won't believe this, but I'm waiting for the train.""",A handy man in the closet,6
