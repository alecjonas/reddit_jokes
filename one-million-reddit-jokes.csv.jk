Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... 

But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery,11

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't. So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step, and, once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg.

With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.

She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and yelled, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!""

Just the sight of her turned his stomach into a butterfly exhibit and caused his heart to melt through his chest. She was the sweetest, funniest, and nicest girl he had ever met. She was truly an angel. However, as is the case with most guys when trying to talk to the girl of their dreams, he was always at a loss for words. He just couldn’t seem to talk to her. All he could do was consistently talk about her with his friends, and his friends were getting annoyed. “Just go ask her to prom!”, his friends kept telling him as Spring Prom was just around the corner. “But there is no way the most beautiful girl in the world, would go out with someone like me!” he kept contesting. Finally, after many days of mental distraught, he finally got up enough courage to ask her to prom, and to his utter astonishment, she said yes!

Well given the girl of his dreams was going to prom with him, he knew he had to make it just right. Given the prom was only 2 days away he had so much to do in such little time! That afternoon, he went to the tuxedo store to get a custom tux. However, upon arrival, he was distraught to see a line out the door. Apparently he wasn’t the only one who had secured a date with a fine young lady this weekend!  Finally he made it to the front of line and was fitted for a tux. Unfortunately, due to all the orders, his wouldn’t be ready until Sunday morning.

He could barely sleep Saturday night as he was so nervous. None the less, he was back the tux shop early Sunday morning. However to his horror, the line was just as long, if not longer than before! He had no option but to wait in line. After a few hours, he finally got his tux… and then he realized, “Flowers! I forgot the flowers!” So he drove over to the nearest florist to pick up a bouquet and corsage for his lady. But once again, he was met with a line out the door. Ages past, but he finally got his flowers.
Wanting to make sure she had the best night ever, he knew he had to pick her up in a limo. There was no other option. Alas, when he arrived to pick up the limo, there was a huge line for limo rentals! What are the odds!? As he was waiting in line, he kept looking at his watch and watched as the time kept frittering away. FINALLY he got to the front of line and got his limo. By this time, it was time to pick her up.

Oh was he nervous! However, when she answered the door, he managed to squeak out “wow, you look absolutely stunning!” He had never seen anyone this gorgeous in his life! He took her arm in his and led her to the limo.

To his utter disgust, when they arrived at the location, the line to get in was weaving down what seemed like half the city. They had no option but to wait in line yet again. After the longest wait yet, they finally got in, found a table, and were greeted with yet another line to get their food! All he wanted was to sit down and have a lovely meal with his date. Thankfully, this line didn’t take too long and they were soon seated and sharing a great meal. Everything was going well and they had a great time laughing and talking together. Once the meal was over, they decided to head over to the dance floor…and you guessed it. It was full and there was a line to get in. At this point he was so frustrated with lines, but he had no option other than to wait yet again. Finally they got into the floor and had a great time dancing the night away. Near the end of the evening, she said “Hey, im thirsty, let’s get some punch!” So they walked over to the punch table, and got some punch.

For you see, there was no punchline...",A young boy asks the girl of his dreams to prom.,45

If someone yells give them a soak,
Go ahead make a joke...

Ok heres a joke to make you chuckle,
its a bumpy ride so use your buckle,
There once was a bull named Fumanshoo,
Fumanshoo ate grass until he grew, 
900lbs was Fumanshoo, 900lbs of perfect beef stew,

But Fuman had different plans in mind,
He knew the farmer wanted to eat his kind..

Day by day he made his plan,
no one was putting Fuman in the frying pan..

Fuman knew the farmer had a plane,
and if he could steal it he could fly to Spain and see his girl friend once again..

One day the farmer pissed off the rooster, 
an intense battle, but Fuman had a chance to seize his future,
He gave his fence bash and made his dash,
Shots rang out as the motor cranked,
But the plane was rolling to the cow gods he thanked,

Fuman knew what he had to do,
Fuman wanted to make farmer stew,
He pointed the plane and was headed for the farmer,
But deep down Fuman believed that there was karma,
So instead of Fuman turning the farmer into Farmer stew,
he simply ran the farmer into a big pile a Fuman poo...

Fuman flew and toward the sun,
Fuman was proud of the job that he'd done.",Fumanshoo the Bull - (Poem),2

Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. 

After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. 

Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. 

The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face. The man at the front of the line turned around and said ""that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.""

There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody. Amen.

The  Lone  Ranger  was ambushed and captured by a  hostile Indian War Party.

The Indian Chief proclaimed, 

 ""So, YOU  are the great Lone Ranger...

In honour of the Buffalo Hunt, YOU will be sacrificed in three days.""

Before we  kill you, I grant you three requests. What is  your FIRST request?'

The Lone  Ranger said, 

""I'd like to speak to my horse Silver.""

The Chief  nodded “yes” and Silver was brought before the  Lone Ranger who whispered in Silver's  ear, and the horse galloped away.

Later that evening, Silver returned with a beautiful blonde woman on his back.

As the  Indian Chief watched, The blonde  entered the Lone Ranger's tent and spent  the night.

The next  morning the Indian Chief admitted that he was  impressed.

""You have a very fine and loyal horse. But we will  still kill you in two days.""

""What is  your SECOND request?""

The Lone  Ranger again asked to speak to his horse.

Silver came  to  him,  And he  again whispered in the horse's ear.

As before,  Silver took off and disappeared over the  horizon.

Later that  evening, to the Chief's surprise, Silver  again returned,

this time  with a  voluptuous  brunette,  Even more  attractive than the blonde.

She entered the Lone Ranger's tent  and spent  the night. 

The  following morning the Indian Chief said:  ""You are  indeed a man of many talents,

""but we  will still kill you tomorrow.""

""What is your LAST request?""

The Lone  Ranger responded,

""I'd like  to speak to my horse - alone.""

The Chief  was curious, but he agreed, and Silver  was brought to  The Lone  Ranger's tent.

Once  they were  alone, The Lone  Ranger grabbed Silver by both ears,

looked him  square in the eye and said, 

 

""Listen Very  Carefully!

 

FOR...THE...LAST...TIME...

I have no idea what he was offering me, but in haste, I said ""No thanks""

Then he goes into the kitchen...brings out a bunch of cookies and gives one to everyone but me.

I said ""That's fucked up man, I really wanted a cookie""

The next day I was at home with my wife. She says ""Hey Alan, do you wanna \(jumbled words\)""

Thinking about that cookie, I said ""Fuck yeah""

She starts putting her shoes on, I'm like ""What are you doing?"" she's like ""I just asked if you wanna go jogging, and you said yes""

""Oh.....................................In that case, No the fuck I do not""

I'll tell you what, you go jogging, by yourself. And if you really love me, You'll bring me back a cookie",I'm about 80% Deaf,4

The talent agent cuts him off and says “no we don’t do family acts. They’re too cute.” 

The dad responds with “Ah yes, but this is a type of cute you’ve never seen before.”

The talent agent nods and says. “Alright, let’s see what you got.”

The mom and dad start profusely making out, tongues, hands and everything. 

The agent raises an eyebrow and says “This is an odd start but I like where it’s going.” 

Then the kids start making out too, tongue and cheek literally. The uncle is shoving the baby’s face in grandma’s tits, sending them both into pure bliss. Meanwhile the dad had his and his wife’s clothes off and hand a fist up her ass and down her throat. The kids are meanwhile watching this, shoving various objects from the agent’s desk such as pens, pencils and scissors up into various orifices and any hole they could find on themselves. The grandma’s now using the baby’s legs as a dildo as the uncle, now naked, runs around licking any fluid as it drips down. He tastes sweat, blood, cum.

Eventually the dad cums in his wife’s bloody throat which she then chokes on, throws up and then passes out face first into the carpet. 

The Agent is now calling the police, noticing the sun shoving a glass rod up his erect penis and then bending it like a glow stick, being able to hear various pops and cracks. He then fucks his sister with his tiny broken penis and she was just not enjoying it. 

The uncle was now fucking the unconscious mom in her bloodied mouth, he thrusts hard enough for her head to whip back and being able to hear the audible snap of her neck breaking. He then twists her neck back and forth until her turns it a complete 180° and then takes a pen, shoved it into her neck to make a new hole for him to fuck. 

The brother got a little too excited and came the bloody, pissy semen inside of his sister. She uses a broken shard of glass to cut off the brother’s penis and shove him off of her. It’s pretty hard to distinguish the brother and the sister at this point. 

Now this is when it gets gross. 

The grandma had managed to shove the whole of baby’s head up her ass which cause the skull to collapse. She took the baby out and whipped its head off to get a better look at it. The dad now had a hold of the baby’s corpse and saw a new hole where the head used to be. He started to fuck the baby’s esophagus, blood squirting out like a fountain as he did so. 

The Grandma now stood up and walked over to the brother, and sat on his face, grinding herself up and down on him. His ribs and nose broke. His lungs became punctured and died quickly from internal breathing.

Just about every bodily fluid you could think of was around the room and on the windows at this point. 

The Uncle shoved his cock inside of the daughter’s already gaping and bleeding ass as he takes out a noose and chokes her with it before hanging it on the chandelier in the room. The daughter’s strangled to death and climaxes just before she loses consciousness. 

It’s only the dad and the uncle now, so they took some crowbars and starts to hit the hanging still dying daughter like a piñata. It started out with hard crunches with every swing but slowing started to become softer as the insides of her body turned to a paste of blood, lymph, bones and organs. 

Now the dad, realizing at this point that the uncle raped his daughter, in a fit of rage swung his crow bar into the uncle’s head and the force was so powerful his upper head collapsed in and his eyes burst out, being pushed by brain matter. 

The dad then finally put his cock inside his daughter’s pussy, which at this point was leaking out her uterus, ovaries and her ass was leaking out her intestines. He finishes finally inside of her and approaches the talent Agent.

The agent was amazed. “Wow!” He says. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life! What do you call yourselves?”

The dad walked up to the agent’s drakes and asked for a pocket knife. 

The agent thinks ‘he seems like a sane and reasonable guy’ so he hand shin the pocket knife. 

The dad carves “The Aristocrats” in the wood of the desk, fills the grooves with puss from the baby’s body and then uses the pocket knife to slit his throat and die, face first down on the desk. 

The cops arrive finally and the agent is arrested for mass homicide.

She came home from school one day and screamed at her dad, asking why he gave her such a stupid name. Carol took the blame to protect his wife and apologized. In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away. 

Minutes later, Carol's wife came home and saw him lying on the ground. ""What happened?"" She asked, running to him. 

He waved her closer, and whispered, ""Shot through the heart, and you're to blame. Darling, you gave Love a bad name.""",A boy named Carol had a particularly rough childhood because of his uncommon name,5712

Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress. He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, and heads back to the showers.

He is halfway down the hall when he sees three nuns heading his way. Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue. The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood. Startled, he drops a bar of soap. ""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"". To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice and three times but nothing happens. So she gives several more tugs, then yells ""Holy Mary, Mother of God, HAND LOTION TOO!""",Soap,3

During triage the nurse asks how the Sean sustained the injuries. After a nudge from his wife, he sullenly replies ""I was looking over my shoulder and walked into a door."" The nurse wonders how he hit his nose if he was looking back but decides not to question him further and discharges him.

A week later the wife brings him in again, this time he has two black eyes, and the hair on the back of his head is matted with blood. During triage, the nurse asks whether the injuries are due to domestic abuse and how they were obtained. He glances at his wife and quickly replies ""no no, I bent to pick up something on the floor and hit my head on the doorknob standing back up."" Again the nurse doubts his story, and slips some domestic abuse resources into his discharge paperwork.

A month later, the Sean comes in alone, with a broken arm and missing a tooth. The nurse says ""before we start, I want to remind you that you are in a safe place and there are places you can go if you need somewhere to stay. Now tell me what happened and be honest, we all know one does not simply walk into more doors.""

An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

Since she’s basically adopted it, we decided we might as well get him fixed at the same time we got our new dog fixed.

The two had met in a bar on a clear, starry night in the middle of July. The second Zachary had stepped in his gaze immediately met Angie’s. He approached her without a thought as to what he would say and had taken a seat mere inches from her. She turned to him, a gleam in her eyes as she introduced herself. “Good evening, the name’s Angie. How are you tonight?” A faint seductiveness in her voice sent a tingle down Zachary’s spine as he hurried. “Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?”
Now, Zachary was always a fairly shy man. Despite his appearance he was never one for starting conversation and his fear was only elevated even more by the fact that Angie was by far the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
The two talked some more throughout the night and eventually grew comfortable with one another. Despite her lifestyle Angie’s favourite genre of music had turned out to be soft-rock, which lo and behold Zachary was an artist in. “Why don’t you come to my concert? I’m playing tomorrow night at the theatre south of town and I’d love to have you there with me.”
Angie had sprung on the offer, not wasting a second as she accepted with a great deal of enthusiasm. She gave him her address and phone number with a small note written on the bottom right: “pick me up at 10” with a heart drawn right next to it.
The next night Angie had waited for her parents to go to bed before going out to wait at her door for Zachary. Luckily, he’d arrived in the nick of time. “I’m on in an hour. If we hurry we can make it about 10 minutes early.”
Once the two had arrived Zachary led Angie backstage, telling her to wait for his call in order to find the best seat in the theatre to watch him play. Not five minutes passed once her phone buzzed, with the message “there’s a seat right in front of the mic stand, I got the set-up crew to reserve it for you.”
Once the concert had begun Zachary stepped up to the mic and looked right into Angie’s eyes while saying “this first song goes out to the most amazing woman I’ve ever had the chance of meeting.”
Throughout the concert Angie’s eyes were glued to Zachary. She could feel herself falling deeper and deeper in love with him as he played, her beautiful, green eyes still stuck to his image long after the final song had been played.
Once backstage Angie had rushed toward her lover, locking lips with him and holding him as close to her as she could. Once the kiss had broken she jumped in place ecstatically, screaming in joy “that was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen, Zachary! You were incredible out there!”
The drummer could be heard from the snack table, “I’m here, too, you know,” but to no avail.
Zachary led Angie to the side where he held her hands and gazed deeply into her eyes, and said to her:
“Angie, I can’t stay here forever. I’m always travelling and I can’t just leave my life behind.”
Angie’s eyes welled up as she fought to choke back tears.
“Please, don’t cry. We can work around that.”
“How?” Whispered Angie, her throat still sore from crying.
“Come with me! We can travel the world together! You can leave this old melon business behind and we could be together!”
“I...” Angie said to herself.
“What is it?”
“I don’t think that’s possible.”
“Why not?” Now Zachary was starting to cry.
“My father would never approve of it. He wants me to become a farmer just like him to keep the family business running.”
“Angie, please,” begged Zachary. “I love you so much! I don’t want to leave you behind!”
“I’m sorry, my dear,” cried Angie, wiping the tears from her cheek. “I cantaloupe.”",The daughter of a melon farmer and a travelling musician met one day and fell in love at first sight,6

Being the older brother, he naturally got everything first. One day, Tony biked to Oliver with his new, red, shiny bike and said “look how cool my bike is.”

Oliver looked and said “Yeah, it’s a pretty cool bike. But I bet you can’t go down death mountain with it.” 

Tony, wanting to prove his brother wrong, biked up to the top of death mountain and went down the almost vertical drop, breaking many bones in the process. And at the bottom of the hill, was a priest.

The priest said “you should spend the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.” Tony, not wanting to show his brother his failure, agreed. He went inside the house and fell onto the bed, but only slept four hours, as there was a constant screaming he heard. In the morning, he asked the priest:

“What was all that screaming last night?” Said Tony.
The priest replied, “I can’t tell you, because you’re not a priest.”

Tony grows up and gets his first car. He drives it over to Oliver and says, “Hey man, check out my new car. Pretty sweet, right?”
Oliver looks at it and says “Yeah, it’s pretty nice. But I bet you can’t go down death mountain with it.”

Again, wanting to prove his brother wrong, he pulls up to the edge of the mountain and floors the pedal. He completely totals the car, and barely makes it out before it catches on fire, dislocating his shoulder in the process. And at the bottom of the hill, is a priest. 

The priest tells him, “You should spend the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.” Tony falls onto the bed again, but only sleeps for two hours, as the screaming is so loud and unbearable. 

He gets up in the morning, and asks the priest: “what was all that screaming last night?”  The priest says “I can’t tell you, because you’re not a priest.”

Tony grows a little older and goes to college, gets the girl, and gets a nice job, which gave him a very nice company car. He parks in front of Oliver and says “Hey man, check out my ride.” And Oliver says “Yeah, it’s nice, but can it go down death mountain?”

Again, tony drives to the top, goes barrelling down, and completely smashes his car, leather seats ripped and tires in shreds. He gets out looking really bad. And at the bottom of the hill, is a priest.

The priest says to him “You should spend the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.” He does spend the night, but only sleeps for an hour, because of how loud the unbearable screaming is, as if nothing existed in the next room over but pain. In the morning, he asks the priest:

“What was all that screaming?”
The priest replied “I can’t tell you, because you’re not a priest.”

Tony grows even older and has a few kids, so he buys a mini van. He drives to Oliver and says “Hey man, check this out. Isn’t it cool?”
Oliver says “Yeah, it’s cool. But can you go down death mountain with it?”
Tony drives to the edge, takes one look at the ground below, and takes the car down the massive mountain, smashing it to pieces. And at the bottom of the hill, is a priest.

The priest says “you should stay the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.” He does stay, but only sleeps for half an hour, as the screaming is so unbearably horrible he gets almost no sleep. A constant high pitched cry of agony consumes the air around him. In the morning, he asks: 
“What was all that screaming?”
The priest says “ I cannot tell you, because you’re not a priest.”

Tony’s wife eventually leaves him, stating in the divorce he took too many dives off of death mountain. She takes the kids and the car, along with most of the money. Tony could only buy himself a tiny electric scooter. He takes it to Oliver and says “Check out my cool scooter.”

Oliver says “Yeah, It’s cool. But I betcha can’t go down death mountain with it.

Tony doesn’t even stop at the top of the mountain, as he just jumped immediately off of it as soon as he arrived to the summit, Breaking many bones. And at the bottom of the hill is a priest.

The priest says “You should spend the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.” Tony tries with all his might to go to sleep, but can only accomplish a measly one minute of sleep, Because the screaming is so loud it feels as if it’s coming from within him. In the morning he asks the priest:
“What was all that screaming?”
The priest tells him “I cannot tell you, because you’re not a priest.

Tony decided he’d had enough, and needed to know what was happening inside the priest’s house. So he goes and studies hard, night and day, to become a priest. Working long hours at the church made days go on forever but he eventually was accepted into the church of Christianity as a fully fledged priest. He returns years later with an old car and drives off death mountain, totalling the car, and suffering many major injuries. And at the bottom of the hill is a priest.

The priest says “You should spend the night, as you have many cuts and bruises.”  He spends the night but never sleeps, because the screaming is so horrid that he thinks he’ll never sleep again. But in the morning, he asks the priest:
“What was all that screaming?”
The priest says “I can’t tell you, because you’re not a priest.”
“But I am a priest, I even have my documents with me.” Says Tony, as he shows him the papers.
“Hmm... I see.” Says the priest. And so he told him what the screaming was.

But I can’t tell you, Because you’re not a priest.




",Tony and Oliver had quite the sibling rivalry.,4

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""

Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""

Harry: ""Pants.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, but a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong.""

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,106

George Keats had trained 20 years for this moment. He had mastered the Russian language in its native accent. He learned all of Russia's customs and social graces. He memorized Moscow streetmaps and knew every back-alley there was. He swore that he could even think like a Russian.

The big day finally came, and he was parachuted to the outskirts of Moscow at night. He emerged by daybreak, and hopped onto a bus going to the city center.

""Comrade. How much for a ticket to Red square?"", he asked the conductor in authentic Russian.

""5 Rubles, Comrade American"", came the reply.

Keats was stunned. Perhaps the conductor was just being a smart-ass. He hopped off the bus and asked a passerby for directions to the closest bar.

""It's just around the block, Comrade American.""

Keats' doubts grew immensely. Not knowing what to do, he went inside the bar and ordered a glass of Vodka.

""Want some Borscht to go with it, Comrade American?"", the bartender asked.

Keats threw a fit. ""What's the matter with you people? I dress just like you, I speak just like you, I even THINK just like you! Why does everyone keep calling me American?""

post,8j80xt,2qh72,jokes,false,1526255510,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8j80xt/dear_tech_support/,self.jokes,,"Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, Desperate

Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command ""! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech Support

Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks, Troubled User

Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes Dear"" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck, Tech Support",Dear Tech Support,106

I don't have my sheet with me, so you'll have to tell me how you died. Whichever one of you died the most painful death can get in first."" St. Peter approaches the first guy and listens to his story.

""I got home early and wanted to surprise my wife. I head up to my apartment on the 14th story of this complex, and there I find my wife laying naked on the bed. I was furious! So I looked around for the guy fucking my wife. I searched under the bed, behind the curtains, behind the couch, in the bathroom, in the closet, but I found no one. Then I see this guy hanging on my balcony for dear life. I go over to him and start slamming his fingers with my fists. He doesn't even budge; so I start stomping on his fingers. Nothing! Eventually I grab a hammer from my tool bag and start breaking every finger until he falls. The fucker landed in some bushes and lived! I was so absolutely livid that I dragged my refrigerator to the balcony and pushed it over, squashing that bastard. But after realizing what I had done, and that my marriage was over, I went for my gun in the dresser and shot myself.""

St. Peter takes note of the hole in his head, and goes to the next guy. ""Wow, what happened to you?"" he asked.

""Well, I live on the 15th story of an apartment complex. I had just gotten done with my late-morning jog and went on my balcony to stretch. Somehow I lost my footing and toppled over my balcony, but caught on to the balcony below mine. I was just thinking how lucky I was when this... madman runs over and starts pounding on my fingers! I was barely able to hold on, then he stopped. As I started climbing again he began to stomp on my fingers. I was mere moments from dropping, and he stopped again. I tried to climb yet again, only to have my fingers broken with a hammer! I had to let go, and fell for what seemed forever. I landed on some bushes, I think, and realized that I was more-or-less okay! I looked at my legs to check if they were broken, then looked back up at the balcony only to see a fridge hurtling towards me... And that's the last thing I remember.""

St. Peter sees the mangled body this guy is sporting, and moves to the last guy.

""And what's your story?""

Since she needed a good clean up I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that I noticed that her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away. 

Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't use because you say they are too tight. 

I also gave her the underwear that was your Anniversary present, which you don't use because I don't have good taste.

 I went and found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas, which you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated the boots you bought at that expensive boutique  and don't use because someone in your office has the same pair"" 

The husband took a deep breath and continued- ""she was so grateful for my understanding and help and as I walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, 

""Please, do you have anything else that your wife  doesn’t use?""",Kindness of a disrespectful pig,556

post,8j3s8h,2qh72,jokes,false,1526218255,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8j3s8h/canadian_tax_refunds/,self.jokes,,"After filing their personal tax returns by April 30th, many Canadians will again receive a tax refund.

This is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it in a Q &amp; A format:

Q. What is a tax refund payment?
A. It's money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.

Q.. Where will the government get this money?
A. From taxpayers.

Q. So the government is giving me back my own money?
A. Only a smidgen of it.

Q. What is the purpose of this payment?
A. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy.

Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?
A. You're getting ahead of me. 

Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the Canadian economy by spending your tax refund wisely:

* If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, the money will go first to the U.S. &amp; then to China or Sri Lanka.

* If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to the Arabs.

* If you purchase a computer, it will go to India, Taiwan or China.

* If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to The U.S., Mexico, Honduras or Guatemala.

* If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea.

* If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan.

* If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go to management bonuses and they will hide it off shore.

Instead, keep the money in Canada by:

1) Spending it at yard sales, or 

2) Going to hockey games, or 

3) Beer.
