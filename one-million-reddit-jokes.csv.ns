The second bull says, ""Fuck that. I've made more calves than the both of you. I'm not worried.""

Just then, their master's cart came up over the hillside, from the market. In it was the most enormous bull that they had ever seen in their life. Twice as tall and 4 times as wide as any one of them.

The third bull, quiet up to this point, begins roaring, snorting, and tamping the ground.

The other two look at him in confusion. One says, ""Hey man, what are you doing? He's way bigger than any of us. It's okay to be scared.""

The third bull says, ""Scared? Naw. I just wanted to make sure he knew I was a bull.""",3 Bulls,56

One day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long the dog discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch.

The dog thinks, “Oh boy, I’m in deep stuff now.” Then he notices some bones lying nearby on the ground and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat.

Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, “That was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more around here?”

Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, and slinks away into the trees. “Whew”, says the leopard. “That was close. That dog nearly had me.”

Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard.

So off he goes. But the dog sees him heading off after the leopard and figures that something is amiss. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans about the dog’s ruse and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, “Hop on my back, monkey, and see what’s going to happen to that conniving canine. “Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, “Oh boy, it looks like I’ve really had it now.”

But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to the leopard and the monkey and pretends that he hasn’t seen them. And just when they get close enough to hear him, the dog says… “Where is that monkey? .. I sent him off an hour ago to get me another leopard and he’s still not back.”",A Dog and a Leopard,800

...and has a few drinks.  Upon leaving the man sees a large jar of money sitting at the end of the bar. Curious, he asks the bartender, ""What is that large jar of money for?"" The bartender replys, ""It's a local bet that I have running.""  

He then explains that if someone can make the bartender's mule laugh they will win the jar of money but, it costs $10 to try.

The man says, ""I can make your mule laugh, so I'll take that bet.""  With that he tosses $10 into the jar and the bartender tells him to wait out front for him.

After a few minutes the bartender brings the mule around and the man walks up and whispers something in the mules ear. At this point the mule starts laughing hysterically. The bartender is quite surprised, but hands over the large jar of money. The man thanks the bartender, pays for his drinks and leaves.

A few years later the man passes by the bar again. Remembering the bar he stops for a drink. Again there is a large jar of money on the bar. So the man asks, ""So what's the bet this time?"" The bartender tells him that if he can make the mule cry, he can have the jar of money or pay $10 for failure.

post,6hd2tu,2qh72,jokes,false,1497504549,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6hd2tu/whats_the_sound_from_the_monastery/,self.jokes,,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

""Do you want me to tell you what it was?""

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Most would laugh at him, saying, ""You are ridiculous to believe that someone's soul would be stored in comets after they pass! You surely can't be serious!""

But Joke kept his belief, and his family stood firmly behind him on it as well, believing it just as much as he did. 

When he died, there was a service, and they buried him at night. At the end of his burial, everyone looked up to the stars.

They all whispered quietly, ""A new star is born for Joke, who has passed on from us into the heavens.""

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

Since his remaining hearing was sufficient, he remained in the Army. Many years later he eventually rose to the rank of Major General. 

He was, however, very sensitive about his appearance. One day the General was interviewing three servicemen who were candidates for his headquarters staff.     

The first was a Squadron Leader pilot from Air Force , and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the General asked him, 'Do you notice anything different about me?'    The young officer answered, 'Why, yes, Sir, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears.'  The general was displeased with his lack of tact and threw him out.    

The second interview was with a Naval Lieutenant Commander, and he was even better. The General then asked him the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' He replied sheepishly, 'Well, sir, you have no ears.' The General threw him out also.    

The third interview was with an Infantryman and a commando qualified Major.

The General liked this guy, and went ahead with the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' To his surprise the Major said, 'Yes, sir, you wear contact lenses.'    

The General was very impressed and thought, 'What an incredibly observant officer, and he didn't mention my ears.'

He asked, 'Major, how do you know I wear contacts?' 'Well, sir,' the officer replied, 'It's pretty hard to wear glasses with no f******g ears.'",A young Army officer was severely wounded in the head by a grenade,420

The problem occurs when cells are instructed by the little chromosomes to make a male baby instead.  Because there are only so many cells to go around, the cells necessary to develop a male's reproductive organs have to come from cells already assigned elsewhere in the fetus..

Recent tests have shown that these cells are removed from the communications center of the brain, migrate lower in the body and develop into male sexual organs. If you visualize a normal brain to be similar to a full deck of cards, this means that males are born a few cards short, so to speak.  And some of their cards are in their shorts.

This difference between the male and female brain manifests itself in various ways. Little girls will tend to play things like house or learn to read.

Little boys, however, will tend to do things like placing a bucket over their heads and running into walls. Little girls will think about doing things before taking any action. Little boys will just punch or kick something and will look surprised if someone asks them why they just punched their little brother who was half asleep and looking the other way.

This basic cognitive difference continues to grow until puberty, when the hormones kick into action and the trouble really begins. After puberty, not only the size of the male and female brains differ, but the center of thought also differs. Women think with their heads. Male thoughts often originate lower in their bodies where their ex-brain cells reside.

Of course, the size of this problem varies from man to man. In some men only a small number of brain cells migrate and they are left with nearly full mental capacity but they tend to be rather dull, sexually speaking. Such men are known in medical terms as ""Liberals."" Other men suffer larger brain cell relocation. These men are medically referred to as ""Conservatives.""

A small number of men suffer massive brain cell migration to their groins. These men are usually referred to as ""Mr. President.""","The difference between boys, girls and politicians.",0

Behind a bush near the lake sat a bear. The bear looked at the fish, then at the fly, then back at the fish, and then finally the fly. He thought to himself, ""If the fly came down 6 inches, that fish would jump up to eat it and i could catch that fish!"".

Little did the bear know, a hunter was lurking in the shadows, and he had his sights set on the bear. He saw the bear watching the fish, and the fish watching the fly. He thought to himself, ""Man! If that fly over there came down 6 inches the fish would jump to eat the fly and that bear will try and catch that fish, and Ill be able to shoot me a bear!""

While the hunter kept his sights locked onto the bear, waiting for his moment, a delicious cheese sandwich sat unattended in his lunchbox he so foolishly left open. A mouse has caught onto this delicious sight. He glanced at the hunter to look for an opening, noticing him setting his sights on the bear. He then looked at the fish the bear was staring at and noticed the fly buzzing above the fish. He thought to himself, ""Man! If that fly came down 6 inches, that fish would jump up to eat it, the bear would catch the fish, and the hunter would go after the bear! Then I could have this delicious sandwhich.

The mouse, ever so fascinated by such a gourmet meal, had not noticed the cat hiding above him in the tree. The cat crouched down, ready to pounce, watching the mouse watch the hunter, the hunter watching the bear, the bear watching the fish, and the fish watching the fly, and thought to himself, ""Man! If that fly came down 6 inches, that fish would jump up to eat it, the bear would catch the fish, the hunter would go for the bear, the mouse would try and steal the sandwich, and I can catch me a mouse!""

Well, a few minutes passed, and the fly lowered 6 inches. The fish immediately jumps out of the water and catches the fly. The bear lunges from out behind the bush and tries to grab the fish. BAM! The hunter shoots the bear and runs in to confirm his kill. The mouse sees this and makes a mad dash for the sandwich. The cat crouches down and leaps for the mouse, missing and landing face first into the lake.

He gets back home and starts to notice that there are 3 rats following him everywhere he goes. After an hour, the number has increased to 40, and he realizes that he has the golden rat statue with him. 

He finds the nearest lake and tosses the golden rat statue in. All the rats go in after it, drowning in the process. 

A few weeks later, the man is back in California, and goes back in the shop. 

The shop owner remembers his face and says, ""You again. I bet you want to know the story behind the golden rat now, huh?""

Next thing I knew the manager was standing right beside me, throwing in his two pence worth as well. I remember what he said to the letter. He said: “In 25 years I’ve never seen anything like this.”

So I said: “I know I’m not much to look at but that’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?” But he wasn’t listening, he was just waving his arms saying he was going to “throw me out” and that security was “on its way.”

At that point I just thought “Oh, I don’t need this”.

So I stood up and said: “Fuck it, come on kids we’re leaving.”

All was happinnes, until my clever uncle ruined it by making up words. We eventually convinced him that even if he has to get rid of some ""N""s, the Ns don't justify the neans.

My little sister, who is learning to read, was convinced they were for eating. I told her that no, there's no edible version of scrabble, but if there is, I’ll eat my words.

Somewhere in the third match, I pulled out RBLTOUE. I thought to myself, “this could spell trouble"". Friend of mine lost that match. Didn’t look good from the word go.

Old McDonald had a rubbish hand at scrabble. E-I-E-I-O. This almost causes a fight. Scrabble is all fun and games until someone loses an i.

Congratulations to my aunt who won in the final score check. She’s celebrating with a night on the tiles. She keept taking all of one letter out of the bag when playing Scrabble, and didn’t play them. She’s a beekeeper.

He told the agent that he wanted to be a big star and that he wanted the agent to represent him. The agent asked the man's name, to which he proudly replied, ""Penis Van Lesbian."" Taken aback, the agent said, ""If you want to be a big star, you will have to change your name."" 

The man, somewhat offended, told the agent, ""The Van Lesbian name goes back centuries and I am very proud of my name! I will never change my name! Ever!"" ""Then I won't be able to represent you."" Said the agent. ""Then good day to you, sir!"" The man yelled as he stormed out of the office.

Five years later, the agent received a letter along with a check for $50,000, written out to him. He wondered if it was sent to him by mistake until he read the letter.

The letter said:

Dear Sir, Five years ago, I came into your office wanting to become an actor in Hollywood and you told me I needed to change my name. Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis Van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said. I decided you were right. I had to change my name. I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation. Thank you for your advice..

Sincerely,
Dick Van Dyke

He thinks, ""This would be perfect! I love kids and driving""
So, he gets an interview of the boss and he nails it.
The boss says, ""Congratulations!  You'll be driving the SESAME STREET BUS.  I hope you can handle strange kids""
He got a map of the route and the keys to the bus and waited for Monday.
On Monday, he starts out and heads for the first stop.  See a young boy standing at the corner.
Opens the door and says, ""Hi!  I'm your new school bus driver.  What's your name?""
The kid responds, ""I'm Lester Kees""
""Well, go sit down and we'll get you to the school""
He starts driving off and notices that Lester is sitting in the middle of the isle with his shoes off, picking at a bunion on his foot!
Whatever and he drives to the next stop.
At the next stop there were these 2 huge fat girls standing there
Opens the door and says, ""Hi!  I'm your new school bus driver.  What's your name?""
The first one climb up and says, ""I'm Fat Patty""
The second one gets on the bus and says, ""I'm Fat Patty too!""

He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound.....But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road,99
