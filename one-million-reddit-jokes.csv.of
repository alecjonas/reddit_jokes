To the Greek, the angel said, ""You engage in perverted sexual practices. You can come back to life only if you remain celibate. We will test you to make sure you comply."" He agrees. 

To the Jew, the angel said, ""Your vice is greed. You can come back to life only if you reform your avaricious ways. But you will be tested."" He agrees.

As the three resurrected men are walking down the street, they pass a bar. The Irishman resists. They pass a second bar. He resists again. They pass a third bar, and the Irishman can't resist any longer - he runs toward the bar and instantly disappears in a puff of smoke. 

Frightened, the Greek and the Jew continue walking. The Jew spots a penny on the ground, and is able to resist picking it up. Then it turns into a quarter. Still he resists. Then it turns into a dollar. He wavers, but still resists. 

It turns into a five. Nope.

It turns into a ten. Nope.

I looked at the horse; he looked at me. We had an understanding. He wanted us to put him out out of his misery. But before I raised my fist, the stallion rested his head, closed his eyes, and whinnied his last.

Somewhat relieved, I told Ted what we must do now: we had to make sure.

The man told himself, ""I have faith in God! He will protect me!""

So he filled up sandbags and piled them high around his house, certain that his faith in his creator would protect him.

The next morning the water was up to the edge of his sandbags. A boat came by. The driver called out to the man, ""Sir! The water is going to keep rising, if you don't get on this boat you are going to die!""

But the man said, ""I have faith in my savior! God and Jesus will protect me!""

So the boat left.

Later that day a helicopter flew over the man's house. By this time the water had risen so high that the man was on the very top of his roof with the water just below his feet. The pilot called out, ""Sir! The water is still rising! If you don't get on this helicopter you will drown!""

But the man said again, ""My God will protect me!""

The man drowned.

When he came to heaven he asked God, ""Why God? Why? I had faith, I prayed, why did you not save me!""

To the Greek, the angel said, ""You engage in perverted sexual practices. You can come back to life only if you remain celibate. We will test you to make sure you comply."" He agrees. 

To the Jew, the angel said, ""Your vice is greed. You can come back to life only if you reform your avaricious ways. But you will be tested."" He agrees.

Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.""
Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

After hearing this the guitar friend made a deal; he'd teach his friend guitar for free if he would also introduce him to the girl. He agreed, and over the next few days the two of them practiced rigorously to the point where the first guy's hands were shaking uncontrollably after practice. Yet no matter how much the first guy practiced he still couldn't play as well as his guitarist friend.

After the two decide that they're ready, they go out and find the girl. They both introduce themselves as guitarists, to which she coyly smiles and asks which one can play better. Without hesitation the two get their guitars and begin playing their absolute best. They continue to play for over an hour while the girl silently stared at them the whole time.

Suddenly she tells the two guitarists to stop and they nearly collapse. The guitarist friend thinks to himself that he has this one in the bag since he clearly played better than his friend. However, the first friend captures the girl's eye as his hands are shaking uncontrollably. 

She then comes up to him, takes his hands, and puts them between her crotch. After a couple of seconds she moans at the top of her lungs, looks at the first friend and says, ""You're PERFECT!""",A guy is struggling to learn how to play the guitar,3

Due to the fact that they were living in a rather remote part of the jungle, these cannibals had run into a rather troublesome problem: there weren't actually that many people for them to eat way out in the middle of nowhere. Therefore they had to rely on eating fruit and small animals for most of their nourishment. Needless to say, this seriously bums them out. 

However, one day, as the two cannibals were walking around, hunting for food, they noticed a missionary who had come to witness to them. Overjoyed, the cannibals crept up on the missionary and hit him over the head with a club, killing him. As they dragged the dead missionary back to their camp for supper, the two cannibals realized that they had a problem: there was only one person to eat. 

After a few moments of arguing, they decided that it would be best to split the missionary between them, deciding that the fairest way to do so, would be if they both started at the man's feet, and ate their way up to his head. 

Having agreed on this, the two cannibals started happily eating the man. 

Several minutes later, as one of the cannibals was eating the man's thigh, he started to feel sick from eating too much. He stopped for a minute and looked to his friend and asked: ""Hey, buddy, how're you doing?""

The second cannibal looked up from his feast and joyously exclaimed: ""Me? Oh, I'm great! I'm having a ball!""

The first cannibal looked at him, panicked. ""Better save one for me! You're eating too fast!""",Two hungry Cannibals living in the jungle . . .,6

And anyway, well, it was a hot summer day and he walking his dog, and he thought he'd stop off at the bar and have himself a beer. And he did just that. He walked into the bar, and he walked up to the bar. And he put his change on the bar, and he said to the bartender, ""I'd like a glass of beer."" And the bartender said, ""Certainly, Sir, coming right up."" Meanwhile, while he was waiting for his beer, he looked down the bar and there was this fellow sitting down the bar with a big black slick mean-looking dog. Now the fellow down the other side of the bar, with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, said ... nothing. But the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog looked down the bar at the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, and said ""hey that sure is an ugly little dog you got there, mister. All short fat squat ugly and yellow."" Well the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said to the guy with the big black sleek mean-looking dog ""yeah, well he may be ugly but he sure can fight.""

And when the fight was over and the big black slick mean-looking dog was over in the corner licking his wounds, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog was hopping around, the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog allowed as, yeah, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog sure could fight. But ... ""I never seen a dog look like that before, all short fat squat little ugly and yellow. What kind of dog is that anyway?""

He's kind of a big fan of the ground beef patties they serve there, alongside bread and sauce. One day a friend decides to visit his town, and the guy is ready to take him to the restaurant once they're all free from other business. He orders the beef patties for both of them and once the waiter brings their food, waits for his friend's review on the food, with a huge smile on his face. To his surprise, the friend pulls out a hair from the patty and is very disgusted. Furious with the incident and feeling very embarrassed, the guy decides to storm into the kitchen , demanding to meet the chef who made their meal. The chef is brought forward. Interestingly the chef is an amputee, with both of his arms amputated. The guy asks the chef how he managed to make ground beef patties without the use of his hands, and the chef shows him by taking off his shirt and using his chest to grind the beef and press it into a circular shape. With the obvious look of shock on the guy's face, the waiter approaches the man and says, ""Amazing huh? You should see how he makes Shish Kebabs, it'll blow your mind""",Friends night out,2

But when Miss Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The Reverend realized she'd had far too much to drink and grabbed her arms to steady her.

She flies past a billboard, behind which is parked a highway patrol officer. Startled by her outrageous velocity, the cop flicks on his lights and siren and pulls out from his hiding spot, tearing up asphalt to close the gap. 

She notices his approach in her rear-view and obeys protocol, pulling over to the side of the road. 

When both cars come to a halt, the officer quickly exits his squad car and makes his way to the damsel. ""What in God's name would make you feel the need to drive so fast, ma'am?!"" he asks her. 

""Well, officer, actually, I'm late for work,"" she replies. 

""And just what is it you do?"" asks the annoyed law enforcer. 

""Well,"" begins the lady, ""I'm a certified Asshole Stretcher.""

""An Asshole Stretcher?!  What the hell does that mean?"" inquires the curious cop. 

""It's quite simple, really,"" says the woman, ""I take my finger and I insert it into a patient's anus. I make sure to use plenty of lubrication during the entire process, as it is very delicate. 

""After I get one finger in, I start to massage the sphincter and get another finger in. Then I can start to make a sort of peace sign, as I insert yet another finger. I work it until I can get knuckle-deep, then I begin to ease my other hand in. 

""Once I get both hands in, I continue to pull and loosen, using plenty of lube, until my whole forearm up to the elbow can wedge inside, and eventually my whole shoulder. I keep working it until I've stretched the asshole to about six feet.""

""Six feet!?"" replies the officer, ""What the hell would you do with a six-foot asshole?!""

The curious thing about the guy who walked in was that his head was, literally, an orange.

Well, this certainly got the attention of the man sitting at the bar. He couldn't help staring. He became even more amazed as the night wore on, watching even more women fawn over the guy with the orange head, and seeing the guy order the most expensive liquor, tossing out wads of cash. 

Finally, curiosity got the best of the man at the bar. When the man with the orange head was alone, he got up from the bar and walked tentatively over to him.

""Excuse me, but I've been watching you all night. I just have to ask: What's your story?""

""Well, here's the thing. A year ago, I  was walking on the beach and stumbled over a lamp. A big genie came out and gave me three wishes.

For the first wish, I said I wanted to be incredibly attractive to women and--POOF!--he made it so.

For the second wish, I said I wanted endless riches and--POOF!--he made it so.

For the third wish--and this is where I fucked up--I said I wanted an orange for a head.""

She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me.""

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""

He lost 33 lbs that week.

They had a father-son bond that couldn't be topped by even the MOST caring parent-child pair.  They shared many adventures together.  From exploring their very own backyard to flying across the country.

John entered third grade, and went through an insect unit.  There, he developed an obsession with bug collecting.  He and his father did everything together, so naturally, they both began collections.  It became sort of a race: ""who could find the biggest bug by the end of the month?"" ""Who could find the biggest bug by the end of the year???""

One day, Siam found an ENORMOUS banana slug the size of his forearm.  The slug seemed to be hyper-intelligent and oddly humane.  John and his father celebrated  the amazing find.  But not long after, Siam was drafted into the army.

Before he left, Siam gifted John with his prized slug.  John, of course, happily obliged, promising to take good care of it.  He named it ""Goo Siam"", after his father.

To pass the time, John and Goo Siam played a lot of poker.  (told you the slug was cool).  John sucked at poker, so the slug always won.  For some reason, they played for money, and by the end, John was 27,000 dollars in debt to the slug.

Finally, his father returned, severely injured, but alive nonetheless.  John had to break the news about the gambling, to which his father responded ""you owe WHAT to Goo-Siam""???!!!!","By the end of this joke, you will have become a bird.",2

The first time they attend the church service, the pastor calls out to the crowd and says that he needs 3 couples to step forward and accept a challenge. The newlyweds decide it would be a good opportunity for them to make some friends and they step forward. In addition to the newlyweds, an elderly couple and a middle-aged couple come up to the stage. 

""Alright listen up."" The pastor says. ""You aren't allowed to have sex for a period of one month. If you succeed you'll be rewarded in the kingdom of heaven. If you fail you'll be kicked out of our church forever. Return in a month and we'll see how you do."" 

A month goes by and the couple returns to the church to tell the pastor how they did. The pastor steps forward and approaches the elderly couple. 

""How'd you guys do?"" He asks. 

""It was easy!"" They reply. ""We only have sex once or twice a year anyway.""

""Excellent!"" Says the pastor. ""You'll be rewarded in heaven."" 

He approaches the middle-aged couple and asks them the same question. 

""We had a couple close calls but in the end we prevailed and resisted the temptation"" replies the husband. 

""Wonderful!"" The pastor exclaims. ""How about you two?"" He asks as he approaches the newlyweds. The husband sighs and looks down at the ground. 

""We were so close. We made it to the second-to-last day but my wife bent over to pick up a can of paint and I just couldn't help myself."" The man says with a sigh.

Suddenly, he gazes upon the most beautiful bronze statue of a siamese cat. He asks the store owner how much he wants for the statue. The store owner replies ""It's $100 for the statue and $1000 for the story that goes with it."" The man replies ""I really don't care about the story, but I do want the statue. As the man is paying for the statue, the shop owner says ""All right, but I guarantee you will be back for the story.""
The man walks out of the shop and starts down the street carrying the cat statue. When he comes to the crosswalk, he happens to glance behind him and sees 3 or 4 cats sitting about 10 feet away, looking at him. He shrugs it off and crosses when the light changes. He goes several more blocks and, at another crosswalk, looks behind himself again. This time there are about 30 cats sitting there looking at him. The man starts to get a little nervous and picks up his pace when the light changes.
By the time the man reaches the pier at the end of the street, he has now been running for several blocks. He was running because every time he turned around, there were more and more cats behind him. He looked like the pied piper. When he got to the end of the pier, he turned around once more and saw at least 10,000 cats sitting there looking at him. There were so many cats that there was no way to get off the pier without going through them and he knew there was no way he was going to do that. In a panic, he turned toward the water and heaved the statue as far as he could. Amazingly, all of the cats ran right past him and jumped in the water after the statue and drowned.
The man, still shaking from his ordeal, immediately started running back to the shop. As he burst through the door, the shop owner saw him and said ""I told you that you would be back for the story.""

The room mate, being a serial procrastinator, puts the paper off till the last night.  When he finally gets to the paper, he realizes there is no way in the world he can finish it. John Smith suggests that he hand in the same paper.  The second student submits the same paper, copied word for word, and also receives an A+ in the class.

For four years, this paper gets passed down, room mate to room mate, and each year, the paper receives an A+.  Everyone assumes that the professor just doesn't notice.  Finally, on the fifth year, a student submits the exact same paper and receives a C-.  

Surprised, he goes to the professor and says, ""Why did I get a C-? I thought my paper was very good.""  

The professor replies that the paper's thesis is simply wrong.  

Incensed, the student snaps, ""But this exact paper has been submitted four times and it got an A+ every time!""

The professor replies, ""Yes, this paper was fantastic when John Smith submitted it 5 years ago and it continued to be fantastic for the next three years.  However, another paper published about six months ago completely invalidates John's hypothesis.  Now, it is only worth a C-"".

After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and the G is out flat. An F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough.

A D comes into the bar and heads straight for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second.""

An A comes into the bar, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor. 

Then the bartender notices a B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and exclaims: ""Get out now! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight.""

The E-flat, not easily deflated, comes back to the bar the next night in a 3-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender (who used to have a nice corporate job until his company downsized) says: ""You're looking sharp tonight, come on in! This could be a major development.""
This proves to be the case, as the E-flat takes off the suit, and everything else, and stands there au natural.

Eventually, the C sobers up, and realizes in horror that he's under a rest.
The C is brought to trial, is found guilty of contributing to the diminution of a minor, and is sentenced to 10 years of DS without Coda at an upscale correctional facility.
On appeal, however, the C is found innocent of any wrongdoing, even accidental, and that all accusations to the contrary are bassless.

The bartender decides, however, that since he's only had tenor so patrons, the soprano out in the bathroom, and everything has become alto much treble, he needs a rest—and closes the bar.

This happened for 3-4 days and everyday the bartender felt humiliated.

Next time, he orders a beer but couldn't find three $1 coins to pay the bill. So, he hands the bartender a $5 note. Now, the bartender gets all excited and thinks that it is his day to avenge the hard time he had because of this man. He then places the two $1 coins at the opposite ends of the table.

Now, with a shrewd smile and with all the excitement he goes to the man and says, ""Go on, collect your change"".

The man then takes out a $1 coin from his pocket and puts it in front of the bartender and says, ""One more beer please.""",A man walks into a bar,1551

He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.
He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""
""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Ferrari.""
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""
So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""
""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""
""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem."" The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 - but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""
""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is..""
As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!"" He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!
Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.

post,6a6ntq,2qh72,jokes,false,1494348839,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6a6ntq/dear_tech_support/,self.jokes,,"* Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, Desperate

* Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command ""! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech Support 

* Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks, Troubled User

* Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes Dear"" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck, Tech Support

post,6a6bae,2qh72,jokes,false,1494345717,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6a6bae/the_curse_of_the_coffin/,self.jokes,,"Three men, Gary, Dan, and Job, grew up together as best friends. They dreamed of one day becoming rich and would do anything to attain wealth. One day, as they were sitting in the local bar, they overheard another group of men discussing the long lost buried treasure of Captain Sleazybeard. The three friends agree that this is their chance to make it big and decide to go together to find this treasure. 

After searching for months deep in the jungle, they come across a cave that they are certain contains the treasure. There are many traps within the cave: poisoned arrows, moats of crocodiles, pits of fire, and rolling boulders, but the three friends are determined to get their wealth. Finally, they reach the deepest part of the cave and it is *filled* with treasure: gold, diamonds, rubies, and more! In the center of the cave is a large sepulchre with the words of a strange language written across it and depictions of death and suffering all along its sides. The three friends paid it no heed and proceeded to fill their pockets and backpacks with treasure. Suddenly the door of the sepulchre burst open and a black, decrepit coffin *floated* out. From out of the coffin arose a  rotting hand holding a large ceremonial dagger. The coffin slowly came towards Gary, Dan, and Job, the hand stabbing at the air as it went. The men let out a shriek, grabbed their bags full of treasure, and ran from the cave. 

Years passed and the three men had enjoyed their newfound wealth, each buying his own luxurious mansion, servants, cars, and whatever they desired. One day, as Gary was staring out of his mansion window, he noticed something on the horizon. It was that coffin with the dreadful hand still stabbing at air, and it was slowly floating toward his home. Gary shouted for the butlers to bar the doors and Gary grabbed his prized elephant gun. The doors didn't stop the coffin though, it plodded right through. Gary shot frantically, but the bullets didn't affect the coffin at all. The coffin stabbed Gary, and the life faded quickly from his eyes.

Dan heard about Gary's death and feared for his own life, so he hired many trained mercenaries as guards to protect him. Soon enough, Dan saw the coffin coming for his luxurious mansion and sounded the alarm. The guards locked all of the doors and opened fire on the coffin, but it didn't stop! Grenades, machine guns, RPGs, none of it could stop the coffin. The guards, seeing the vanity of their efforts, fled in terror. Dan begged and begged for the coffin to stop, but it kept coming. The coffin stabbed Dan right in the heart, and the man fell to the ground lifeless, the white marble floor of his manor now marred by streaks of crimson.

Job, of course, heard of the deaths of his two friends and feared the coffin. He built a large wall of iron around his house, he hired guards, planted landmines, and set traps (he had the money to do so, afterall). When the coffin came, none of it helped. The coffin plowed through the wall, floated over the landmines, was unaffected by the traps, and overpowered the guards. The coffin busted down Job's mansion doors and began making it's way toward him. Job, desperate, began throwing anything he could grab at the coffin: dining room chairs, knives, forks, and even his pet cat (poor Mr. Whiskers!), but the coffin didn't stop. Job fled to his bathroom, hoping the coffin couldn't find him there, but he soon heard the swish of air from the swinging of the coffin's dagger. Before Job could attempt to flee again, the door came crashing down. In one final attempt to save his life, Job opened the bathroom medicine cabinet and threw a package of Halls extra strength lozenges, and the coffin stopped.",The curse of the coffin,487

 As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him
 about, 'What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you
 been? Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'. And on and on and on.
 Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured
 himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the
 bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged
 himself up the stairs.
 While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was
 told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay
 of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight.
 Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to
 go upstairs and give him the good news.
 As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her
 husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet.
 'They're not hanging Wright tonight,' she said.
 He whirled around and screamed, ' DON'T YOU

The first man helped mainly with moving heavy loads. His job mainly consisted of loading building supplies onto carts and pushing them around the site for other workers to use. Sometimes, he would come pulling along a cart full of stuff like bricks and what not, other times he would help lift objects onto higher surfaces, with help of course.

The second man did a load of carrying work. Being quite buff, you'd often see him hauling bags and containers for others. He also operated heavy machinery, mostly dump trucks and what-not. He also chipped in when extra brute manpower was needed.

Both workers were very dedicated to the job and displayed exemplary behaviour. At the end of the month, they collected their salaries.

The first man received $10,000 for his work. The second man got nothing.

""But this is insane! I worked as hard as him, and I get nothing in return? What in the world is this madness!""

The boss simply replied that he was true to his word and paid them all according to how much work he did.

""And when I say work I mean **work** in its truest definition.""

Just as the second man was about to fly into a temper, he was tapped on the shoulder.

""Psss... Look at the wall.""

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. 

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with lorries, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everybody knows Dave,61

St. Peter greets him and stops him from entering. While this man was not a really bad man, neither was he particularly good and St. Peter sends him down to hell. When he gets there, he is greeted by the devil, who tells him that there are three doors to pick from, and he must spend the rest of eternity in the one he chooses.
The devil opens up the first door and the man sees a large room, filled with people, but they are all standing on their heads on a wooden floor. ""Hmm, OK,"" the man says. ""Let me see the second door.""
The devil walks over to the second door and opens it. Inside the man sees a large group of people standing on their heads, but this time, they are on a concrete floor. ""Hmm, OK,"" the man says. ""Let me see the third door.""
The devil walks over to the third door, pulls it open and this time the man sees a large group of people standing around drinking coffee, only they are knee deep in dog shit.
""Choose,"" the devil says.
The man peers into the third room again and makes up his mind. ""Hmm, well, I really like coffee and I don't really mind the smell of dog shit, so I think I'm gonna pick door number three."" 
The man wades in, through the dog shit, and after a minute someone hands him a cup of coffee. A few minutes go by, and suddenly he hears a loud whistle blow and a loud voice booms over the intercom. ""OK assholes, coffee break's over, back on your heads!""",One of my dad's favorites..,53

A traveling salesman arrives in a small farming community and goes to the local motel to get a room for the night. The motel is full but the clerk tells the salesman about a farmer outside of town that rents out the loft above his barn to passersby such as himself. 

The salesman heads out to the farmers place and explains that this area is his new territory and will be by every six months. The farmer agrees to rent out the loft and the salesman sleeps peacefully.  

The next morning he comes down to his car and finds the farmer's lovely young daughters Nelly and Venus leaning against his car. 

""Hey Mister"" says Nelly, ""Wanna go for a ride in my Daddy's new tractor?""

The salesman jumps at the opportunity. The three of them head out and a good time was had by all. 

Six months later, the salesman comes into town as promised. However, he doesn't go straight to the farmers house.  Instead he goes to the motel. The clerk says ""Sure I remember you. Damdest thing, about three months after you left the farmer came in and left you this note.""

The salesman opens the note and it reads:
Dear Sir,

I know that you're the one that did the Pushin' 
Got the grease spots on the cushions
And the footprints on the windshield upside down. 
It's about my daughter Nelly
There's a problem with her belly
So I'd appreciate it if you'd come around. 

The salesman quickly writes a response and gives it to the clerk as he hurries out the door. 

Days later the farmer gets the not and it reads:
Dear Mr Farmer,

Yeah I'm the one that did the pushin'
Got the grease spots on the cushions 
And the footprints on the windshield upside down. 
Well it's about your daughter Venus
See there's a problem with my penis
So I think we'll call it even all around. ",Farmers daughters,2

 Then he saw an envelope propped up
prominently on the center of the pillow.

It was addressed ""Dad"".
With the worst premonition,
he opened the envelope and
read the letter with trembling hands :-

Dear dad,

 It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you,
but I'm leaving home.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend Rosy because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Rosy and she is so nice to me.

I know when you meet her you'll like her too even with all her piercings and tattoos.

But it's not only the passion Dad,
She is pregnant and said that
She wants to have the kid and
that we can be very happy together.

Even though Rosy is much older than me (anyway, 42 isn't so old these days is it?),
and has no money, really these things shouldn't stand in the way of our relationship, don't you agree?

It's true she had other boyfriends as well but I know she'll be faithful to me in her own way.

She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too.

Rosy taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us
and we'll trade it with our friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime,
we'll pray that science will find a
cure for AIDS so Rosy can get better;
She sure deserves it!!

Your loving son,
Rocky.

At the bottom of the page were the letters
""PTO""

Hands still trembling, his father turned the sheet,  and read:

PS: Dad, none of the above is true.
I'm over at the neighbor's house.

I just wanted to remind you that
there are worse things in life than
my report card that's in my desk center drawer.

Please sign it and call when it is safe for me to come home.","Your loving son , Rocky",102

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing.

He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out ""Oh God, help me!""
Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.
Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to now count you as a believer""?

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian""?

""Very well,"" said the voice.
The light went out.
The river ran again.
And the sounds of the forest resumed.
The bear dropped lowered his head, brought both paws together and spoke:

""Lord, please bless this food I am about to receive...""",Atheist in the Woods,27

post,6a14i1,2qh72,jokes,false,1494279343,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6a14i1/hugh_the_blacksmith/,self.jokes,,"So there are three friars living atop a mountain, and they tend to the most beautiful garden in all the land.

One day, one of the friars decides he could make a flower one hundred times prettier than all the other flowers in the garden, if only he could cross-breed a few that he had already.

Now the other friars, being devout Christians, are very upset by this, and excommunicate the first friar for playing God.

Distraught, the first friar packs his bags and gets ready to hike down the mountain. Before he leaves, however, he manages to snag a few of the seeds of this favorite flowers, to remind him of the beautiful garden that he cared about so much.

When he arrives at the village at the foot of the mountain, he's welcomed with open arms. He manages to get a shack for himself where he can live somewhat comfortably.

He plants the seeds in a small planter which he hangs in the one tiny window in his shack, above his bed.

One day, as the friar is getting ready for bed, one of his neighbours stops by. ""Those are the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen!"" he exclaims. ""Would you consider selling me a dozen, once they've bloomed?""

The friar hadn't considered that his florist skills could make him a living. Even though he was okay with his small shack, he would appreciate the extra income. He promises his neighbour that he will sell the flowers once they're ready.

After a few months, the friar has made enough money from selling his flowers that he can afford to move out of his shack, and into a nice cottage near the center of town.

After another few months, the friar's flower shop has developed such a following that all the other florists in town had closed their shops. They simply couldn't compete.

The other florists are incredibly upset by this. ""Who does he think he is, coming down from that mountain and stealing our business!?"" They all get together and decide to ask the friar to close his shop the next morning. 

The next day, they go up to the friar's door and give it three swift knocks. The friar comes to the door right away. He invites them in for tea, and they reluctantly agree.

As they have their tea, the friar tells them his life's story. Growing up in the garden, his love for the flowers, and his eventual excommunication. The other florists are so enamoured with this tale that they leave without asking the friar to move out.

They meet again that night, promising that they'll go back the next day, and this time they WILL get the friar to leave.

Once again, they go up to his door and give three swift knocks. The friar opens the door almost immediately. He once again invites them in for tea.

This time, he tells them the greatest fairy tale that they've ever heard, and they once again leave without asking.

Realizing that they were too weak-willed to ask the friar to leave, they decided to ask the town elders to do it for them. 

The next morning, the town elders accompany the florists down to the friar's house.

After three swift knocks, the prompt opening of the door, and a few rounds of tea, they once again leave empty-handed.

They meet again that night, truly enraged this time. 

""We've tried diplomacy. Three times! We'll have to get this bastard of a friar to leave by force.""

The next day, they go to the strongest man in town, Hugh, the blacksmith.

""Hugh, do you think you could get this friar to leave for us? He's causing us so much trouble!""

They walk down to the friar's shop together. Hugh gives the door three swift knocks, and it opens instantly.

With the reflexes of a cat, Hugh grabs the friar by his collar of his shirt, and carries him out of town while the friar yells profanities.

When Hugh returns to town, he's welcomed with thunderous applause.

""How could you do it, Hugh? He was always too charming for us to ask him to leave.""

Hugh replies, ""Only Hugh can stop florist friars.""",Hugh the Blacksmith,851
