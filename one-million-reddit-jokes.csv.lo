After the loss, the moods were down on the American camp. The executives of the company decided that for publicity reasons they need to win the next years contest. They started a project group to solve the problem. After hard work and long analysis, they concluded that the Japanese had 7 rowers and 1 helmsman, as the Americans had 1 rower and 7 helmsmen.

In this crisis the executives demonstrated great effort: they hired a group of consultants to examine the composition of their team. After months of work, they concluded that the team had too many helmsmen and too few rowers.

Based off the experts report, the executives made immediate modifications to the team. Now they had 4 helmsmen, 2 first officers, team leader and a rower. They also implemented a bonus system to motivate the rower. 

""We have to broaden his job description and give him more responsibility.""

Come the next race, the Japanese won by two miles. American team decided to dismiss the rower on basis of poor performance, but paid bonus to the execs for their hard effort.

However, during his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.


One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Gunnery Sergeant for his personal staff.

The first Master Chief was a Surface Navy type and it was a great interview.

At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

The Master Chief answered, “Why yes. I couldn’t help but notice you are missing your starboard ear, so I don’t know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.”

The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office.

The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, “Well yes, you seem to be short one ear.”

The Admiral threw him out also.

The third interview was with the Marine Gunnery Sergeant . 

He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Master Chiefs put together. 

The Admiral wanted this guy, but went ahead with the same question.

“Do you notice anything different about me?”

To his surprise the Gunnery Sergeant said, “Yes. You wear contact lenses.”

The Admiral was impressed and thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. “And how do you know that?” the Admiral asked.

The Gunny replied, “Well sir, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with only one ear.”","A young Naval Officer was in a terrible car accident, but due to the heroics of the hospital staff the only permanent injury was the loss of one ear.",74

Frustrated, the alien went back to the spacecraft where he was confronted by the captain who wanted a report.

""I contacted an earthling - but he would not cooperate.""

""Hmmm. I will deal with this earthling myself,"" said the captain.

""Yes sir. Be careful sir, I have a feeling there could be trouble.""

The captain left the ship and approached the gas pump. ""Earthling, you will cooperate. Take me to your leader.""

The gas pump remained unresponsive.

""Very well."" The captain drew his blaster. ""If you do not respond by the count of three, I shall be forced to fire on you......One. Two. Three!"" ZZZZZT!

WHAM! The gas pump exploded, knocking the alien ass over tea kettle. The captain jumped up and got back to the ship as fast as his whatever's would propel him.

""Quickly! Make ready to depart!"" shouted the captain.

""Yes sir. What happened sir?""

""I fired on the earthling and it responded very forcefully,"" replied the captain.

""Sorry sir, I was afraid that might happen.""

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.,372

“Well let me tell ya. I was home sick from work and I just got out of the shower. Anyway I walked out onto my balcony of my fifteen floor apartment to get some fresh air. A gust of wind whipped my towel off and I reached out to grab it... but I ended up falling over the edge! Luckily I managed to turn mid-air and grab onto this balcony. So I am hanging there, screaming for someone to help me when this god damn mad man comes running out and starts stamping on my fingers! I then fall ten storeys, but I’m saved! All these branches in these trees at the bottom slowly break my fall. I was just getting my bearings when I look up and a fridge is flying at my face”

Peter nods... perplexed... “wow. Yeah. Okay. That sounds rough, in ya go... next”

This other guy walks up, and Peter says “same as the last two, you’ve had to have had a bad day to get in”

The guy looks at him and goes
“Okay. So imagine this. You’re naked inside a fridge”",God notices heaven is getting a bit crowded,6357

They make a very difficult living on a rocky farm, barely growing enough to survive. It's a hard life, teetering on the edge of disaster.  

They have a cow, and it makes all the difference. She's a great producer of milk, and they are able to trade the milk and cheese to their neighbors for the little things they need.  

One day, at sunrise, Mother wakes and looking out the window, sees the cow laying at the base of a tree. Panicked, she runs out, and sure enough, the cow is lifeless. Distraught, she hangs herself from a tree branch with an apron string.  

Father wakes, and unable to find Mother, is worried, and ventures out to look for her, shotgun in hand. He finds the dead cow, and the body of his wife, and it's too much. He tucks the shotgun under his chin and pulls the trigger.  

The oldest son wakes, sees the carnage, and runs to the stream that runs through the farm, after fetching a length of rope from the barn. He is by the riverbank, with the rope around his neck, tying a boulder with the other end of the rope.  

A beautiful nymph appears. She asks, ""What are you doing?""  

He replies, ""My parents are dead, the cow is dead, and I am going to drown myself.""  

She makes an offer. ""I'm not just a nymph, I am a nympho, too. If you can fuck me three times in an hour, I will bring them all back to life. But if you can't, I will drown you in my stream.""  

The son thinks about it, and agrees. What has he got to lose? He was going to drown himself anyway.  

He fucks the nymph once, no problem. The second time, he struggles, but gets there. The third time, he fails before the hour is up, and she drowns him.  

The middle son wakes, sees his parents and the cow, goes to the stream, and sees his brother dead, too. He takes the rope and ties it to his neck.  

The nymph reappears, and makes the same offer. Same result, the middle son can't make it happen three times within the hour, and she drowns him.  

The youngest son sees the same scenario, and also heads for the stream.  

""I'm not just a nymph, I'm a nympho, and if you can fuck me three times in an hour, I will bring your family back to life.""  

The youngest son looks at her, thinks a moment, then asks, ""What if I fuck you FOUR times in an hour. What then?""  

The nymph, shocked (but excited) replies, ""Why, then I will bring your family back to life, and I will show you where there is a buried treasure worth enough to pay off the debt on the farm.""  

""Sounds good,"" replies the youngest son. ""how about FIVE times?""  

The nymph is astounded. ""I bring your family back to life, you get the buried treasure, AND they discover oil in the back 40.""  

""You've got a deal,"" the son replies, and undresses. The nymph gasps as he removes his pants, and she sees his huge manhood. The son starts toward her, but pauses.  

""What's the matter?"" she asks.  

""Wait a minute,"" he ponders. ""How do I know that fucking you five times in an hour won't kill you...like it killed that stupid cow?""",Not Just A Nymph...But A Nympho [OC] (hopefully),306

He had pulled off many heists and gathered millionsnof dollars. Many of the crimes were known, but the police did not know they were linked, as he used a completely different method each time.

So one day John goes to perform his biggest heist yet. A wealthy casino for the richest of the rich. Now he gets in to the vault and starts bagging the money and the gold. As he goes to leave he hears a commotion on the upper levels. He had been cautious enough not to trip any alarms. So surely it wasn't his robbery causing a commotion. So he proceeds to follow hos escape plan.

When John gets to the exit he is stopped by a police squad. He has no other option other than to surrender and be taken in. John is sentenced with 8 years in a maximum security prison.

Two weeks later John posts his own bail with some of the money from the heists unknown to the cops. And he is free and will be on probation for the next 24 months.

During those two weeks John has become quite famous and is met with a swarm of reporters as he leaves the  prison. As John makes his way through the crowd a man comes up to him and asks ""John! You have just bought your freedom! How do you feel?"" To this, John replies, ""Well after spending a ridiculous amount of money for something I should already have.

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""

post,7gho5r,2qh72,jokes,false,1511997464,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7gho5r/the_sassy_student/,self.jokes,,"When Gandhi was studying law at the University College of London, a white professor, whose last name was Peters, disliked him intensely and always displayed prejudice and animosity towards him. Also, because Gandhi never lowered his head when addressing him, as he expected…. there were always “arguments” and confrontations.

One day, Mr Peters was having lunch at the dining room of the University, and Gandhi came along with his tray and sat next to the professor. The professor said, “Mr Gandhi, you do not understand. A pig and a bird do not sit together to eat.” Gandhi looked at him as a parent would a rude child and calmly replied, “You do not worry professor. I’ll fly away,” and he went and sat at another table.

Mr Peters, reddened with rage, decided to take revenge on the next test paper, but Gandhi responded brilliantly to all questions. Mr Peters, unhappy and frustrated, asked him the following question. “Mr Gandhi, if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with a lot of money, which one would you take?”

Without hesitating, Gandhi responded, “The one with the money, of course.”

Mr Peters, smiling sarcastically said, “I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom, don’t you think?”

Gandhi shrugged indifferently and responded, “Each one takes what he doesn’t have.”

Mr Peters, by this time, was fit to be tied. So great was his anger that he wrote on Gandhi’s exam sheet the word “idiot” and gave it to Gandhi. Gandhi took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move.

A few minutes later, Gandhi got up, went to the professor and said to him in a dignified but sarcastically polite tone, “Mr Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade.”",The sassy student,200

Her husband, Dyl, was always there when she needed him and they both had excellent well-paying jobs.

He was a straight A student, and also JV quarterback, and his parents could not be more proud.  

One day, Samantha came home from an important meeting at work wherein she and her team successfully negotiated the acquisition of a smaller firm. She had bought a bottle of champagne with which to celebrate on the way home. However, upon reaching home, she found Dyl sitting in the living room, his head in his hands.  

""Bad day?"" She asked him.  

""No,"" he answered, ""not particularly. We're ahead of schedule at work and so today was pretty stress free. For me, at least.""  

""Then why do you look so upset?""  

""Well, I didn't have a lot to get done in the office so I came home early. I thought I could surprise Jeff, we could go out for some father/son bonding time when he got home.""  

""I take it that didn't happen.""  

""No,"" answered Dyl, ""when Jeff got home, I went to give him a hug, but he wouldn't even look me in the eye. He just stormed off to his bedroom and has been blasting Nirvana for the past three hours.""

Now, some people have to work hard to get good at things, and some people are just naturals.  Our little boy here...well, let's just say he was a natural.  After 15 mind-blowing minutes he and the woman lay panting in bed.

""Wow,"" she said,""that was the best sex I've ever had.  I...I loved it.  I want to go again.""

""Ok,"" said the little boy, ""but in that case I want my duck back.""

The woman readily agreed, and they made passionate love for another round.  Finally spent, the little boy collected his duck and left her apartment.  As he turned to close the door, however, the duck ran away and right into oncoming traffic -- where it was struck by a passing truck.  The man in the truck screeched to a halt, and jumped out, but there was no saving the duck.

""I'm so sorry,"" the man said,""it was totally an accident.""

""That's ok,"" the little boy replied, ""he only cost a dollar anyways.""

""Well let me reimburse you,"" the man said, ""it's the least I can do.""

So the man gave the little boy a dollar, and the little boy proceeded home to his mother.

""Did you spend your dollar?"" his mother asked.

""I did,"" he replied.

""Well, what did you get?""

""I got a duck for a buck, a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and a buck from a guy in a truck for a fucked up duck.""",A woman gave her little boy a dollar and told him to go spend it wisely,3701

Johnny says "" I've been watching that young female gorilla on the other side of the island"". Bill says ""Yeah me too and I've got a plan. We'll feed her a bunch of those berries that you tried that made you pass out last week and well have our way with her."" Johnny says ""Yeah that'll be great. We'll take turns with her."" ""Ok"". 


So they gather a bunch of berries and bananas and mix them in a bucket and set the bait out at the beach.   The wait an hour behind some bushes and sure enough she wanders out to investigate the smell and starts eating.  About the time she finished it all, she lays down to sleep.  The guys run out with ropes and stakes. They put four stakes down and tie her by her hands and feet.  


The guys stand back and eye up their ""woman"". Johnny says ""Ohh I can't do it. She smells to bad."" Bill said ""I though about that too.""  Bill runs down to the water with the bucket and fills it up. He runs back and pours the water all over her.  Johnny says ""Well she smells a little better but she is so ugly. I just can't do it."" Bill says ""I thought of that too and puts the bucket on her head.""


Johnny gets down on his knees and starts fucking her. After a minute he starts really getting into it. After another minute the gorilla starts to wake up. As Johnny is working up a sweat the gorilla breaks one arm free and then the other and has Johnny in a real grapple.

The moth sighs and says, “Well...it’s my job. I’ve been at the mill for nigh on two decades and I have begun to feel like I’m just plugging along waiting for the end. I’m still working toward something, but I thought by the time I got to be this age I’d have actually achieved something. Instead I’m still practically in the same place I was in my youth professionally, and that makes it very hard to stay motivated.” 

“Oh wow,” says the pediatrist, “that sounds terrible. I’m so sorry.”

“It gets worse,” says the moth. “My wife and I, we’ve been married 28 years, raised two children, and now in the dust of our whirlwind of bills, ballet classes, family dinners, and tight funds I’ve realized I go to bed every night next to a complete stranger. The woman I fell in love with and married is long gone, and in her place is this tired, reserved old woman. I can’t even explain it to her because I feel guilty knowing she must feel the same way about me. We’ve both changed and grown farther apart. I thought for a while she was having an affair. I started to get angry but then I realized I was actually happy for her. She deserves to feel wanted and I just can’t do that for her anymore.”

“Jesus,” says the pediatrist. “This is heavy stuff, buddy.”

“There’s still more,” says the moth, who is now sobbing. “My daughter is in college and she never comes home for her breaks. She always makes some excuse but I know it’s because our life offers no excitement or warmth for her. Truth be told...I don’t even miss her. I’m happy she’s gone living her life, and every time I see her I think about how in just a few short years she’ll be just as disappointed with her life as I am. I don’t want to remind her of the inevitability of growing old. And my son, he’s a junior in high school. I can already feel him heading down the same path I did- life long labor job, lower middle class lifestyle, average wife and average children. He has no drive and no ambition, but in reality those things won’t save you from the hard truth of the world. I’m sad that he won’t amount to anything, but I’m proud of his realism in a sick way. Ultimately I’m lost, empty and wandering through the golden years of my life with no real emotions or passion. I’m patiently waiting to die and every day that passes, every morning that comes where I wake up alive, the idea of ending it all myself becomes more attractive. Does that make sense?”

“Mother of god, man!” cried the pediatrist. “You’ve got some serious issues to work through! You need a therapist! Why on earth did you come see me? I’m just a pediatrist?”

In preparation, Santa had the elves wash the sled and bathe all the reindeer. Santa got his logbook out and made sure all his paperwork was in order. He knew they would examine all his equipment and truly put Santa’s flying skills to the test…

The examiner walked slowly around the sled. He checked the reindeer harnesses, the landing gear, and Rudolph’s nose. He painstakingly reviewed Santa’s weight and balance calculations for the sled’s enormous payload.

Finally, they were ready for the checkride. Santa got in and fastened his seatbelt and shoulder harness and checked the compass. Then the examiner hopped in carrying, to Santa’s surprise, a shotgun.

“What’s that for?!?” asked Santa incredulously.

The examiner winked and said, “I’m not supposed to tell you this ahead of time,” as he leaned over to whisper in Santa’s ear, “but you’re gonna lose an engine on takeoff.”",Santa's pre-Christmas flight check,2

'He's 85 years old,' says Kim Lee. 'He practiced Chi-kung with me this morning, and thereafter went to the beach for a walk.  He drank Pu Urh tea and that's why he's still active.'

'Well....' the doctor says, 'that's great, but I'm sure there's more to it than that. How about your Father's Father? How old was he when he died?'

'Who said my grand dad is dead?'

Stunned, the doctor asks, 'you mean you're 65 years old and your grandfather's still living? Incredible!! How old is he?'

'He's 101 years old,' says the old Chi-kung master.

The doctor is getting frustrated at this point, 'So, I guess he went practicing Chi-kung with you this morning too?'

'No! No! No! He couldn't join us this morning because he's getting married today.'

At this point, the doctor is close to losing it. 'Getting married? Why would a 101 year old guy want to get married?'

'He does not want to get married but he has to as THE GIRL IS PREGNANT!!'

post,7g8o84,2qh72,jokes,false,1511912783,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7g8o84/there_was_a_church/,self.jokes,,"Sometime around the 1950’s, there was a small village in a remote region somewhere in the American South, and at the center of this village was a tall church. 

As most churches of this period, this church had, as its crowning glory, a tall bell tower. The jewel of the crown was, naturally, a large brass bell. 

An elderly woman from the church had been pulling the rope to ring the bell every Sunday since before anyone could remember.  She had a special technique that made an exceptionally pleasant sound. 

That is, until her untimely death at the age of 89. Thus began the process of finding a new employee to faithfully ring the church bell week after week. 

An ad was placed in the regional newspaper by the church secretary, and, much to everyone’s surprise, many people applied.

After narrowing down the applicants to the top five, the secretary took each to try their hand at ringing the giant bell. 

Each pulled the rope with gusto, and the bell chimed and rang like any bell would. Unfortunately, none of them could make it sound half as good as the elderly woman had. 

Disappointed, the church secretary sent the applicants away. Just as she was ready to begin the whole process again, she heard a knock on the church office door. 

In walked the ugliest, most mangled-faced man she had ever seen. Gasping at his pure hideousness, she caught her breath and asked, “May I help you?”

“I am here to apply for the job of ringing that bell, ma’am.”

“Well, OK. Let’s see what you can do.”

The two of them walked over to the bell rope, but the ugly man asked if they could climb up the tower, and ring it from inside the top of the tower!

The secretary obliged, and the two climbed the steep steeple stairway to the top. 

The man examined the bell, took a few steps back, ran up and SMASHED HIS FACE straight into the bell...

...and it made the most beautiful sound that anyone in the village had ever heard. 

Wiping away a small tear brought on by the sheer loveliness of the sound, the secretary told the man he had the job. 

For the next few months, Sunday after Sunday, the mangled-faced man would take few steps back, run up, and smash his face into the bell. And every week, the sound was so wonderful that the village folk would stop whatever they were doing to listen. 

Church attendance was growing larger than ever, and the secretary was more than pleased with the new employee. 

Then, on Easter Sunday, the ugly man decided to make the sound extra special and louder than ever. 

So he took a step back...

...and an extra step for more speed...

...and just one more tiny extra step back, and...

...

...

...he lost his footing, tumbling backwards out of the bell tower. 

He landed with a thud on the sidewalk below. Dead as a door nail. 

The townsfolk gathered around, distraught at their misfortune. 

“What was his name?”
“Does anyone know his name?”
“Someone get the church secretary. She hired him. Surely she knows his name!”

So they bring the church secretary to identify the poor man. 

She finally breaks through the crowd, takes a long sad look at him and says...

“Well, I don’t know his name...

...but his **face rings a bell**.”




———————————

If that wasn’t torture enough, there’s a Part II ;)

———————————



So, after the trauma of losing the most amazing musician anyone had ever heard, and the obligatory three week mourning period for bell-ringers, the church secretary decided its time to begin the search for a new employee. 

The ad, once again, gets a fair amount of attention. Several candidates are brought in, but none can even hold a candle to the dead nameless ugly man. 

The secretary is about to give up hope completely when, lo and behold, there’s a knock on the office door. 

Like a blast from the past, in walks an even uglier, more mangled faced man. 

“Hi ma’am, I’m here to apply for the job of bell ringer. I actually have a family history of unique church bell ringing.”

“Well, you do remind me of our last bell ringer...”

“Oh, he was my brother, George!”

“Well sir, let’s go see what you can do.”

The two, just like last time, climb the steep steeple stairs. The uglier man takes a few steps back, runs up, and SMASHES HIS FACE directly into the bell. 

As unlikely and unbelievable as it may seem, the sound was even more wonderful and beautiful than his brother. 

You know the story... 

4th of July rolls around, the uglier man wanted to make a bigger and better ringing than anyone had ever heard. 

So he took a step back...

...and an extra step for more speed...

...and just one more tiny extra step back, and...

...

...

...you guessed it. He lost his footing, tumbling backwards out of the bell tower. 

He landed with a thud on the sidewalk below. Dead. Door Nail style. 

Once again, the townsfolk gathered around, distraught at their continued misfortune. 

“What was THIS guy’s name?”
“Does anyone know his name?”
“Someone get the church secretary. She hired him. Surely she got his name this time!”

So they bring the church secretary to identify yet another poor dead man. 

She finally breaks through the crowd, takes one look at him and says...

“Well, I never asked his name, 

But he’s a **dead ringer** for his brother George.”",There was a church...,34

During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates. The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time. After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area. Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community... and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over. 

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself. But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife. So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him. 

But, alas, Andy refused. He told the warden, ""Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.""

The draw was done in a large stadium, watched by millions of people. First the third prize was drawn; a first class ticket around the world on Air India, the winner was pretty happy with this. Then the second prize was drawn; a fruit cake. The winner was not happy, he complained that the third prize was better, and normally one would expect the second to be larger than the third.

The pilot grabs his microphone and announces to the passengers,

""Hello passengers, this is your captain speaking. As I'm sure some of you have noticed, one of the engines is sputtering black smoke and we are losing altitude at a somewhat alarming rate. I want to assure you that I have no intention of crashing into the mountains, so in an effort to remain in the sky we are going to dump the cargo to lighten the airplane. Once we are done, we will assess if further action is necessary. Thank you for flying with us today.""

Under the pilot's orders, the flight crew empties the cargo hold of the plane. Unfortunately, while the plane is falling more slowly, it's not enough. The pilot addresses the passengers again,

""Hello passengers, this is your captain speaking. We have successfully offloaded the cargo from the aircraft but unfortunately we are still losing altitude too quickly to make it to the nearest landing site. The only thing left we have to let go of is people- now, I want everyone to remain calm. My co-pilot and I have determined a fair way to select volunteers to equip parachutes and we are broadcasting drop locations with our distress call, rescue crews will come for you soon. Without further ado, it pains me to ask... The first letter is A, so would all the African Americans please make your way to the flight crew where they will escort you to the cargo bay for departure.""

The older man remains seated, while his grandson sulkingly starts to stand.

""Sit down, boy,"" his grandfather says.
""But grandpa, we're African Americans.""
""I said sit down, boy.""

After a few monents the captain comes back on,

""Hello passengers, this is your captain speaking. We're making progress. Next is B, would the Black folks please make their way to the cargo bay for departure. Rescue crews will be on the way to you momentarily.""

The little boy goes to stand again, but his grandfather sternly says to him,
""I said sit down, boy. How many times I got to tell you?""
""But grandpa,"" he protests, ""We're black!""
""Sit down and shut your mouth, I mean it."" Confused, the boy sits again. After a few moments, the captain comes back on, 

""Hello passengers, this is your captain speaking. Every brave soul is a hero, and we need more heroes. C is up next, would all the Coloured people please make their way to the cargo bay for departure. Thank you.""

The boy, once again, stands up.

""I said sit your ass down boy! Don't make me say it again or I will wear your ass out right here right now!
""BUT GRANDPA!"" The boy shouts, ""Aren't we African American, Black, AND Coloured?""

Without skipping a beat his grandfather grabs him by the shoulders and stares straight into his eyes as he says,

Reunion is when you get up in the morning and tell your wife you are going to work. 

Instead you go to your neighbour's wife to make love to her. 

Her husband comes and knocks on the door. 

You go under the bed. 

The husband enters the bedroom. 

Feeling uneasy, the wife excuses herself  to go to market to buy food items. 

The husband takes advantage of the wife's absence to call your wife. 

Your wife quickly arrives and they make love. 

Suddenly his wife who had excused herself  to go to the market turned back halfway forgetting the list of food items at home and knocks  on the door. 

You're still under the bed. 

Your wife rushes to hide under the bed.

But being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later he called the National Weather Service again. ""Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's going to be a very cold winter.""

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later the Chief called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

post,7g3mpp,2qh72,jokes,false,1511869940,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7g3mpp/dinner_with_the_pope/,self.jokes,,"An elderly Priest of a small village by the sea is going to do some fishing one day.  Fishing relaxes him and he has cause to be anxious.  The Pope himself is coming to his humble parish for a visit and will be dining that very evening with him and the parish Nun.

As the priest makes his way through the small township with his fishing rod slung over his shoulder he happens upon a local boy that he knows well, Timmy....

“Father are you going to do a bit of fishing?”

“It just so happens that I am Timmy, would you care to join?”

Timmy agrees and the priest and the lad set out on a small boat.  While out on the boat the priest begins to cast his line out on the open water...

“No father, cast your line that way”

Timmy points the opposite direction.

“That’s where all the fish are, trust me”

The Priest decides to take the boys advice and casts his line in the direction that Timmy recommended.  No sooner had the line hit the water than the priest felt an almighty tug of the line and an hour long battle ensued resulting in the priest, with Timmy’s help of course, landing a massive fish the like of which he had never seen before!

“Praise the lord Timmy this fish is humongous!”

“That certainly is a big fucker”

Timmy said without a hint of mischief.

“TIMMY! I cannot believe you would use that kind of filthy language at all, never mind when in the presence of an elderly clergyman!”

A look of puzzlement followed by recognition crossed Timmy’s young features and he eventually chuckled.

“No father you mis understand me!  That particular fish is called a Phucker fish, spelled P H U C K E R. I apologise for the confusion but I swear to god it is so”

They both had a hearty laugh at the mix up and decided to call it a day.  The priest began his short walk back up the hill to his parochial house with the massive fish over his shoulder feeling a lot calmer after his exertion and after finding a solution as to what to serve the Pope that very evening for dinner.

Upon entering the grounds of his home he was greeted enthusiastically by sister Murphy who had spotted his approach with the extra large fish.

“What a rare size of a fish you have caught father! Well done, it is perfect for supper with the Pope tonight”

Beaming with pride at his accomplishment the priest said....

“ I know it’s a big Phucker isn’t it sister!”

Sister Murphy was shocked and offended by this statement and told the priest so..

“Father not only am I a woman, I am a woman of the Cloth!  And you a man of God,  to hear such bile hateful utterances spewing from your lips blackens my pious heart!”

The priest immediately saw that he was guilty of exactly the same oversight as Timmy and rushed to explain himself...

“Sister I’m sorry but you have me all wrong!  The name of this particular species of fish is the P H U C K E R fish, it sounds rude but believe me it’s merely it’s scientific name”

Satisfied and relieved the Nun sighs loudly and says..

“ oh i see, well give it to me and I’ll gut the Phucker so the Cook can prepare it for this evening”

The Nun was as good as her word and brought the sizeable fish freshly gutted to the church Cook.

“Sister I believe that may be the biggest fish I have ever seen with my own two eyes!  I will prepare a feast for his holiness tonight!”

Sister Murphy handed the fish over and said conversationally...

“I know Cook, the father, little timmy and I all agree it’s an impressive big Phucker”

The chef making the same understandable assumption as the priest and the Nun had that day was dumbfounded and eventually said...

“Sister Murphy, Jesus would weep if he heard such low grade gutter talk coming from a sworn lady of the habit! How dare you besmirch his holy soul in his own house!”

Sister Murphy scolding herself as a fool for making the same faux pax as the priest and Timmy. Explained to the Cook..

“No Cook I am sorry for the confusion, I too thought as you did that the Priest was swearing like a rotten two bit sailor, but alas the name of this breed of fish is a PHUCKER fish!  Accept my sincere apologies”

The Cook was instantly relieved.

“ ah now it makes sense!  Give me that fish here and I’ll cook the Phucker”

That evening everything was set.  The table was resplendent in the finest silver the parish had to offer, the finest wine decanted, candles tastefully lit and the Pope was comfortable and already praising the aromas wafting from the kitchen.  He sat at the head of the table with the Priest on one side of him and Sister Murphy on the other.  He was enjoying a cigar and a Brandy when the Cook came out with the main course beautifully prepared and steaming hot on a silver platter adorned with vegetables and spices. 

The Pope was noticeably impressed...

“ praise the Lord I have never seen such a large nor beautifully presented fish in all my years”

The Priest, Nun and Cook were so happy with the praise from such a holy servant of God and they each spoke in turn.

The Priest said...

“I caught the Phucker”

The Nun said.....

“I gutted the Phucker”

Lastly the Cook said...

“And I cooked the Phucker”

The Pope was silent for a few seconds looking contemplative.  After a while he reclined in his seat, took a sip of his brandy and a long pull of his cigar, blew out the smoke and said.....

“You know what?......you Cunts are alright”

They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.

The physicist said ""We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed"".

""Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!"" 

The man is again impressed and lets the bird finish his song. At this point, the man is very interested in purchasing the bird, but he wants to know if Chet has any more tricks up his sleeve, so he asks the owner

"" What happens if you put the match between his legs?"" 

The owner looks slightly intrigued himself this time, ""You know, I have never tried"" So he moves the match and Chet once again begins to sing:

""Chet's nuts roasting, on an open fire!""

By next Wednesday, his new composition was complete. His band was tuning their instruments and getting ready to preform. As his band started to play, they all played out of sync, to Kim's displeasure. So, not being the forgiving type, Kim sent him to be executed. When the conductor was asked what he'd like his last meal to be, he said ""a spicy curry, hot as can be!"" So he ate the curry, eyes tearing up. He was then taken to the electric chair to be executed. Kim turned on the chair. Sparks flew and smoke filled the room. The conductor was completely unharmed. Kim, being impressed by this, gave him another chance to preform. He started composing right away, this time, his masterpiece. The time comes for him to preform, and his band absolutely blows it. Kim, once again annoyed by this, sends him to be executed once again. When asked what he'd like his last meal to be, he said ""The spiciest curry on the planet!"" So he ate the curry, sweating and eyes tearing up. He was sent to the electric chair. Kim turned it on, Sparks flew and smoke filled the room. The conductor was once again unharmed. Kim, still being impressed by this, gave the conductor one final chance to prove himself. He started conducting his song, greater than the world's ever seen.

This fisherman was famous throughout the world for being able to catch numerous amounts of fish in any body of water. Now, fish these days have mutated and changed quite a bit, but this fisherman was able to catch them all with little to no effort.

One day, a businessman comes up to him and asks him for a favor: “Can you catch me some of those delicious trout lurking in the Mariana Trench? Now most trout nowadays are found in freshwater, but in the year 2200, the trout have developed mechanisms to survive in extremely high water pressures as well as a saltwater environment. The fisherman nonchalantly agreed, charged the regular fee and set out on his tiny boat. He climbed into his submarine, dove down 200 km (127 freedom units), and launched his brilliantly designed fishing net. With flawless maneuvering and steering, he would have cleared out almost the entire trench if he wasn’t limited by the size of the net and the ascent speed of his submarine. At the end of the day, he gathered enough trout to feed the small city for a day.

The next week, the same businessman comes up to the fisherman and asks him for another favor: “Can you catch me some of those rare piranhas in the Nile?”. Now, piranhas nowadays are known for their sharp teeth, but in the year 2200, they’ve evolved so that their teeth are even sharper than before, capable of tearing through rock. They also became much more aggressive and will attack practically anything that falls in the water. They invaded the Nile after an accident at a zoo. The fisherman, however wasn’t fazed. He bought a ticket to Egypt with the wealth that he has acquired. He put his iron-clad boat into the river and set out his titanium-wired net. Once again, he almost cleaned out the entire river in one day, and gathered enough fish to feed the small city for two days. 

One month later, the businessman comes up to the fisherman AGAIN and asks him for the biggest favor yet. “No one has been able to capture any of the polar salmon! If you get these, we’ll be set for life!”. The fisherman has never had any intention to go to the Arctic before, as he dislikes cold weather, but with his reputation and pride on the line, he sets out to capture this elusive fish. Compared to the other two, this should be the easiest, as the salmon lurks around the surface of the water and are not dangerous to handle. However, the fisherman tried and tried but was unable to catch these salmon. He tried upgrading the motor of the boat, the power output of the arm controlling the net, acquiring better bait, but none of it worked. The fish would always find someway to escape, and would never approach any bait that was set out. The fisherman never got close. Just when he was about to give up, he saw an old man fishing with an old wooden rod next to his igloo. Next to him was a sizeable amount of polar salmon. Astounded, the fisherman walked up to the man.

“How were you able to catch these salmon? I tried baiting them, but they wouldn’t come. I tried running them down, but it’s as if all of them know where I am before I even get close to them!”

The old man replied: “I see you’re new around these parts. When the ice caps melted, a huge iron repository was found, and it contaminated the water. The salmon migrated here and the iron fused in the salmon’s nervous system. They have their own internal magnet now and can sense the electromagnetic fields radiating out of your electronically powered net. The old man lent the fisherman an old wooden net and taught him the best places to find the salmon.

In short, Net Neutrality is Important.

It booms “You have finally freed me after all these years, so I’ll grant each one of you 3 wishes.” The first guy immediately blurts out “I want a billion dollars.” POOF, he’s holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says “I want to be the richest man alive.” POOF, he’s holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says “I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.” POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it’s time for their second wish. First guy says: “I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.” POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says “I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.” POOF, his looks change and the first guy’s wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says “I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.” POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says “I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.” POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don’t bother him any more. Second guy says “I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.” POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says “My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.” POOF, he’s now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: “I’ve invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I’ve never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.” Second guy smiles and says “Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I’m still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven’t aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.” Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:
