""Well,"" Harry says, ""I just went bankrupt and I've still got to feed my family. I don't know what I'm going to do.""

""Could have been worse,"" James replies calmly. ""Could have been worse.""

""Terrible!"" says Harry. ""Our house burned down last night.""

""Could have been worse,"" says James, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.


A month later, James runs into Harry a third time. ""Well, how goes it?"" he inquires.

""Oh!"" says Harry. ""Things just get worse and worse. It's one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!""

Harry nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: ""Could've been worse.""
 
This time, Harry grabs James by the shoulders. ""Wait a minute!"" he says. ""I'm not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past few months we've run into one another, and every time I've told you the latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: 'Could have been worse.'

So here's the story. . .

Tired of constantly being broke &amp; stuck in an unhappy marriage, a 
young husband decided to solve both problems by taking out a large 
insurance policy on his wife with himself as the beneficiary, and then 
arranging to have her killed.

A 'friend of a friend' put him in touch with a nefarious dark-side 
underworld figure who went by the name of 'Artie.' 
Artie then explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing 
out a spouse was $5,000.

The husband said he was willing to pay that amount, but that he 
wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's 
insurance money.

Artie insisted on being paid at least something up front, so the man 
opened his wallet, displaying the single dollar bill that rested 
inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, &amp; reluctantly agreed to accept the 
dollar as down payment for the dirty deed..

A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Super 
Wal-Mart store. There, he surprised her in the produce department &amp; 
proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands as the poor 
unsuspecting woman drew her last breath &amp; slumped to the floor........

The manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly 
onto the murder scene. Unwilling to leave any living witnesses behind, ol' 
Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

However, unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured 
by the hidden security cameras &amp; observed by the store's security guard, 
who immediately called the police. Artie was caught &amp; arrested before he 
could even leave the store.

Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the 
whole sordid plan, including his unusual financial arrangements with 
the hapless husband who was also quickly arrested..

The next day in the newspaper, the headline declared ...

(You're going to hate me for this ... )

'ARTIE CHOKES 2 for $1.00 AT WAL-MART!'",Murder @ Wal-Mart,1000

So, he's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","A horse is bored, so he's sitting at home watching MTV",648

As I worked my way through the test, I came to the free response questions. The first question was something about projectile motion involving an object fired from a cannon. It said to solve it and draw a representation.

I'm not much of an artist, so I draw two wheels and a shaft. I think that this is probably good enough.

Then the sub who is walking around stops at my desk. She stands there for a few seconds, looks at me, and then keeps walking.

Why did she stop at my desk?

I look at my paper and realize that my cannon does not look like a cannon. It's a dick. I frantically begin thinking about how to fix it and make it more cannon like. I decide that I should add texture to the wheels to help distinguish it.

In my head, the cannon wheels were made of stone. So to show this, I draw little squiggles all over the wheels. Perfect.

Nope. Now it has ball hair and the sub is walking back towards my desk.

I desperately think about what to do, before deciding that I should color it black. Cannons are usually black.

I shade it all in, but now it just looks like a black one.

The sub passes my desk again.

I decide to round the wheels a bit more and call it good. It looks kind of like a cannon now. I continue reading the problem and realize that I need to draw the projectile.

I draw a circle to suggest a cannonball. This is perfectly fine, but now I decide that I am an artist and I need to show motion.

I put two motion lines behind the ball that connect to opposite sides of the cannonball and stem from the cannon.

Now it appears to be jizzing all over.

I give up.

I write ""This is a cannon"" and have an arrow point to my beautiful drawing. I continue on with the test.",Physical Science Test,4

Out of embarrassment, she insisted that the surgery be kept secret and, of course, the surgeon agreed. 

Awakening from the anesthesia, she found 3 roses carefully placed beside her on the bed.

Outraged, she immediately called in the surgeon. 

""I thought I specifically asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!""

The surgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him. ""I felt so sad for you, because you went through this all by yourself.""

""The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery and understood perfectly, as she had the same procedure done some time ago.""


""And what about the third rose?"" she asked.

""Oh, that's from a man in the burn unit - he wanted to thank you for his new ears.""",Plastic surgery . . .,7

The friends look at each other for a moment... laugh and continue with their conversation. 

A few more minutes pass and the old man let's out a sudden grunt, shocking everyone. He turns to the table of friends, looks at the same guy and shouts, ""Your mama is so ugly, her blowjobs count as ANAL!"" 

The friends all look at each other a little concerned, but carry on with their drinks and conversation anyway. 

A few more minutes pass and suddenly the old man jumps up onto his table, spraying his beer everywhere. He points at the same guy and shouts,"" YOUR MAMA IS SO UGLY, EVEN HER DILDO NEEDS VIAGRA!!"" 

The group of friends can't believe their ears. Just as one of them is about to say something, the old man continues... 

""Your mama is so fucking stupid, she threw a rock at the ground and missed!! She is sooooo fat, she was diagnosed with a flesh eating disease and the doctor gave her 80 years to live! She's so DUMB!! HA, she got STABBED in a SHOOTOUT!! She's so fucking FAT, her blood type is RAGUUU!!!""

He takes a deep breath, a swig of ale and continues... 

""She's sooooo dumb, she spent 20 minutes staring at an orange juice carton coz it said 'concentrate'. Ya mum's so fat, she walked infront of the TV and I missed all 3 Lord of the Rings films! Your MUMMA is so naaasty, I stuck a cucumber in her and pulled out a pickle... She's so slutty, she got fired from the spermbank for drinking on the job! Your mama is so hideous, the water jumps out of the pool before she even jumps in. Yo mama is sooooo fat, after sex I roll over twice and I'M STILL ON THE BITCH! Your mother is so disgusting...""

""ENOUGH!"" the guy shouts. The whole pub is deadly silent. 

He slowly walks up to the old guy, looks him dead in the eye and says,"" go home Dad, you're drunk"".",A group of friends walk into a bar and order a round of drinks.,171

""Oh boy"" Says the fly ""If I drop just six inches I'll be able to feel the cooling mist of the river and take a break!""

However, little does the fly know that there is a fish hiding just beneath the water. The fish thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops just six inches, I'll be able to jump up and eat the fly!""

Unbeknownst to the fish, there is a bear hiding in the bushes by the bank of the river. He sees the fly and the fish and thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches then the fish will jump for the fly, and then I can run out and catch the fish!""

Hidden from the bear up in a treestand, is a hunter. He sees the fly, the fish and the bear just poking out of the bushes and he thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run to catch the fish, and then I can get a shot at the bear!""

There's a sandwich in the hunter's pocket, but it's hanging precariously in such a way that a mouse, cowering behind the hunter thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run for the fish, the hunter will lean forward to shoot the bear, the sandwich will fall out of his pocket and then I can eat the sandwich!""

Above the mouse, higher in the tree is a cat. He spies the fly, the fish, the bear, the hunter, the sandwich and the mouse and thinks to himself ""Oh boy, this is purrrfect. If that fly drops six inches then the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run to catch the fish, the hunter will lean forward to shoot the bear, the sandwich will fall out of his pocket, the mouse will come out into the open to grab the sandwich and then I'll be free to pounce on the mouse!"" 

SO!

The fly decides to go for it, he drops six inches to feel the mist of the river. The fish leaps out of the water to nab the fly, the bear barrels out of the bushes to grab the fish, the hunter leans forward and pulls the trigger causing the sandwich to fall out of his pocket, the mouse rushes out to nibble at the sandwich and the cat, startled by the gunshot, jumps, misses and then falls into the river...

Now what's the moral of the story?

He tells the rancher, ""I need to inspect your ranch for illegally grown drugs.""

The DEA officer verbally explodes saying, ""Mister, I have the authority of the Federal Government with me."" 

Reaching into his rear pants pocket, he removes his badge and proudly displays it to the rancher. 

""See this badge? This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish.... On any land.. No questions asked or answers given. Have I made myself clear? Do you understand? "" 

The rancher nods politely, apologizes meekly, and goes about his chores. 

A short time later, the old rancher hears loud screams and sees the DEA officer running for his life chased by the rancher's big Santa Gertrudis Bull... 

With every step the bull is gaining ground on the officer, and it seems likely that he'll get gored before he reaches safety. 

The officer is clearly terrified. 

The rancher throws down his tools, runs to the fence and yells at the top of his lungs...

Madame: OK fine. Let me get a lineup and you can pick out the one you want to have fun with

Johnny: Don't worry about that, I got it all figured out. I want a girl with diseases.

Madame: I have a girl with diseases, but i don't think you want her. Let me get a lineup and you can get one of my good girls

Madame: OK fine. I'll take you to Jenny's room and you can have fun with her

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

When mother and new baby came home from the hospital, Johnny's family was invited over to see the baby. Before they left their house, Little Johnny's dad had a talk with him and explained that the baby had no ears.

His dad also told him that if he so much mentioned anything about the baby's missing ears or even said the word ears, he would get the smacking of his life when they came back home.

Little Johnny told his dad he understood completely. When Johnny looked in the crib he said: ""What a beautiful baby."" The mother said, 'Why, Thank you Johnny."" Johnny said: ""He has beautiful little feet, beautiful little hands, a cute little nose and really beautiful eyes. Can he see all right?""

""Yes"", the mother replied, ""we are so thankful; the Doctor said he will have 20/20 Vision.""

""That's great"", said Little Johnny, ""cos he'd be fucked if he needed glasses!""",Little johnny still didn't shut up..........,131

You should know we give you the choice of whether you want to spend eternity in heaven or in hell.” “How do I know which one to pick?” the politician replies. “We let you spend a day in each, and then you may decide.” The politician agrees and is sent to the heavenly realm first.

The experience is okay. He mostly sits around on the clouds singing and playing the harp, and exchanging some pleasant conversation with the angels. He goes back to Peter the next day, and is sent to hell this time.

The elevator arrives at the bottom, and the doors open. He is in a beautiful garden, it’s sunny, and there is a nearby golf course. A bar in the pristine looking garden keeps the drinks flowing: beer, cocktails, wine, whiskey, whatever the heart could imagine. There is also a buffet. All his friends and family that have passed away are there, and they greet him cheerfully. Even Satan is there, and he ends up being a really nice and cool guy who assists the politician in whatever he can. After chatting with them for awhile, the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen comes to him, and they end up having the best sex he has ever experienced.

At the end of the day, the politician goes back to St. Peter. “I hope you enjoyed the tryouts sir. What do you choose, heaven or hell?” The politician replies “well Peter to be honest heaven is great and all, but I really enjoyed hell a lot more. I’d like to go there.”

His wish is granted. When the elevator doors open in hell, he is greeted by horror. The whole place is dark and gloomy, his friends are screaming as they are burning in pits of fire, and demons walk around beating with pitch forks those who try to escape the flames.

The politician walks up to Satan and demands an explanation. “Yesterday it was so nice! A garden, golf, beautiful women, free food and drinks. Yet today you are torturing my friends. What the heck man?” The devil (no longer friendly and cool as he was the day before) smiles slyly. “Sorry for the mixup. But you are a politician, so surely you understand: yesterday we were campaigning, but today you voted.”

The sheriff decided that easiest solution to this would be to hold an interview/tryout for the position where they can pick the best suited candidate to be trained. They put up a huge sign advertising the position and the interview sessions for Sunday morning. 

Sunday morning comes and when the sheriff walks into the office the secretary points to him that they've got 3 people waiting in the lobby to audition for the role of investigator. 

The sheriff goes into the next room and calls the first guy in;

""Hey sheriff, I've been wanting to be a investigator since I could first walk and -""

The sheriff interrupts him and hands him a folder and tells him that his is a man wanted for robberies around town, how would you personally find and stop him. 

After opening the folder the applicant says, 
""Oh that's sheriff!, hes only got one eye, I would just have a look out for a guy one eye.""

The sheriff rips the folder from the guy and looks at it.
""You idiot, this picture in her is a profile view! Get the hell out here !""

Sheriff calls in the next guy and explains the same thing to him

In less than 2 minutes the guy hands the folder back to the sheriff.
""I'm surprised you have had trouble catching this guy sheriff, the guys only got one eyebrow! How hard can that be!?""

"".... its a profile view you dunce""

The sheriff is blown away by the stupidly of his town and tells the guy to get the hell out of his office

The sheriff calls in the third guy.
""Look the last two idiots really blew this interview - please just think carefully about this.""
The sheriff hands him the folder and he starts studying everything very carefully. 

The applicant is in there for about 20-30 minutes studying this file. 

The sheriff has fallen asleep as this guy examines everything until he states,

""I think I got it Sheriff... This man wears contacts; there are 3 shops around town were this man would have to come to get his contacts, if we can set up surveillance at those 3 shops we got our guy!""

The sheriff is surprised. He excuses himself to go check the guys medical records in the next room and comes back to room with the applicant. 

""How did you know the guy wears contacts? That wasn't even in the folder I gave you?""

The guy replies,
"" Oh its easy sheriff, hes only got 1 ear, so there is now way he can wear glasses!""",The Local Rural Police Station is in need of a new investigator,0

A couple decides to go on vacation at a Caribbean resort, in the same place they had passed their honeymoon twenty years before.

Unfortunately, due to issues on the workplace, the wife cannot go, but she tells her husband to go regardless, because she would have reached him a couple days after.

When he arrives in his room, he finds out that there is a computer with Internet access, so he decides to send a mail to his wife. However, he makes a mistake while typing the destination address. 

The e-mail is received by an old widow that was just coming back from her husband's funeral, and she decided to check her mailbox. Soon after, her son comes back home, and finds his mother fainted, head on the keybord. On the screen, this e-mail:

 ""Love of my life, at last I have arrived. You'll probably be surprised to receive mails by me from here, but as of now they have computers here too, so it is possible to write messages to loved ones.
As soon as I could, I started preparing the place for you in prevision of your coming next friday... I am looking forward to seeing you, and I hope your journey will be as pleasant as mine.

P.S.: Make sure to bring very light clothes, it is hella hot in this place!""

One morning, the father walks outside to find their cow dead.

""There is nothing that could help get us out of poverty now,"" says the dad as he shoots himself.

The mom walks outside and sees the dad and the cow on the ground.

""I can't live without my husband,"" she says as she shoots herself with her husband's gun.

The daughter walks outside and sees her mother, father and cow dead.

""I can't live any longer without my family,"" she says as she jumps into the river and kills herself.

The oldest son, 23 years old, walks outside looking for the family and sees them all dead.

""Is there anyway to bring them back,"" he yells at the sky.

Poof! A female leprechaun appears.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The boy fucks her 3 times in a row and he dies.

The middle son, 19 years old, comes out and sees the leprechaun. She gives him the same offer as his brother.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son agrees to do it but can only do it 4 times. He dies.

The youngest son, 15 years old, comes out and is given the same offer.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 10 times in a row?""

The leprechaun thinks. She says, ""I will bring back your family and give you my pot of gold.

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 20 times in a row?""

She thinks again and says, ""I will bring back your family, give you my pot of gold and give you a mansion.""

The son thinks and says, ""What if I fuck you 30 times in a row?""

She thinks and says, ""I will bring back your family and make you the richest man in Ireland.""

The son says, ""Wait, how do I know you will survive it?""

""What do you mean?"" says the leprechaun.

""The cow didn't.""
