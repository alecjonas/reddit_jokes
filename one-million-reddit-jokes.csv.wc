post,37el8b,2qh72,jokes,false,1432690654,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/37el8b/the_three_window_washers_explicit/,self.jokes,,"In a large city, far from the hustle and bustle of the commoners, stood a large mansion. It was an elaborate mansion, and it was owned by one of the wealthiest men in all of the state. Its main feature was a large glass window that reflected the world beautiful. In order to keep this window clean, however, biweekly cleanings were required, and a group of three men were hired every so often to clean it. This particular group of men consisted of a white man, a black man, and a Chinese man.

Now, there's one other thing to know about this mansion. Along with its owner, his daughter lived inside the mansion with her father. Sadly, one day, the father passed away, and the woman was left with a huge mansion to live in. She inherited everything from her father--every last cent!--but there was one catch: she needed to be married in order to receive anything at all. The woman, at the time of her father's unexpected death, was not even *dating*, let alone *married*. This was a problem--the woman wanted the money and mansion. So, one day as the three men washed the window, she walked up to them from the inside of the house, naked. She held up a piece of paper with writing on it to them, and it read as follows:

""I am the daughter of the person who owned this house. He has recently passed, and I will get it once his will is read. However, I need to be married, and that's where I need your help. I will take each of you, one at a time, to my bedroom, and we will have sex. Whoever can make me scream the most, I will marry.""

Now, the three men looked at each other. Could it be real? They couldn't believe it.

""I want to go first,"" said the white guy.

""I'll go last,"" said the Chinese man. The black simply nodded, and so the white man walked inside the house. After about 20 minutes had passed, the Chinese and black guys heard something faintly from inside the house. A minute later, the white guy comes out, grinning.

""Good luck,"" he says, patting his black coworker on the back as he walks in. At this moment, the Chinese guy walks away from the other two, and from what can be seen, he looks like he is masturbating. The white guy notices this, but says nothing. After ten minutes, a noise much more audible than what had previously been heard came from within. The white guy hung his head, knowing he would not marry the gorgeous woman. The black guy came out, and the Chinese man went in without a word. The black man is confident--surely that small-dicked *Chinese* guy couldn't do better than him! However, not even one minute passes before the white and black guys can hear the loudest screams they'd ever heard from anyone. The two look at each other in surprise, unsure of what the hell just happened. They run in, thinking that perhaps their coworker had done something violent. As they reach the woman's door, the Chinese guy steps out, with a smile stretching from ear to ear. 

""What the hell did you do?"" asks the white guy. The Chinese guy simply continues to grin, but after a moment, decides to answer in a sing-song voice:

""Me Chinese, me so slick, me put Windex on my dick!""

(Sorry, Chinese people, if this is offensive. I know that's a terrible stereotype, but that's how the joke goes.)",The Three Window Washers [explicit],1

- That's nothing, he survived that too. He crawled from under it, went out the bedroom, tried to lean against the handrails next to the stairwell, but he toppled over, hitting the chandelier on his way down. And when he fell to the ground level, the chandelier fell on him.

-- I don't know what to say...that's a terrible end!

- You think so? He survived that, and he crawled into the kitchen, he tried to get a grip, but grabbed the kettle, lost his balance, ripping the wires out of the wall, but and the hot water it contained splashed on his face.

-- That...that must have been the last straw...

- You would think so? He tried to reach for the phone to call the ambulance, but he stepped on the wire he ripped out of the wall just a moment ago, and because he was still wet, he got electrocuted, also shorting out everything...

 a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts. 
 So the next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great 
 job. He can sleep all he wants, play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, 
 eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on tires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more 
 attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage, 
 crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves 
 it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. Well, this goes on 
 for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day 
 when he is dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. 
 The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the 
 lion close behind. Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, ""Help, Help me!"", but the lion is quick and pounces. The 
 mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, ""Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get

The other kids noticed, too, and they started to make fun of me!!""

The mother discusses the problem with his father, and all they can think of to do is take the kid to see a doctor.

Have him eat burnt toast every day, and I guarantee you he will become much more well-endowed after a short period of time.""

The parents bring the child home, somewhat bewildered by the strange advice.  The next morning, the kid wakes up and comes downstairs to the kitchen table, and there sits a huge stack of burnt toast about three feet high!  The kid says, ""Mom, I appreciate that you want to help, but there's no way I can eat all that!""  The mother replies, ""You're only getting one slice--the rest is for your father.""",Burnt Toast,14

He was a very energetic child, although he didn't get much to eat or play with. He was still optimistic and happy always, though. His parents both loved him and his seven siblings equally.

The boy loved his father the most, though. His dad was always there for him and would always take him out to the woods to play with a ball. They both had fun all the time!

One day, however, everything changed. Ivan's beloved father was fired from his job since he was no longer needed, so the family was out of money. Desperate to make money, he stole some bread from a shop owner. 

Ivan's father was sentenced to be thrown into a gulag for the rest of his life, where he did backbreaking labor until his back gave in. At that point, he was lined up against a wall along with all the other useless prisoners and shot by guards. 

Ivan was devestated. He couldn't believe his beloved father was gone, and when his mother got the news that her beloved husband was dead, she killed herself out of grief, leaving the seven children orphaned. 

The kids went into the woods instead of into civilization, hoping to be able to live off of the land, but they only lasted one month in the unforgiving Russian winter.

Ivan was the only survivor. The others had died, but he was the strongest and most determined of them, and be basically refused to give up and die like they did. Eventually, he found a bear hunter who took him to civilization. He was saved.

Twenty years later, Ivan is now an adult. The economy in Russia (the USSR is now gone) is bad, so he doesn't have a job. One day, he reads about the success of the United States of America in a newspaper, so he decides to go there.

He packs his bags, gets on a ferry with money he had gotten from his long-lost grandfather's will, and goes to America.

When he gets there, he finds a nice apartment to stay in and begins looking for job oppurtunities. When he doesn't find anything good, he sighs and goes to take a walk, hoping to get some ideas. 

While walking, he passes a swimming pool that has a sign labelled 'HELP WANTED'. Ivan smiles, for he has always had a passion for swimming, so he goes there and signs up to be a swimming instructor.

However, he is told that he needs to prove that he can swim well enough, so he is instructed to do a few laps in the pool.

He smiles and takes off his clothes, revealing his large muscles. The secretary, who is female, is quite aroused. He then flawlessly dives into the water and completes all the laps in a minute. He gets the job.

Three weeks into his new job, he is told by a student at the pool that he could be a pro swimmer at the Olympics with his talent. He decided to do just that, so he begins training more before signing up for the Olympics.

Time comes for the Olympics, and he dives into the water and swims for all his worth. However, he only makes third place because the other swimmers are also very experienced and talented, possibly even more. 

The press asks him how he feels and he says, ""It's alright. I've dealt with many hardships in my life.""

Four years later, he signs up for the Olympics again, and this time, he gets fourth place, which is even worse.

The press asks about how he feels, and he says, ""It's alright. I've dealt with many hardships in my life"".

Four years later, he signs up again, and this time, he finally gets the gold medal!

He is hailed as a hero in his homeland, Russia. Everyone there is talking about him and how he has brought pride to his nation. There is even a petition asking for Ivan to come to Russia to bask in the glory, and it has two hundred thousand signatures so far. Eventually, Ivan agrees and heads for Russia.

Before he goes, he packs his bags, as usual. He gets on a boat, which he notices is very sturdy. 

Halfway through the journey, two Russian passengers recognize him and ask for autographs. He happily obliges.

They then ask if he can demonstrate his skills by swimming in the ocean, which he agrees to.

The helmsman, who is also a big fan, excitedly stops the boat in order for Ivan to demonstrate his swimming prowess to the excited passengers. The entire boat is anticipating this.

Ivan gets to the top of the boat, waves to everyone, and then dives. However, instead of landing in the water, he accidentally crashes headfirst onto the sturdy floor of the boat.

There is blood everywhere, and Ivan seems to have numerous broken bones and countless scratches and scrapes. However, to everyone's surprise, he gets up without any trouble. 

The horrified passengers ask him if he's okay, and he says:

""It's alright. I've dealt with many hard ships in my life.""",The Tale of Ivan Bolshekev,235

Shortly after Terry's 18th birthday (where he of course had a tractor birthday cake and received numerous tractor themed gifts)  Terry's life turned on it's head. An old farmer, a tractor driver and hero of Terry's stopped him in the street and said ""Isn't it about time you grew up a bit lad and stopped wasting your life obsessing over tractors?"" Terry had developed a thick skin over the years when it came to ignoring the haters but he knew that this man was no hater, he was a tractor lover and had Terry's best interests at heart. 

After a couple of days of deep thought and soul searching Terry made his decision. The posters were ripped down, the bed spread put on ebay, the toys sent to a local charity shop. It was done. He was now a man.

Somewhat perplexed by his sudden lack of tractor entertainment options Terry decided to visit a pub for the first time. He wandered in, ordered a pint and took up residence in the corner of the pub.

Shortly after arriving Terry noticed a bit of commotion over by the bar *note this was in the days before the smoking ban*. A towel left too close to the ashtray had caught fire on a cigarette ember. Smoke rapidly began to fill the room and despite the bar staff successfully extinguishing the fire and wafting vigorously they were soon left with no option but to order everyone out of the bar.

Just as people began to leave Terry stood up. ""wait"" he shouted, everyone watched as he ran over to where the smoke was the thickest and took in a huge breath inhaling all the smoke! He then ran to the window, opened it and blew all the smoke outside before returning to his original seat.

""Incredible"", ""unbelievable"", ""how on earth did you do that!?"" came the cries.

He talks to an old friend about his worries and the friend tells him ""Don't worry! Spanish is not so hard to speak. Many words are similar to english, so if you just speak slowly enough, I'm sure they will understand.""

Assured, the man goes on holiday and arrives at his hotel. He goes up to the reception desk and the clerk greets him: ""Hola, senor.""

The man decides to try his Spanish speaking skills and very, very slowly says ""Hell-o. I. Would. Like. To. Have. A. Room. Please.""

The clerk realizes the man is speaking English, but very slowly, and assumes that maybe this man is a bit slow in the head, so not wanting to embarrass him the clerk answers back, just as slowly: ""Of-course. Would. You. Like. Sea. View. Or. Gar-den. View?""

""*Oh, this works great!*"" thinks the man to himself and responds: ""Sea. View. Please.""

""Smo-ker. Or. Non. Smo-ker?"" the clerks inquires.

""Non. Smo-ker."" answers the man, happy with how well speaking Spanish is going.

The clerk asks ""Are. You. A-me-ri-can?""

The man answers ""Yes. I. Am.""

The clerk tells him ""Won-der-ful! I. Stud-ied. Ho-tel. Ma-nage-ment. In. Ca-li-for-ni-a. And. Learned. To. Speak. Eng-lish. There.""

Realising the clerk knows English, the man then leans forward and asks: ""Then. Why. Are. We. Spea-king. Spa-nish. To. Each. O-ther?""","A man was going for a holiday to Acapulco, Mexico...",8

She went over to the machine, stepped up on the scale and put her nickel in. Out came a card that read, ""You are a nun. You weigh 128 lbs, and you are going to Chicago.""

The Nun sat back down and told herself that the machine probably gives the same card to everyone. The more she thught about it, the more curious she got so she decided to try it again. She went back to the machine and again put her nickel in. Out came a card that read: ""You are a Nun. You weigh 128 lbs. You are going to Chicago and you are going to play a fiddle.""

The Nun says to herself, ""I know that is wrong. I have never played a musical instrument even once in my life."" She sat back down.

From out of nowhere a cowboy came over and sat down, putting his fiddle case on the seat between them. Without thinking, she opened the cowboy's case, took out the fiddle, and started playing beautiful music.

Surprised at what she had done, she looked over at the machine, thinking ""this is incredible. I've got to try this again.""

Back to the machine she went, put in another nickel, and another card came out. It read, ""You are a Nun. You weigh 128 lbs. You are going to Chicago and you are going to break wind."" Now she knows the machine is wrong as she thought to herself ""I've never broken wind in public a single time in my life."" But getting down off the machine she slipped, and as she was straining to keep herself from falling to the floor, she broke wind.

Absolutely stunned, she sat back down and looked at the machine. She said to herself, ""This is truly remarkable. I've got to try this again."" 

She went back to the machine, put in another nickel, and another card came out. It read, ""You are a Nun. You weigh 128 lbs. You have fiddled and farted around and missed your flight to Chicago.""","A nun was sitting at the airport, waiting for her flight to Chicago.",23

Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was.

Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.

The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth.

This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.

Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.

By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said, ""Big John doesn't pay!"" the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, ""And why not??""

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”


And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”

All their knowledge was in vain as they could do nothing about it.
 A relative of his who saw this, told him about a hermit who lived on the peak of the Himalayas who had been known to cure anything.

 Encouraged by this he took a trip to the Himalayas . After reaching the village at the foothills of the mountains, he climbed his way to the peak.... At the top of the peak he noticed a 10ft high brick wall surrounding it. Perplexed he walked all around the wall to find a portion where a few bricks had been pulled out to form footholds and a rope hanging over the wall. The man scaled the wall using the rope and jumped over to see an amazing sight.

A small hut with a tiny pond . He entered the hut and there he saw the hermit. The hermit was in deep meditation and was irked by his disturbance. The man lay prostrate and narrated his problem with folded hands. The hermit took pity on him and told him "" My son, dip your dick twice in the magical pond and you shall receive what you need"". The man hurridly rushed out to do as the hermit said and Lo! he now had 13 inch long weiner! Excited he scaled down the mountains and spent his night at the village brothel.

 After exhausting all the women in brothel he proceeded the next day to visit the hermit and thank him. He climbed the mountains, used the rope to scale the wall and entered the hermit's home. Overjoyed with gratitude the man thanked the hermit profusely . The man while leaving asked the Hermit that if his penis was 13 inches long how long was the Hermit's ? 

The hermit replied "" Check that rope again"".

...and they're greeted by St. Peter.

""Well, hello there!"", He says cheerfully. ""Welcome to Heaven! Please, follow me and I'll escort you to where you'll be staying!""

First, He shows the priest his new home. It's a shabby apartment, and there are hundreds of identical apartments surrounding it.

""This is where you'll be staying!"", He says to the priest, who is shocked at how shitty heaven is compared to how he thought it would be.

Nonetheless, he sighs and enters his apartment, which is even shittier inside.

""And as for you..."", St. Peter says to the politician. ""BEHOLD! Your very own mansion, twice as big as the White House! It's got fifteen bedrooms, twelve bowling alleys, sixteen indoor pools, two indoor zoos, and much, much more!""

The politician spends approximately fourteen minutes cheering, dancing, and thanking St. Peter before entering his new place. 

From his window, the priest sees this. He storms out of his apartment and shoves St. Peter before saying, ""What the fuck, man?! I devoted my entire fucking life to your gay religion and I get a gayass apartment while that lousy motherfucker gets a fucking MANSION? Explain now!"".

St. Peter merely chuckles and says, ""You know how many fuckin' priests come here? Thousands! Meanwhile, that guy's the first politician that ever made it here!""

post,3753ry,2qh72,jokes,false,1432509768,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3753ry/the_noise/,self.jokes,,"A travelling salesman is driving along a dusty backroad to his next sale, when his car starts belching smoke. He sees storm clouds coming his way and night is falling soon. Getting out of the car he looks around for shelter and sees an antiquated old monastery on a hill not 5 minutes walk away. He heads over and knocks on the door just as the rain starts falling and a kindly monk answers.
""Hi, my car is broken down on the road"" says the salesman, ""and I see a storm coming in. Can I stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning? I won't be any trouble...""
""not at all my good man"" the kindly monk replied, ""Come in! Come in! Lets get you a hot meal and some dry clothes!""

So the salesman is ushered into the church and given a wonderful bowl of hearty stew and bread to eat. Not realizing his hunger before the salesman devours the food in between words of thanks.
""I don't know how I can repay you people...""
""well actually"" said the kindly monk who answered the door, ""our abbot bores so easily in the realitive solitude of our church, and he loves to talk with travelers""
""of course!"" replied the salesman, ""in return for this hospitality its the least i could do""

So the kindly monk leads the salesman deeper into the monastery and as he does he hears the faintest sound...
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...
But the salesman thinks its just the storm outside making noise and pays it no mind. He reaches the abbots quarters and meets a man seemingly as ancient as the building he runs who greets him with a smile and firm handshake.
The two speak to each other at length with hours seeming like minutes as the storm pounds the outside, and all the while the man hears that same noise...
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

Eventually the conversation draws to a natural end and the abbot looks over the salesman's shoulder.
""good heavens, look at the time. we both should get some rest"" the abbot commented, ""the brother you met before will take you to your chambers for the night""

And so the salesman is taken to his spartan looking accommodations, and just as the kindly monk is leaving the room the salesman asks,
""by the way, i keep hearing this strange thumping sound all the time. Its that normal? What is that?""
The monk looks down at his feet, and for the first time since the salesman came into the monastery the smile falls from his face. He quickly stares at the floor and stammers,
""I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. Sleep well."" Slamming the door behind him.

The salesmans sleep is restless as now the same sound as before stays next to him, breathing on his neck....
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...
When dawn breaks the salesman calls a tow truck, and while waiting says his goodbyes and thank yous. Finally when the tow truck arrives he turns to the abbot and says,
""thank you so much for everything again, but I must ask; what is that strange thudding noise I hear? The storm is over yet I heard it clearly all night?""
The monk gains a sudden steel in his eyes and locks them dead onto the salesman.
""I can't tell you, you're not a monk.""
And with that, bids him farewell.

The salesman finishes his route without incident, and heads home to his wife and child. But incessantly, as if by hearing it he could no longer un-hear it, at the quietest moments in his life, the salesman hears a soft
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

The seasons pass into years and the years pass into decades. The mans son grows and leaves to be his own man, and after decades of bliss the mans wife passes away peacefully in his arms one morning. As the life leaves his loves eyes the only sound heard is a simple
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

With a life now emptier the thudding becomes constant, unceasing, droning. When he sleeps, eats, shits
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

Finally, standing it no longer the man drives all day and night to the same dirt road he so happened to break down upon and every mile, every town he passes as constant as the odometer
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

Finally he reaches the monastery and knocks on the door and just as before a fresh faced kinly monk answers.
""I WISH TO JOIN YOUR ORDER"" the man blurts before the monk can say anything. The monk gains a knowing smile and says no more, beckoning the man to follow him.

He leads the man on the same path he took those years and years before and directs him into the abbots room. Inside is the same man as the night he stayed before, looking not a day older.
""Please abbot."" The man begged, ""I can't stop hearing that thudding noise, night and day I can't escape it. Can't you let me know what it is?""
The abbot replies with the same steely matter-of-fact tone as he did all those years before,
""I can't tell you, you're not a monk.""
""Thats what I feared your answer would be. Please then, let me become a monk so I can learn and get this sound from my head.""
The abbot takes a long look, dripping with both hunger and pity and after a handful of breathes agrees.""

The training is arduous and lengthy. The salesman is not a young man anymore and the demands, moth mental and physical task him to the core of his very being. He sleeps on stone, reads nothing but the texts of the obscure religious sect he wishes to join and eats nothing but gruel and through every minute, every blister, every headache, every pang of hunger the sound is there.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

Finally after several years worth of trails the man finally is ready to be inducted. The moment after the ceremony inducting him is complete he bolts to the chambers of the abbot.
""There, I did it. I'm a member of the order. NOW TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS.""
""Are you sure you wish to know?"" the abbot grimaces, ""It will change the way you think of not just the order, or me, but everything.""
""Yes!"" the man cries ""I've never been more sure of anything in my life!""
""Very well"" replied the abbot. And with that the sound in the mans head lessened, as if the promise curiosity being fed was able to sate the beast, even if for a moment. But still, even though quieter it was still present.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

The abbot pulls a seemingly random book off the shelf behind him, and opens it. He reveals it to be hollow and pulls a monstrous set of keys from it and tucks them into his sleeve. He then pulls another book from the shelf and the shelf splits in half and opens like the doors in a supermarket with the sound of the grinding of ancient stone. Where the shelves used to be there is a door made of iron. The abbot pulls the set of keys out with an iron key extended, opens the door and swings it aside. As the man follows the abbot into the path behind the door he notices the sound getting louder.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

They walk along a dark and musty path, the air like a forgotten wine cellar or crypt with the abbot wordlessly staring forward with grim purpose. He reaches the next door, a door made of polished bronze, reflecting as perfectly as a mirror. He pulls out a bronze key from the keyring in his sleeve and opens the door. Sure enough as the man passes though, a little louder this time
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

After the bronze door came a staircase, down and down and down it went, until it seemed that they were descending into hell itself. Winding stairs, spiral stairs, branching stairs leading to nowhere and yet the two marched on, reaching a silver door. The abbot pulled out a silver key and as before set the door aside, making the sound ever louder.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

And then, it was time to climb. Yet the abbot, a man of innumerable years climbed as surefooted as a goat while the salesman followed behind, exhausted but determined not to give up now. At the apex of the climb, a door of gold was before them. The abbot then pulled a gold key, and in the grim routine as before, the door fell aside and the sound became ever louder. It seemed to be right next to them, a tangible force. A third person on this bizarre trek.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

After the golden door came a maze. Dizzying and seemingly endless, the abbot had no hesitation in his step and never second guessed himself. Hours passed in the maze as hours had passed in all the paths before and yet without ever turning around the abbot and the salesman reached a platinum door. As you can guess, platinum key, door, noise.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...
As the man walked into the next door he hesitated for the first time on his trip. The walls themselves seemed to be alive, screaming things in alien tongues as if the brick and mortar where being tortured. Grotesque faces in the masonry screamed as if every injustice upon earth was being visited upon them and yet somehow they could not drown out that sound, pounding louder than it ever had.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

After the hours that seemed of days in the pathway that screamed ceaselessly they reached a door, red and pulsing, as if made of some sort of flesh. The abbot pulled out a bony, fleshy....something from his keyring and inserted it into the door. All at once the walls stopped screaming, the flesh melted into nothing on the floor and the sound grew terrible and great. Louder and unchanged.
thump thump...thump thump...thump thump...

Behind the former wall of flesh was not another passage but a box. Wooden small and humble. The abbot pulled out one final key of wood and unlocked and opened the box. As he pulled the box open the sound became deafeningly loud and the man finally looked inside and gave a horrified scream.
And I'd love to tell you what was inside, but you're not a monk.",The noise,33

When I got home, my boyfriend seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, “Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.” He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table.

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call.

The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my boyfriend was out the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I let three more go. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable!

Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my boyfriend returned as he apologized for taking so long. He asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and 12 dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, “Happy Birthday.”

When I read this, I just had to share.

Me: ""I've never seen a boner through pants before""
BF: ""Why's that?""
Me: ""Because everytime I see one, the pants immediately come off.""

In short, what I said had come out completely different to what I had intended, but much to both of our humorous delights. Immediately, he started making statements similar to the silliness I had just said, and after composing myself from being doubled over in laughter, I later joined in. The following are some of the jokes we came up with, and now we're trying to figure out the formula (note: these are to be read in a dry humor/Stephen Wright style)

I've never had to do laundry

Why's that?

Because every time I have dirty clothes, I just wash them

-------------------------------
I've never run out of gas before

Why's that?

Because every time I run out of gas, I just fill'er up

--------------------------------
I've never had to get the mail

Why's that?

Because every time I have mail, the postman delivers it

---------------------------------
I've never had cake this good before

Why's that?

Because every time I do, I eat it

---------------------------------
I've never had to cool off before

Why's that?

Because every time I'm hot, I just turn on the fan

Can you figure it out? We've already concluded that one of the components seems to be mockery of the listener's stupidity in expecting a contradictory response. Sometimes there's double-meaning, but overall, it seems to work best with the speaker talking about having never taken some sort of action, especially in tasks that are considered run of the mill. All other nuances for how the joke works is lost on us at the moment. Help us figure it out, redditors. :)",New dry humor joke format! Help us figure out the formula!,0

The diner is even more impressed.  

After the meal, while leaving a tip, he sees the waiter walk past.  Discreetly, he grabs the waiter and murmurs, ""Sorry, son, but do you know that you have a string hanging from your fly?""

The waiter replies, ""Yes, we all do. Another efficiency measure.  We used to each spend a minute or more washing our hands after using the men's room. So, the owner gave us all strings to tie to the end of our penises. When we need to go, we simply pull the string to get it out and then return to work.  See, if we don't touch ourselves, we don't need to wash our hands, and we can spend less time in the men's room and more time waiting on the customers.""

The blonde recognizing that the scientist was much smarter balked at the deal and so the scientist, being confident, upped the stakes: ""If you ask me a question I can't answer, I'll give you $20.""

The blonde agreed and the scientist started with the first question.
""What is chemical composition of water?"" The blond gave the scientist $5. On the blonde's turn she asked ""What has three legs going up a hill and four legs going down?"" The scientist thought and thought and thought but was completely stumped. Even sneaking a peak and googling didn't turn up an answer. Finally the scientist has to admit defeat and hands over $20.

To his surprise, a flatbed truck crawls by, and the back is filled to the brim with penguins. Unsurprisingly, he wanders what the heck is going on, and immediately pulls out, tailing the truck.

He signals for the driver to pull over, and the truck pulls over onto the hard shoulder. The cop gets out and approaches the truck, keeping an eye on all of the penguins. Needless to say, he is mightily confused.

The policeman gets to the front of the truck and peers into the cab, to see a fairly innocuous middle-aged man at the wheel. The driver winds down the window and the cop asks ""What on earth are you doing with all these penguins?""

The driver shrugs, not seeming too bothered.

The flustered officer pauses for a moment, and states ""Alright, you need to take all these creatures to the zoo, right? Get 'em off the road, and take them to the zoo. That should sort things out.""

The driver seems to enthusiastically approve, and smiles back, as if he thought that were a great idea. The officer, more than a little taken aback by the situation, notes down the truck's registration number and then gets back into his police car and drives off.

Time passes.

The next day, the road cop is back in the lay-by, watching the traffic, wandering what happened to the truckload of penguins. Suddenly, the very same truck appears again, travelling in the opposite direction. Once again, the penguins are all in the back, though this time - and he has to blink to check he's seeing it right - they've all got sunglasses on.

Confused (and a little bit concerned for his mental health), the officer pulls out and tails the truck. He signals for it to pull over and jumps out the car, preparing to give some stern words. He passes the penguins in sunglasses, gets to the cab at the front and, finding the same driver, confronts him. ""What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you think this badge is just a joke? These penguins should *not* be on the road, and furthermore, you completely ignored what I said yesterday, which was to-""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound; a sound like no other that he has ever heard. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you because you're not a monk. 


The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.


The monks again accept him, feed him, and even fix his car..


That night, he hears the same strange mesmerizing sound that he had heard years earlier.


The next morning, he asks what the sound was, but the monks reply,

We can't tell you because you're not a monk.


The man says, all right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?


The monks reply, you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.


The man sets about his task. Some forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have travelled the earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.


The monks reply, ""Congratulations, you are correct, and you are now considered a monk.
We shall now show you the way to the sound.""


The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, the sound is behind that door.



The man reach for the knob, but the door is locked. He asks ""May I have the key?"" 



The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.


Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone... The man requests the key to the stone door.



The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. And so it went on until the man had gone through doors of emerald,...



...silver, topaz, and amethyst.



Finally, the monks say, This is the key to the last door.




The man is relieved to be at the end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is astonished to find the source of that strange sound. It is truly an amazing and unbelievable sight. 

   



.. But I can't tell you what it is, because you're not a monk.

After a month on the island his natural yearnings are beginning to get the better of him, as they do, the more appealing the pig becomes. Putting thoughts of bestiality to the back of his mind, he carries on being marooned.


Another month passes and his raging loins are too much, he throws aside his trousers, grabs this pig by the back trotters and is moments from inserting his penis into the pigs anus when the dog begins going berserk, and trying to bite the bloke. Eventually he shoves the pig to the floor and sods off for a wank.


This happens three more times over the following weeks. Depressed, hungry and randy, the bloke begins to accept his fate when suddenly a raft appears just off the shore. He swims out to it, and upon bringing it to the sandy shore he notices a beautiful, young blond woman. He gives her mouth to mouth until she finally comes round. Looking in his eyes, she says, 
""You have saved my life, I'm indebted to you forever. I will do whatever you want me to""


""Wow! Anything?""


""Anything,"" she says, winking.

generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the U.S. Department of Energy.

I then took a shower in the clean water provided by a municipal water
utility.

After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC-regulated channels to see
what the National Weather Service of the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration determined the weather was going to be like,
using satellites designed, built, and launched by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

I watched this while eating my breakfast of U.S. Department of
Agriculture-inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

At the appropriate time, as regulated by the U.S. Congress and kept
accurate by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the
U.S. Naval Observatory, I get into my National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration-approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built
by the local, state, and federal Departments of Transportation, possibly
stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the
Environmental Protection Agency, using legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve Bank.

On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the
U.S. Postal Service and drop the kids off at the public school.

After spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to
the workplace regulations imposed by the Department of Labor and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, enjoying another two meals which again do not kill me because of the USDA, I drive my NHTSA car back home on the DOT roads, to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and Fire Marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables, thanks to the local police department.

And then I log on to the internet -- which was developed by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Administration -- and post on Freerepublic.com and Fox News forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right.",Saw someone post this on Facebook. Got a kick out of it.,8
