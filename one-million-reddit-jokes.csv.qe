A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. Recognizing a promotional opportunity, the NASA folks found a tape recorder. 

After the old man recorded his message, they asked his son to translate it. He refused. The NASA PR people brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the elder's message.

post,5leseo,2qh72,jokes,false,1483269644,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5leseo/god_didnt_damn_it_the_beavers_did/,self.jokes,,"Satan is a beaver. What is my proof of this? Well, it's simple.
Adam and Eve were walking around the garden near the river when Eve says to Adam ""Hey, Adam, what if we ate the forbidden fruit? Maybe we'll trip balls""
So Adam says back, quite frustrated ""God damn it"", and he walks away leaving Eve all by herself.
God heard Adam's plea, so he created the beaver, and told him ""Go dam the river for me. Adam told me to do it, and I never question what a man wants!""
So the beaver set to work building the dam for Adam. He toiled day and night, using up more and more trees. Eventually, the beaver runs out of good trees to use, so he asks God ""Hey, can I use the tree of knowledge of good and evil? I mean, it's not like anyone is using it""
Naturally, God gave permission to the beaver to cut the forsaken tree down to use as the last piece to the dam.
But, the beaver did not use the whole tree because one of the fruits fell to the ground while the beaver was cutting away at its trunk. The fruit rolled down the hill, and stopped at Eve's feet.
Since Adam wasn't around because he was still upset with Eve's preposterous idea, Eve took the unstared temptation to heart, and stomach, and ate the forbidden fruit.
When she was done eating, she looked around and noticed that all the trees were gone, and the river that ran through the garden had run dry. She ran to find Adam, and picked up leaves along the way. When she reached Adam, she said ""quick, Adam, the garden has disappeared, and we are no longer clothed by the trees! Cover your skin with these leaves or else the garden will be lost forever!""
Adam obliged, because of course he couldn't deny that she was right.
They quickly covered themselves with leaves, and ran to an outcropping of boulders in order to hide themselves further.
God came along, and said ""where are you, Adam? I did what you said. I dammed it""
Adam said ""I'm right here"".
When God looked upon him, and saw that he was clothed in leaves, he said ""Why are you covering yourself?""
""Because, God, the garden disappeared, and we no longer feel safe because there is a whole world out there, and now it can see us""
So God said to Adam ""This is what you asked for. If you don't like it, you can leave. Go work in the fields for all I care. Plant your own garden, and dam it yourself!""
And that's just what they did.
Years passed, and humanity grew in size, and eventually formed kingdoms, which turned into nations, and those nations, following God's advice, built dams all over the place.
One day, one of the descendants of Adam says ""we have dammed every river, we have dammed every stream. We have done everything that God told us to do, and now the whole dam nation is damned!""","God didn't damn it, the beavers did.",0

Dave said, 'I'll be fast. I'll throw the money on the floor, you bend down, and I'll be finished by the time you pick it up. '
She thought for a moment and said that she would have to consult her boyfriend. So she called her boyfriend and told him the story.
Her boyfriend says, 'Ask him for $200, pick up the money very fast, he won't even be able to get his Pants down.'
So she agrees and accepts the proposal. Half an hour goes by, and the boyfriend is waiting for his girlfriend to call.
Finally, after 45 minutes, the boyfriend calls and asks what happened.
She responded, 'The bastard used coins!'

The doctor thinks for a moment and says, ""We have three options. The first involves pills that will increase your size. The second is physical therapy to stretch you longer. The third is replacement surgery.""

The man looks surprised. ""Replacement? With what?""

""A baby elephant trunk.""

The man looks puzzled for a moment, ""Doctor, I have a date with her in a week. Which method will get me ready by then?""

""Well, the pills take a month, so they're out. The physical therapy takes two weeks so it's no good. But after the surgery, you'll be sore, but everything will be fine.""

""Well, okay. If you think the elephant trunk is the way to go, I'll do it!""

A week later the man is sitting across the table from a beautiful woman who he is completely enamored with.

""Should we start with some rolls?"" He asks her.

""That sound's perfect"" she says, ""I'm so hungry.""

He signals the waiter over and puts one of the rolls on his plate. 

In a flash his baby elephant trunk penis whips out of his pants, grabs the roll and disappears.

The woman is shocked. ""What the hell was that?!""

""That was my baby elephant trunk penis."" The man says, squirming a bit.

""That was amazing"" The woman is trying to see over the table to his crotch. ""Can I see it again?""

Each time he arrived a village, it would disappear from the map. But the monster was reasonable. As soon as he came to the village, the head of the village would be summoned, deciding the fate of themselves.

The monster said: ""I will just ask one question. If you can answer it, I will never come back to this village again. If the answer is wrong, three people should die each day. For the first time answering, three days for you, but there must be treats for me for the time being."". He asked: ""What does a woman want to have most?"". No village survived.

But there was a young man, head of this wealthy village, who settled the village and made it successful. Such a beautiful village was soon on sight of the monster. One day, he came to the village, stomped his axe to the ground, shouted: ""THE UNDERLORD IS HERE."".

People crumbled. The legend of his power was known. Everyone looked at the only hope: village head. They confronted the monster, knowing what the monster would say. The village panicked. 3 days was about to end soon but still there was no final answer. Someone would die... They asked many woman in and out the village, there were too many good answer, and known to be wrong since destroyed villages left their notes. Some said penises. Some said wealthy. Some said children. A good man, happiness, fame... were not the answer the village looking for. But there was a woman they didn't ask. She was hated, disgusted by the looks. She was there at the first day of the village, but was thrown out of the village just because she was too ugly and looked like a witch. It was the village's vote, the head couldn't do anything. Anyhow, she later became a witch after learning secrets from the forest, then lived there forever.

They all came to the witch's house, telling her the situation. She laughed uncontrollably. She KNEW the answer. Resisting the urge to laugh, she said: ""I know the answer, but I have conditions. I want the village head to marry me, love and live with me forever."". People was given the hope. They pushed the village head to do so. He paused for a while but then had no other choice. ""The day the monster goes away is the day of our marriage."", the witch said.

Next day, they came to the monster, telling him: ""What woman wants most is the right to decide everything on her own"". Of course it was the right answer. The monster was both surprised and angry and the same time. He didn't expect the village to answer it right. He then left angrily and kept his words. Next thing was the wedding. People danced, sang for their lives in happiness.

The village head didn't complain any, though he was a bit sad since he couldn't even decide his marriage. The ugly witch was moved by his behavior and his faithfulness, turned into a beautiful girl. The witch looked so fabulous that girls might turn lesbian. She said: ""This is my other appearance. I might change my appearance only twice in my life, either an ugly one or this one. What do you want honey?"". The village head, her husband, paused for few seconds then answered straightly: ""It is for you to decide"". She then smiled and remained to have beautiful look for the rest of her life, living happily with him.

The lesson of this story is that, no matter the appearance of women, THEY ARE FUCKIN WITCHES DONT FUKIN TRUST THEM.

The barkeep would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money.  

Many people had tried over time (weight lifters, longshoremen, etc.), but nobody could  do it  Then one day, this scrawny little man came in, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, ""I'd like to try the bet.""

After the laughter had died down, the barkeep said ""OK,"" grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man.

But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass.

As the crowd cheered, the host paid the $1000, and asked the little man, ""What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weightlifter, or what?""

The man replied, ""I work for the IRS.""

buy a motorcycle in college. She asks him why he wants to ride and he replies ""Because it's cool,
I'm an adult now, I want to feel free for once in my life"" 

His mum took that to heart. So off the boy goes with his dad to find a bike. They search the local
dealerships and finally find a nice Kawasaki KLR650, and the boy rides home infront of his dad 
with pride. 

When they arrive at their house, they see a woman straddling a Harley in full leathers, hair windswept
like an 80's metal guitarist, blasting Alice In Chains from the boombox on the ground beside her and 
puffing on a cigarette. 

The boy gets off his bike, takes off his helmet and walks up 

""Mom, what the fuck do you think you're doing?"" to which his mum replies

""I'm an adult now, I want to feel free for once in my life,  besides - it's cool""

The boy shakes his head and walks inside. Hoping that he'd learned his lesson, his mom returns the 
Harley and leathers, puts her hair down and goes to explain to him that image doesn't mean everything.

A few years later, the boy dropped out of college and stopped talking to his family. His mom got worried
and found out he'd joined a biker gang. Mortified, she went immediately to their club to confront her son. 
She goes up to the door and it's opened by a huge bearded monster, covered in tattoos and scars. She takes 
a drag on her cigarette, pushes her crazy hair behind her shoulder and says ""I'm here to join your club""
The giant biker can she's got no tattoos, makeup done, she's just playing dress up but decides to humor her
""Okay then, but you've got to meet the requirements - first: do you have a bike?""

Mom gestures with her cigarette towards the Harley, the biker nods and says ""second, how much do you smoke?""

Mom pulls two empty packet out of her pockets before she finds the full one, lights up three more and takes
a drag on all at once, blowing the smoke at the giant biker

The biker nods and says ""third, have you ever been picked up by the fuzz?""

Mom is silent, thinking for a second and finally replies ""Yes, and I've been swung around by my nipples too""",A boy is buying his first motorcycle,9

âNo one has worked more tirelessly for the glory of the Fatherland than Donald Trump,â the Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an official statement. âHe has set a high bar for all Kremlin employees, and for that, we salute him.â


To mark the honor, Trumpâs name will be added to a plaque that hangs in the hallway outside the Kremlinâs H.R. office.

According to Kremlin sources, Trump faced tough competition in the Employee of the Month voting, besting both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ExxonMobilâs C.E.O., Rex Tillerson.

Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate, in Florida, Trump called the award âa tremendous honor, just tremendous.â

âObama was President for eight years and he didnât win this a single month,â he said. âLoser.â",Trump was named employee of the month by the Kremlin,2

There was a guy in a small village called 'Amda' and he had a weird fetish of trying to stick his dick in anyone who bends over infront of him. 

People in his village started to avoid him once they got to know this fetish of his and that made Amda desperate to stick his dick in someone.

One day he was walking down the street and he saw a cow, which was eating grass in a field facing away from Amda. Being uncontrollably horny, he tried to stick it in the cow. The cow freaked out, kicked him and he died.

The next day his body was being prepaired by the funeral home, and the Embalmer had to cut off his man parts because he had a hard-on when he died and it would show up when he was dressed. So he cut his genetals off and dressed the body up ,placed him in the coffin and closed the lid. 

When he was just about to close up and leave, the Embalmers wife walked in and saw the cut off genitals lying in the table and went.

""Oh, i didn't know that Amda passed away! when is his funaral?""



Part 2



Although Amda was a sex addict, he was a religous person and he went to heaven. As he was standing outside the pearly gates, disappointed that he couldn't satisfy his fetish before he died, was approached by St.Peters.

""Amda, you are a good person and you can enter heaven because of that. But you have to leave any wierd fetishes outside of pearly gates before you enter because that kind of behaviour is not allowed in here, Do you agree?""

After some thought, Amda agreed.

Delighted, St.Peters took out the golden key for the Pearly Gates, turned around, and bent down to reach the keyhole of the gate.............



Part 3



The devil was called by St. Peters

""Take this wierd fuck away from me, torture him in the worst possible way you can imagine!""

The devil agreed, and took Amda away in chains.

3 months passed by and St. Peter wandered what happened to the guy who tried to fuck him in the ass. So he went down to hell and met the devil.

""Do you remember the wierdo i sent here to be tortured about 3 months back? What punishment did you give to him""

Then the devil replied

""I have decided that the worst way a person can suffer is to boil him in a large vat of water!""

Exited, St. Peters told the devil that he wanted to see Amda suffering with his own eyes. The devil hesitated a bit and agreed to take St Peters to Amda and both of them walked down to the torture chamber.

St Peters saw people being skinned alive, burned alive, eaten by animals, but Amda was happily playing with water in a huge vat of water sitting on top of a pile of firewood that was never being lit.

St. Peters started screaming at the Devil

""WHY THE HELL IS THAT GUY SMILING AND PLAYING WITH WATER WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT HE SHOULD SUFFER FOR THE HORRIBLE THING HE DID TO ME!""

the Devil took out a box of matches, handed it over to St. Peters and calmly replied

""Why don't you go over there, bend down and start the fire yourself.......""",[Long]Another joke from my country,54

The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, ""You're in a hot air balloon, approximately 30 feet above ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.

She rolled her eyes and said, ""You must be an Obama Democrat.

""I am,"" replied the man. ""How did you know?""

""Well,"" answered the balloonist, ""everything you told me is technically correct. But I have no idea what to do with your information, and I'm still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me.""

The man smiled and responded, ""You must be a Republican.""

Rene Descartes was the winner on this debate, arguing that since he had conciousness enough to be able to consider whether or not he existed, he must, infact exist. And he put it rather succinctly with his phrase, ""I think, therefore, I am."" 
    After coming up with this, he felt rather proud of himself, and went to his local pub to celebrate. After having a few drinks, the bartender came over to inquire if Mr. Descartes wanted another.
Descartes considered this for a second, replied, ""I think not.""

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....""

He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""

The man said, ""Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""

The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""

They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.",Nuts,45

The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name. As usual and as expected no one answered.

The professor peacefully kept the pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class. Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, ""I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.
(Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy night)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which I couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor turned to that boy and said, ""Young man I didn't get my Ph.D. in psychology by just sitting in classroom.""",One day in a well known university,60

Suddenly, from out of the gloom, comes an ominous bump...bumpâ¦bump. 

He looks behind him and spots a furtive, shadowy thing coming down the street after him. 

Unnerved, he picks up his pace, finally breaking into a panicked run.

He looks behind him again, and the shadow is closer. 

Bumpâ¦bumpâ¦bump. 

The glow of a streetlight illuminates the shadow momentarily, and, to the manâs horror, it is a coffin, bumping down the sidewalk. 

He quickens his pace, running as fast as he can go, but the coffin only pursues more quickly. 

BUMPâ¦BUMPâ¦BUMP!

He reaches his house, fumbles frantically for his keys, and slips in the door just as the coffin reaches his front steps. 

He slams the door and leans against it, catching his breath. 

Bumpâ¦bumpâ¦bump. 

There is a momentâs silence, and the man wonders if he dares to breathe.

Suddenlyâ¦. Bumpâ¦bumpâ¦bumpâ¦Bumpâ¦BUMP! BUMP! 

BUMPBUMPBUMPCRAAAAASH!!!! 

He rebounds away as the door breaks off its hinges. 

Scrambling to his feet, he charges up the stairs, and the coffin races after. 

BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP! 

Terrified, he backs into a corner and starts throwing everything within reach at the coffin â a handful of papers, a vase, a box of crackers, a lamp â but the coffin keeps coming!

BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP INCHESFROMHISFACE, and nothing seems to slow it down! 

His hands fall upon a bottle of cough syrup, and he throws that at the coffin, too!

The first friend came back with 10 apples. The bunny said, ""Shove them all up your ass and you are free to go."" The first guy began to put each apple into his butt but he died by the fourth apple.

The second friend came back a bit later and brought with him 10 oranges. The bunny gave him the same orders but the 2nd guy died after just 3 oranges up in his butt.

The third friend came back bringing 10 grapes. The bunny told him what to do and the guy started plucking each grape up his butt one after the other. When he got to the final grape, he drop dead started laughing. He was laughing so much that he ended up dying of laughter.

The third friend met the first two friends in heaven and the two friends asked him, ""Why the hell did you start laughing? You were almost there, just one more grape to go!""

A Father put his 3year old daughter to bed, told her a story and listened to her prayers which ended by saying,
âGod bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa.â
The father asked, âWhy did you say good-bye Grandpa?â
The little girl said, âI donât know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.â
The next day grandpa died.
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.
A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this,
âGod bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.â
The next day the grandmother died.
âHoly crapâ thought the father, âthis kid is in contact with the other side.â
Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, âGod bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.â
He practically went into shock. He couldnât sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.
He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.
He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.
When he got home his wife said,
âIâve never seen you work so late. Whatâs the matter?â
He said, âI donât want to talk about it, Iâve just spent the worst day of my life.â

Class starts and the teacher says: ""OK kids, today's subject will be buildings and construction.  Who can tell me how buildings are made?""  

The class remains quiet, then little Eddy raises his hand and says ""Madam, I know"". 

The teacher says, ""OK Eddy, please explain.""

Eddy:  ""Well, first before anything you need a permit from the city for the entire construction project to begin, that could take months.  Once you get the permit, then come the bulldozers to basically dig into the earth to create the foundation.  Then, cement is poured into the foundation and before it dries, large steel pylons are inserted, and this provides the building strength and framwork.  Around the pylons, the outer structure of the building is made, floors, walls, ceilings.  Then the electrical guys come and lay down all the wiring, then the plumbing guys come and lay down all the plumbing.  Next drywall can be installed along with flooring, fixtures, vents, light boxes, and doors.  When all is said and done, you still have to get an occupancy permit from the city before you can actually use the building.  

The class remains quiet.  

The teacher says:  WOW Eddy!  Bravo, that was amazing, how did you learn all that?  

Eddy:  For the past many months, just a few doors down from our house, they have been building what I think is a huge whore house, I've watched the whole thing from start to finish.

At that moment, all the girls suddenly get up and start to walk out. 

Eddy looks around and says:

Woah woah woah, girls sit down, they are not hiring yet, still waiting for final permit.
