His mistakes started to irk many of his co workers and they began to tolerate Bob less and less as the days passed, since his mess ups meant more work for them.

His trousers were magnificent. 

His leggings were amazing. 

His jeans were formidable. 

There was just one kind that he couldn’t get right and shades of the old Bob would come though. He just could not get the pattern correct before stitching. 

Seizing the opportunity, the other employees escalated this complaint to the boss.

Before the final match, the Norwegian wrestling coach came to Ole and said, ""Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian.. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished."" Ole nodded in acknowledgment.

As the match started, Ole and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbing Ole and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the coach buried his face in his hands...

Suddenly, there was a scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the coach raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and Ole collapsed on top of him making the pin and winning the match. 

The crowd went crazy. The coach was astounded. When he got his wrestler alone, he asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!"" 

Ole answered, ""Vell, I vas ready to give up ven he got me in dat hold, but at da last moment, I opened my eyes and saw dis pair of testicles right in front of my face...I had nuttin' to lose so wid my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit dose babies just as hard as I could.""

Perturbed, the patient says "" Nevermind, don't worry about that"".

Then the doctor asks ""Sir why are your balls brown?""

The patient now furious and embarrassed, dresses and storms out of the room. 

The patient pulls in to the driveway, gets out his car and starts walking to the front door. Along the way he is tripping over his kid's toys. Even more annoyed now he walks in to the house and his son runs up and hugs him with finger paint all over his little hands and wipes them on dad's pants. Kids are running amok all over the house. The place is a mess, toys and laundry piled up everywhere. By now dad is quite pissed and looks over at his wife who is changing the youngest one's diaper and says

""This place is a goddamned mess! You're a lousy housekeeper. What do you do all day?""

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool. 

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!"". 

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician. 

The spy smirks. 

""But I still think you American spy."" 

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. 

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

 The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. 

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

 ""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

The Russian politician replies, ""There aren't many black people in Russia.""","An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well-dressed middle-aged lady and was being used by her little dog. 
The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""
The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans.

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.
The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

One of the employees drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde woman returns, repays the $5000 and the interest, which comes to $17,21.

The loan officer says, “Madame I must tell you, we’re all a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and discovered that you’re a multimillionaire. Why would you bother to borrow $5,000?”

He brought it to the counter but just as he was about to pay he remembered his father's wishes to be less dirty. ""This drill won't really help us be less dirty"" he thought to himself.

Next he went to the tobacco store. After searching a while he found an amazing pipe he was sure his father would love! He brought it to the counter but just as he was about to pay he remembered his father's wishes to be less dirty. ""This pipe won't really help us be less dirty"" he thought to himself.

Disheartened he sadly wandered the streets. But fortune smiled on him and he found himself standing in front of a men's clothing store. He looked in the window and exclaimed ""That's it! The perfect gift for Father!"" He hurriedly purchased the item and brought it home to wrap.

That weekend he presented his father with the gift. As he opened it his mouth dropped open. He finally regained his composure. Turning to his son he said ""But Henry! It's so... it's so CLEAN!""

They decided that in spite of their two different specialties, they would open a practice together to share office space and personnel.

Dr. Smith was a psychiatrist and Dr. Jones was a proctologist; they put up a sign reading: Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones: Hysterias and Posteriors. The town council was livid and insisted they change it.

The docs changed it to read: Schizoids and Hemorrhoids. This was also not acceptable so they again changed the sign to read Catatonics and High Colonics - no go. Next they tried Manic Depressives and Anal Retentives - thumbs down again.

They came up with Queers and Rears. That didn't satisfy the town council either.

Then came Minds and Behinds - still no good. Another attempt resulted in Lost Souls and Butt Holes - unacceptable again! So they tried Nuts and Butts - no way. Freaks and Cheeks - still no good. Loons and Moons - forget it. Almost at their wit's end, the docs finally came up with:

couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighbourhood after they retired.

Holding hands they walked back to their old school.

It was not locked, so they entered, and found the old desk they'd
shared, where Andy had carved 'I love you, Sally.'

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armoured car,
practically landing at their feet.
Sally quickly picked it up, but not sure what to do with it, they took
it home.
There, she counted the money-fifty-thousand dollars.

Andy said, 'We've got to give it back'.

Sally said, 'Finders keepers.' She put the money back in the bag and

hid it in their attic.

The next day, two FBI men were canvassing the neighbourhool looking

for the money, and knocked on the door.

'Pardo n me, but did either of you find a bag that fell out of an
armoured car yesterday?'

Sally said, 'No'.

Andy said, 'She's lying. She hid it up in the attic'

The agents turn to Andy and began to question him.

One say: 'Tell us the story from the beginning.'

Andy said, 'Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school
yesterday...'

We had just finished a mission and field maintenance and had about an hour of down-time before our next briefing, so the whole platoon was in a tent sitting on cots in a circle just bullshitting. One of the sergeants, a particularly vulgar guy, starts telling some nasty and offensive jokes which starts the whole platoon off on a spree of similar jokes. We had a Lieutenant, my LT, who was not a fan of these kinds of jokes and was getting aggravated as each joke began to get more and more vulgar. Every joke we knew from blonde to women to racist to dead baby jokes and he would openly display his dislike for these jokes with comments like, ""that's not funny,"" or, ""that's just wrong."" Eventually, he had hit his limit right after a PFC told a holocaust joke, saying, ""why did Hitler really kill himself?"" One of the other sergeants asked, ""why?"" The private responded with, ""because of the gas bill."" At this point, the LT was very disturbed and stated, ""do you know how horrible that is? Millions of people died in camps and you are laughing about being gassed?"" One of the other privates who hadn't done much talking immediately says to the LT, ""yeah sir, my grandfather died in a concentration camp."" Everyone kind of gets quiet because we weren't sure really what to say, the LT looks at him and puts a hand on his shoulder and says, ""I'm so terribly sorry for how insensitive everyone was being towards you, I sincerely apologize for the whole platoon."" Without missing a beat in an amazingly deadpan poker face, the private looks at my LT and says, ""the drunk bastard fell out of a guardtower."" The entire platoon was falling out of cots, rolling on the floor laughing to the point of crying at that magnificent set-up. The LT just stands up, says ""watch my cot,"" and walks out of the tent. The laughter must have continued for about 5 minutes.

The LT eventually came around and understood, he's going to be around soldiers and these jokes will be told. I'm sure the ""drunk bastard"" line for that joke has been used, but in that situation, it was absolutely hilarious.",The best situation set-up I've ever heard in real life....,5

The landowner assured him that the bees were completely harmless, but the buyer would have no part of it. 

Finally, the landowner made an offer. The buyer would allow himself to be tied to a tree for an hour, nude, under the nest. So sure of the friendliness of his bees was the farmer that if ONE bee were to sting him, the farm would be his for free. The buyer thought it over and decided it was worth the risk. 

An hour later, the farmer walked out to the tree and saw the poor guy slumped over in his bindings. Fearing the worst, he ran up to him and asked if he had been stung.

In WWI, two soldiers were selected from their platoon to lead the charge on the enemy trench lines. Knowing that they would likely die the next day, the men decided they would spend the day drinking the best alcohol and smoking the best cigars. They walked up and down the trench lines, asking for a last drink or cigarette. Due to supply shortages, all the men could find was cheap alcohol and homemade cigs. Wanting something better, the men began asking in tents and infirmeries for real alcohol and quality cigars. 

Inside the infimary, the medics refused to give up any alcohol as they needed it for their patients. Knowing that they would far outlive the grunt men, the communications officers refused to give up any of the expensive cigarettes in their tent. Lastly, coming to the officer’s tent, both men were given each a shot of expensive whiskey and sent on their way.

Unsatisified, they grumbled back to their tents and slept for the night.

During the next day’s charge, both of the men were wounded and fell into the same foxhole. 

“Damn,” said the first, “really wish I could’ve had one last smoke before I die.”

“Lucky for you, I snuck into the officers tent and stole a pack of smokes in the night,” replied the second.

“Alright! Pass me one!” 

Doing so, both men looked at the cigarettes in the cartoon before realizing they were homemade. Garbage.

“Goddammit! I thought I told you!”

“What?”

“The real smoke is always in the com tent!”

post,818p4t,2qh72,jokes,false,1519937957,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/818p4t/going_to_heaven/,self.jokes,,"One day, three men died and went to hell. Satan was there and the three guys asked to be sent to heaven. However, Satan said that only the good people can go to heaven. So he let them give him a question each. If Satan can answer their questions correctly, the person will stay in Hell; but if Satan didn't answer it correctly the person can go to Heaven. 

So the first person tries. He was a Mathematician, and he gave Satan a very tough maths formula. But Satan solved it in no time. So the mathematician goes to Hell.

The second person, who happens to be a scientist, gave it a try. He asked Satan to prove a very difficult Science question involving Quantum Theory and Newton's law and whatever sh*t in between. Once again Satan managed to answer correctly, so the man goes to Hell.

The last guy goes forward. He was an Engineer, so Satan laughed at him. Nonetheless, he asked to be given a chair and an electric drill, and he was given those things. So he drilled five identical holes in a circle in the middle of the chair, sat on the chair and farted.

He asked Satan, ""Which hole did I fart through?"" 

Satan examined the chair and measured the diameter of every hole. He turned the chair in every way possible. Finally, he said exasperated, ""this hole"", pointing to the fifth hole. 

""WRONG!!... Haha... I farted through my ASSHOLE!!!.... I go to Heaven!!!""",Going to Heaven,7

""Yes!"" The Labrador replies.

After recovering from the shock of hearing the dog talk, he man asks, ""So, tell me your story!""
The Labrador looks up and says, 
""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I joined  the SAS.

""In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a dog would be eavesdropping.

I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years, But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Heathrow to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. 

I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired!""
The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the dog.

""Ten quid!"" The owner says.
""£10? But this dog is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""

While riding my Harley, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.

Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, ""Are you okay?""

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for...

""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

As a retirement gift to himself he took the collected foreskins to a leather craftsman and asked him to make something with them.

The leatherman looked at the collection and thought for a bit, and said ""sure, sure... come back in two weeks.""

Two weeks passes and the Rabbi returns to the leatherman's shop and is greeted by the craftsman.  ""Good morning Rabbi"" says the leatherman, I have your gift ready for you, and he pulls out from under the counter a wallet and presents it to the Rabbi.

The Rabbi picks it up and examines for a it a moment and sets it down. He looks at the leatherman and asks ""is this the best you could do?  All those foreskins, it seems so small, such a waste of material.  I'm not so sure I am pleased by this result.""

The leatherman smiles and says ""Rabbi, while it may seem like a small wallet, if you rub it, it becomes a briefcase.""

I was maybe 9 or 10 and I grabbed the outside of one of the ""legs"" and started climbing. I made my way up higher and higher wondering if I'd ever get to the top. About 30 minutes into my climb, it started to rain.


The rain was light at first, but picked up as I made it almost 3/4 of the way up. It started getting tough to hang on, but I thought 'if I could just get another 25 feet up, I'm gonna make it.'


As I got a few mere feet from the platform up top, the rain was pouring. I felt my right hand slipping, but I tried to persist anyway.


Bad idea. I slipped off and fell the entire way down. I thought I was going to die when all of a sudden, I landed on my back, rolled over, and walked back to my parents.


""Are you okay!?!?!"" They looked like they had just seen a ghost.

""I'm fine,"" I replied. ""It's a good thing I was wearing my *light fall jacket*.","When I was younger, I climbed the Eiffel Tower.",0

One day, while they were walking, they passed the hospital swimming pool and Leonard suddenly dove into the deep end. He sank to the bottom and stayed there.

David promptly jumped in and saved him, swimming to the bottom of the pool and pulling Leonard out. The medical director came to know of David’s heroic act. He immediately ordered that David be discharged from the hospital as he now considered him to be OK.

The doctor said, “David, we have good news and bad news for you! The good news is that we are going to discharge you because you have regained your sanity. Since you were able to jump in and save another patient, you must be mentally stable. The bad news is that the patient that you saved hung himself in the bathroom and died after all.”

Another answers, ""Pierre.""
The young recruit gets up, puts his rifle on the edge of the trench, aims, then shouts, ""Pierre!!""
From the other trench, a blue helmed head pops up, and answeres, ""Oui?""
*Bang!* The frenchman falls over dead.
The german shouts again, ""Pierre!!""
Another french man looks up, asking ""Oui?""
*Bang!* He is dead as well.
This continues for another half an hour, with the germans having a whale of a good time.

The french commanders stick their heads together.
""This can't continue! Our men are dying like flies!""
""Can't we turn that tactic on them, as well?""
The french think.
""What's a typical German name?""
""Erich.""
They decide to try it out immediatly. They send a soldier out with their new master plan. He get's his rifle, nervously peeks out of the trench at the german line, then shouts: ""Erich!!""
Nothing happens.
He shouts again, ""Erich!!""
Still, no answer.
Slightly annoyed, he shouts louder. ""ERICH!!""
