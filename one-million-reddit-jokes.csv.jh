As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus.

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time she attempted the step, and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!'

However, there's a catch - the town's richest man owns a lot of property, including the sea and all its beaches. The rich man is somewhat paranoid of people trespassing on his property, so he has a private police force. The police are split into 4 teams, named Police A through D.

So, the murderer goes to dispose of his corpse. He sneaks past the security and steals a boat, which he takes out onto the water. However, the police notice that the boat is missing and send out their teams to find it and catch the thief.

As the murderer is just about to head back, he sees Police A's boat in the distance. ""Stay where you are and put your hands above your head!"" shouts the boat's captain over a megaphone. The murderer doesn't let him finish before gunning the throttle and sailing off. Police A's boat tries to give chase, but it's an older one and soon the murderer has escaped from them.

Just as the criminal loses sight of Police A's boat, he sees Police B's boat up ahead. He turns around and continues to sail away. Police B's boat is too old to keep up, and soon they lose him.

The murderer realizes he has escaped from Police A and Police B. He begins to make his way back to shore, when he sees the third police team on the horizon. He tries to escape, but their boat is too fast and he is caught. As he's being taken away, he says ""how did I get caught after I outran Police A and Police B so easily?

Leroy was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating shrimp, oysters and BBQ and flirting with all the women.

At the height of the party, the host said, 'I have a 10 foot man-eating gator in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who has the nerve to jump in.'
 
The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.
 
Everyone turned around and saw Leroy in the pool! Leroy was fighting the gator and kicking its ass! Leroy was jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butts and choke holds, biting the gator on the tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of judo instructor.
 
The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Leroy and the gator were screaming and raising hell. Finally Leroy strangled the gator and let it float to the top like a dime store goldfish. Leroy then slowly climbed out of the pool.
 
Everybody was just staring at him in disbelief.
 
Finally the host says, 'Well, Leroy, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.'

'No, that's okay. I don't want it,' said Leroy.
 
The rich man said, 'Man, I have to give you something. You won the bet. How about half a million bucks then?'
 
No thanks, I don't want it,' answered Leroy.
 
The host said, 'Come on, I insist on giving you something! That was amazing!
 
How about a new Porsche and a Rolex and some stock options?'
 
Again Leroy said no.
 
Confused, the rich man asked, 'Well, Leroy, then what do you want?'
 
Leroy said, 'I want the name of the sumbich who pushed me in the pool!'","A filthy rich Florida man decided that he wanted to throw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbors. He also invited Leroy, the only redneck in the neighborhood.",2714

Firstly they met with the timid rabbits, and ask ""Hello Mr and Mrs Rabbit, can we have your property?"" And the rabbits curl in fear and exclaim ""Of course! Just please don't hurt us!"" Because with a mere request, rabbits will give a burrow.

The lions then move forward with their conquest to the monkeys, swinging above them, and the lions ask, ""Hello Mr and Mrs Monkey, can we have your property?"" And the monkeys confused say, ""What? Of course not, this is our home, you can't just walk up here, ask for our land and just expect to just get it."" And the lion smirks and begins to scrap rabbit meat out from his teeth and says, in a confident, condescending tone, ""Well. . . It looks like we'll have to take it by force."" The monkey sighs, accepting the fact that he can't defeat the lions in a brawl and gives up what he owns. Because maybe not with a mere request, but when push comes to shove, monkeys will give a tree.

Confident in their mission, the lions decide to finish their day with a visit to the beavers. The lions ask of them ""Hello Mr and Mrs Beaver, can we have your property?"" The beaver offended beyond belief yell ""What did you just say?! Are you serious?! You want to claim our land?! Our homes?! Of course not! We build this! It isn't just a hole in the ground, or a sprout from the ground! We had to collect wood, and build this on a moving water source! Do you have any idea how difficult that is?!""

The beaver bares his large buck teeth at the beasts and slowly begins pacing towards them, ""Go on then! Kill us! You'll have to! Because the only way you're getting our homes, is from our cool, dead beaver hands!""

After the UN address, the pope was given a chauffeur driven limo to get to MSG in time for the mass.  Leaving the UN, he ran into New York City bumper-to-bumper traffic, and was stuck with the time for mass fast approaching.  

The pope is a very patient man, but he did not want to disappoint his many followers by being late to the mass.  After waiting in traffic for a period of time, he rolled down the privacy window and said to the limo driver, “I don’t want to be late for mass, I have driven many times in the Beunos Aires traffic, and know how to get around, why don’t you let me drive, and you sit here in the back.”  

After protests from the limo driver, the pope finally convinced him to switch place, and got behind the wheel.

The pope immediately turned the wrong way up a one-way street, and drove up on the side walk, knocking over parking meters, scrambling pedestrians, but making good time to MSG.  He passed a police cruiser, who immediately turned on his lights and siren and pulled him over.

The police in driver’s seat got out of the car to investigate what was going on, while his partner in the passenger seat ran the license plate through the in-car computer.  

The police man walked up to window, tapped on it, and asked for, “License and registration.”

The pope, in his flowing robe, rolled down the window and blessed the police officer, and drove off to complete his journey.

The police officer walked back to his car, and sat down without saying a word.  

His partner asked, “Why did you just let him go?  Who was that, the Mayor, the Governor, the President???”

The first officer said, “I don’t know for sure who it was, but he has the pope driving him.”

The two fought together throughout the war and both made it home safely.

After the war, the two returned to their respective homes and decided to marry their respective sweethearts.  The two became such good friends that they decided to honeymoon together in neighboring beach houses in Florida.

After arriving for their honeymoon, the two met outside and decided to make a gentleman's bet.  Whoever could make love to his wife more times that night would be the winner and have bragging rights.  The two agreed to meet the next morning on the beach to see who the winner was. They shook hands and returned to their new wives for a fun night.

Bright and early the next morning, the American emerged from his little cottage. He was exhausted, barely able to keep his eyes open! He trudged towards the beach, his footsteps dragging heavily through the sand.  As he neared the beach he collapsed to his knees, crawling the rest of the way.  With his last ounce of strength, he carved 3 dashes into the sand to let the Canadian soldier he had made it with his wife 3 times.  As he finished the last dash, he passed out.

A few minutes later, the Canadian soldier emerged. He had a big grin on his face and he was full of energy! He was skipping and doing cartwheels as he made his way down to the beach, eager to see how his American friend had fared.  He spied where his friend lied in the sand and dashed over to him. His eyes went wide as he saw the three dashes in the sand, slapping his hand to his forehead as he exclaimed, ""One hundred and eleven!? Shucks, he beat me by five!""

And that's the difference between Canadian and American men! xD

As he walked through the forest, following the trail of blood, the police officer noticed a fur\-covered pile, soaked in blood. It was another bear, with a few of its limbs missing. The police officer continued until he began to hear footsteps.

Through the trees he saw another man carrying a large sack, blood dripping from the bottom. The police officer ran in front of him, and pointed his gun directly at the man holding the sack.

Since he wasn't physically impaired, he remained on flight status and eventually became an Admiral.  However, during his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.
 
One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Sergeant Major for his personal staff.
 
The first Master Chief was a surface Navy type and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, ""Do you notice anything different about me?""
 
The Master Chief answered, ""Why, yes, Admiral. I couldn't help but notice that you are missing your starboard ear, so I don't know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.""
 
The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office.
 
The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, ""Well yes, Sir, you seem to be short one ear."" The Admiral threw him out as well.
 
The third interview was with the Marine Sergeant Major. He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Navy Master Chiefs put together. The Admiral wanted this guy, but went ahead with the same question. ""Do you notice anything different about me?""
 
To his surprise, the Sergeant Major said, ""Yes Sir You wear contact lenses.""
 
The Admiral was impressed and thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. ""And how would you know that?"" the Admiral asked.

During the last class of the day, which coincidentally happened to be history, as soon as the bell rang for dismissal, Miss Stevens calls out to the class; 

""Alright students, make sure your homework is finished for third period tomorrow. Johnny please stay back, I need to have a word with you.""

With the classroom now empty except for Miss Stevens and Johnny, she motions him to approach her desk. Knowing how simple Johnny is, she doesn't beat around the bush.

""Look Johnny, I'm going to be honest with you. There is a rumor going around the school that you have a huge dick. Is this true?""

Johnny nonchalantly replies; 

""Yes mam, that is true.""

Miss Stevens then with a smile, pulls up her skirt and points to her vagina;

""Alright Johnny, I want you to put your penis into here.""

Johnny frowns and replies;

""Sorry Miss Stevens, my dad told me those things have teeth.""

Miss Stevens, undeterred produces a wooden broom handle from the maintenance cupboard in the classroom and begins stimulating herself with it, she lets out a fart accidentally but plays it off like nothing happened. She takes the broom handle out, shows Johnny that there aren't any teeth marks on the broom handle;

""See Johnny, your dad was lying to you, they don't have teeth, you have nothing to worry about.""

Johnny now has a terrified expression on his face and replies;

""If it growled at a piece of wood, I can only imagine what it would do to human flesh!""

trying to sue my client.  I believe he is a fraud.  Please tell him to simply answer the question. “

he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie.”

They do some research online, and find out that if you call the hospital, sometimes they'll lower your bill if you can prove that you have Financial hardships. The wife calls the hospital, since the insurance is in her name. After about 3 hours of being on hold and speaking to people in billing, she come out of their home office and talks to her husband, who is slightly distracted by playing video games.

She says ""I have good news and I have bad news. The good news is, I was able to get them to reduce our bill to $17,000. The bad news is, there's nothing they can do about that $9,000 charge for ""Love"". I did find out what it was all about, though, apparently that's the label that they give to their charge for an epidural.""

Five hours later they staggered out of the theme park. Her head was reeling and her stomach felt upside 
down. He then took her to a McDonald's where he ordered her a Happy Meal with extra fries and a 
chocolate shake.

Then it was off to a movie, popcorn, a soda pop, and her favourite candy, M&amp;M's. What a fabulous adventure! 

Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed into bed exhausted.

“What’s wrong with them?” asks the shop owner. 

“Well you see,” says the Dutchman, “these are my work boots. They’re getting worn out and have some holes in them. Could you fix them up?” 

The owner had never fixed wooden shoes, but he figured it would be a good experience working on them. So he agrees and spends the next week fixing the clogs. It’s the hardest and most difficult shoe repair he’s done, seeing as he’s not a carpenter, but he manages. 

The man comes back to pick up his shoes and is quite satisfied by the work done on them. A few weeks go by, and then a group of 3 men show up, each with clogs that are full of holes. 

One of the men explains, “you did such a good job fixing my coworker’s work boots that we all figured we’d bring ours to you to fix as well.” 

The cobbler isn’t too excited, seeing how difficult it will be, but money is money so he agrees. This time it takes him 3 weeks of nonstop work to repair the clogs. The men come back and pick up their shoes, satisfied with the work done on them. 

Now being famous for fixing wooden shoes, people start coming from all over to get their clogs repaired, since no other cobbler offers that service. It’s grueling work and the cobbler starts to get real tired of it. 

Finally, he has a breaking point when a massive group of workers show up with their clogs full of holes wanting them to be fixed.

I thought you were bringing her back.” The trooper frowns. “That’s a repost, sir. You’re under arrest. I’m afraid I have to take you to r/jokes jail.”

&amp;nbsp;

On his first day in Joke Jail, the old man enters the prison yard to see a long, single-file line of inmates. A single guard stands at the front, heavily muscled and covered in tattoos. He points at a man in a nun’s costume. “Who’re you?” the guard asks. The man replies, “I’m the bus driver!” Before anyone can react, the guard begins to pummel the bus driver, beating him into unconsciousness. Next in line is a small chicken. The guard looks down, “Why are you here?” The chicken replies, “I crossed the road.” The guard beats the chicken into unconsciousness as well. The old man reaches the front of the line, and barely stammers out the reason for his arrest before he, too, is badly beaten.

&amp;nbsp;

Day after day this goes on, with the senior citizen wearily growing used to the routine. After almost a year, though, the old man enters the prison yard, only to find that the guard is absent. The man begins to panic, tearing at his hair and clothes. The bus driver ambles up: “Is somethin’ the matter, old man?”

First one he picks up. In a room, after some kissing, he takes his pants off and asks a girl ''what is this?''. She says \- ''it's a dick''. He was disgusted by her vulgarity, had sex anyway but never contacted her again.

Next day he picks up another one. In a room, same story, ''what's this?'', ''obviously a dick lol''. Another disappointment and another meaningless sex with a stranger.

Many months passed and many women were plowed after giving the wrong answer. But one day \- magic! He picked up a beautiful, gracious girl and brought her in.

''What is this'' said he, after taking his pants off.

''I ...i don't know, honestly''.

Saint Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know Forrest. But, the test I have for you is only three questions. Here is the first: What days of the week begin with the letter ‘T’? Second, how many seconds are there in a year? Third, what is God’s first name?""

Forrest goes away to think the questions over. He returns the next day and goes up to Saint Peter to try to answer the exam questions.

Saint Peter waves him up and asks, ""Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.""

Forrest says, ""Well, the first one, -how many days of the week begin with the letter ‘T’?"" ""Shucks, that one’s easy; that’d be Today and Tomorrow!""

The saint’s eyes open wide and he exclaims, ""Forrest! That’s not what I was thinking, but ... you do have a point though, and I guess I didn’t specify, so I give you credit for that answer.""

""How about the next one"" says Saint Peter, ""how many seconds in a year?""

""Now that one’s harder,"" says Forrest. ""But, I thunk and thunk about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.""

Astounded, Saint Peter says, ""Twelve! Twelve! Forrest, how in Heaven’s name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?""

Forrest says, ""Shucks, there gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second....""

""Hold it,"" interrupts Saint Peter. ""I see where you’re going with it.""

""And I guess I see your point, though that wasn’t quite what I had in mind.

I’ll give you credit for that one too.""

""Let’s go on with the next and final question,"" says Saint Peter, ""Can you tell me God’s first name?""

Forest says, ""Well shore, I know God’s first name. Everybody probly knows It’s Howard.""

""Howard?"" asks Saint Peter. ""What makes you think it’s ‘Howard’?""

Forest answers, ""It’s in the prayer.""

""The prayer?"" asks Saint Peter, ""Which prayer?""

""The Lord’s Prayer,"" responds Forest: ""Our Father, Who art in Heaven, Howard be thy name...""

“Okay fine, one thousand dollars? Cmon”
The girl stops and looks around for a second and thinks about it. 
“Let’s see the money”
The guy pulls out a thousand dollars and says she can have it once he bites her nipples.
The girl finally agrees and they move to the side and the girl pulls up her shirt. The guy is just loving it and he’s going at it, licking and sucking and just enjoying her breasts.

After a few minutes the girl asks him
“Hey, aren’t you going to bite my nipples?”
Guy yells out 
“FUCK NO! That shit is way too expensive!”

As he walks through backstreets he stumbles into a stunning brothel with the most gorgeous women he had ever seen.

""Please come in and make yourself at home."" said the madam at the front desk.

""It just so happens that I got paid today and I want your deluxe treatment."" boasts the man.

""Well you're in luck. We're running a special this week. I have just the thing."" said the madam

They walk into a huge room with silk sheets, chilled champagne, and a big mirror on the ceiling. He settles into bed and the most beautiful woman he has ever seen walks in. And  they go at it all night. 

The next week the man returns. He stumbles through the door looking a little worse for wear.

""Listen, my wife found out what I did in here. She kicked me out of the house. She won't let me see the kids. And she canceled all my credit cards. But I had such an amazing time in here I have $10 to my name but I have to know if there is anything I can get for it.""

""Well I don't know sir we're kinda a high end place, but let me go check."" says the madam. A couple minutes later she returns. ""sir it's your lucky day we're actually are running a special this week. I have just the thing."" 

They go to a smaller room and the only things in there are a table, a mirror on the wall, and a chicken sitting on the table.

The woman gestures to the chicken ""for 10 dollars this is whatcha get.""

The man thinks on it for a second and says fuck it and goes wild on the chicken.

The next week the man returns. He busts through the door looking worse than ever.

""I'm broke, I have nothing except 2 dollars. My life is falling apart but I have such an amazing time these last two weeks I have to know what I can get for it."" the man pleads.

""Well sir it's your lucky day we're running a special this week and I have just the thing""

They go off to a room with a couple rows of chairs and a window peering into another room. The woman gestures for the man to sit down. More chairs fill up and then a couple minutes later two absolutely stunning women walk in the other room and just start going at it.
