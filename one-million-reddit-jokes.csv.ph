Finally the last boy sees an abandoned railroad tie nearby and all three of the boys drag it to the well.  In one, mighty effort they hoist it up and drop it in.  They wait.

SUDDENLY a goat comes tearing out of the woods and dives head first into the well.  The boys stare at each other, slack-jawed until a farmer's voice interrupts their stunned silence.

""Have you boys seen a goat?  He should be right around here somewhere.""  The boys awkwardly try to explain that a goat jumped into the well and that they absolutely had nothing to do with it.

He calls over the bartender and starts to order, but the bartender swiftly points to a sign on the wall behind the bar that says in big bold letters: ""WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ROPES."" The rope, rather startled, starts to haggle with the bartender: ""Come on, man! It's been a long day, I just need to unwind with a nice drink. Can't you fix me up?""The bartender shakes his head and informs the rope that if he doesn't leave the bar, the bouncer will escort him out. The rope, not having any of it, continues to argue with the bartender, so the bartender calls over the bouncer and has the rope escorted out of the bar. The rope heads home, a little dejected, and decides to call it a night, hoping for better luck the next day.


So, the next day, the rope has a good day at work, and decides to take his buddies out for a round of drinking that night. They go to the same bar as before, and call over the bartender to order some drinks for the night. The bartender arrives and explains the bar's policy again: ""No ropes allowed, no exceptions. Leave on your own accord or you will be assisted."" The rope refuses to leave, protesting the bar's absurd policy against ropes, and is promptly forced out of the bar by the bouncer. His pals don't follow him out, and he heads home alone, thirsty and sad, now only looking forward to the late-night marathon of M\*A\*S\*H.


The next day, the rope meets back up with his friends at work, who bought him a cake to make up for his sorrows the night before. By the time he's through with work, the rope is completely revitalized and ready to take on the bar again. He heads back over, completely confident in himself, and sits down at the counter, calls over the bartender, and asks for the biggest, baddest beer in the house. The bartender, unamused and completely fed up with the rope, points to the 'no-ropes' sign, and explains to the rope: ""You are not welcome here under any circumstances. I don't know what keeps leading you to believe that you can or will be served here, but you are wrong, and the bouncer will prove that to you if you don't leave right now."" The rope adamantly refuses to leave the bar, so the bouncer takes him around back, behind the bar. After a few heavy blows to the rope, the bouncer throws him out into the street and tells him to get lost. The rope goes home and cries himself to sleep that night, questioning how a world so discriminatory against ropes could even come to exist.


The next day, the rope stays home and mopes around his place, not in the mood for anything at all. He stays miserable the entire day, and doesn't bother to do anything about his now-disheveled appearance. Evening rolls around, and the rope gets sick of his own home and sets out to the streets to have a night on the town. He passes by the same bar as before and decides to stop by, sitting down at the counter and calling over the bartender. The bartender, well aware of the rope's stubborn nature, immediately walks over, and says, ""Oh, you again. The big, bad rope. Looks like my bouncer roughed you up pretty good! I bet you want something to drink tonight, huh?""

&amp;nbsp;

The rope chuckles and lets out a heavy sigh, and says ""Actually, I'm a frayed knot.""","So, a rope walks into a bar...",0

The lesson plan called for going over the ABCs, so the substitute called on little Cathy to say a word that began with the letter A. Johnny raised his hand to answer but the substitute teacher knew better than that.

Cathy said,
""A is for apple.""

For the letter B, Johnny again raised his hand, but the substitute held firm on her instructions.

Alex was called on and politely said,
""B is for baseball.""

This continued for nearly the whole alphabet with little Johnny raising his hand every time. Finally the class got to the letter R. Again, Johnny raised his hand. Now at this point, the substitute felt bad for Johnny and couldn't think of a bad word that started with the letter R.

So she called on Johnny, who took a deep breath and sweetly said,

Tired and looking for just one last kill, he scanned the forest.

""Look at me, I own the Hoover Dam and I can't even find one last animal."" He thought.

Then, suddenly, a deer sprang into view. The deer looked very distressed, but the hunter took no notice. The hunter slowly crept toward it until he was in range. Suddenly, the deer bounded toward him, frightening the hunter nearly to death. Then to the shock of the hunter, the deer spoke.

""Please! Please help me! Our dam has broken and the forest is flooding!"" The deer shouted.

Now that the hunter was closer he saw that there was a name tag on the deer, it read ""Frank Lee"".

""Your name is Frank Lee?"" The man asked, distracted by the fact that a deer had a name.

""Yes but my name doesn't matter right now, we need you to help us fix the dam!"" The deer cried. ""You're the only human we've seen out here, and we don't know when there will be another.""

""Well, it's just your luck the I own the Hoover Dam!"" the man said, reaching the straighten his tie, and then realizing he was wearing his hunting outfit.

""That's perfect! What luck! Hooray! Although there is one, um, problem."" Said the deer.

""And what would that be?"" The man said, excited at the prospect of building a new dam. He had grown rather proud of his Hoover Dam, but to own two dams, that would be even better.

""Um, since we're animals, you see, um, we, uh, don't have any money."" The deer said sheepishly.

""No money?!"" The man exclaimed. ""How do you expect me to build it then?""

""Uh, we were uh, hoping you'd do it for free, sir."" The deer replied, even more sheepish than before.

The man laughed. And laughed. And laughed and laughed and continued to laugh for a good five minutes.

""Frank Lee, my deer, I don't give a dam."" The man said.

Bear shakes his head: ""Squirrel, you don't know how to wish."" Genie then asked the bear for his second wish. Bear responds: ""All right, I want all the other bears in the COUNTRY to be females."" Genie grants the wish.

Genie turns to squirrel: ""How about it?"" Squirrel responds: ""Gimme a motorcycle helmet.""

Bear shakes his head again. ""What's wrong with you?"" Genie then turns once more to bear and asked for final wish. ""You know what? I want all the other bears in the WORLD to be female."" Genie grants the wish, then turns to squirrel.

post,5wch3s,2qh72,jokes,false,1488143715,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5wch3s/timmy_and_his_duck/,self.jokes,,"A young boy is about to go to school, so he grabs his books and backpack, nearly forgetting his wooden duck decoy that he needed for show and tell. He grabs it and runs out the door. His mother reminds him: ""Be careful with that duck, Timmy, it belonged to your grandfather.""

As he walks to school, a woman runs out of a house and stops him. ""Hey kid, if you give me that duck, I'll let you have sex with me."" He does what any pubescent boy would do in that situation, of course, and nods very energetically. He does the deed and manages to get to school on time as well.

As the day goes by, he realizes that wasn't such a good idea. He'd get an F in the class without something for show and tell, and his mother would be so disappointed in him for losing the decoy. So, he makes a plan. At lunch, he sneaks out of school and goes back to the woman's house. He knocks fiercely on the door until she answers, and he asks if he can have the duck back. She agrees, as long as he has sex with her again. He nods, slightly less energetically, but does the deed quickly due to his youthful rebound.

He makes it back to school on time, and has a successful show and tell. On his way home, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk and the decoy goes flying out into the street. Timmy's life flashes before his eyes as a pickup truck runs it over, shredding it to a pulp. The driver pulls over and gets out of the truck. He says, ""I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to repay ya, but all I've got is this dollar."" So he takes the dollar and walks home, devastated.

He arrives at his front door, terrified of his mother's possible reaction. But he decides that if she asks, he will tell her the truth.

Immediately, she greets him, asking how his day went. Timmy is quiet. So she finally inquires: ""What happened to the decoy?"" Timmy responds.

""Well - I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and a buck for a fucked up duck.""",Timmy and his duck.,11

post,5wcf05,2qh72,jokes,false,1488143090,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5wcf05/appolcolypse/,self.jokes,,"A zombie apocalypse had enveloped the earth. 99.9% of the world’s population had been annihilated and Carl, lone survivor, was venturing the land looking for somewhere to take shelter.

One day, he came across a prison. The place was full of people armed with swords, spears, axes and all kinds of hand held weaponry. The settlers took him in and after a while he finally felt safe.

One night, they heard loud groans start to surround the place. Zombies had broken in and after a few minutes had overrun the prison. The settlers did all they could but their weapons just weren’t up to the task and everyone was killed, apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who escaped as the last few were eaten alive.

Stumbling through the night, with zombies close behind in trail, Carl discovered a huge shopping mall. The settlers let him inside. They were armed to the teeth with a huge arsenal of Pistols, assault rifles, military grade weapons, the lot.

Carl warned them that there was a pack of zombies following him, but when they looked hundreds had gathered behind Carl and were now headed straight for the mall. The settlers fired every weapon they had at them, but wave after wave of zombies ploughed on through the wall of bullets and the settlers of the shopping mall were slaughtered. All apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who eluded death once again.

He ventured into a deep dark wood, stumbling over fallen foliage, with an Armageddon of zombies behind him, he ran into a huge wooden wall. As he got closer to the entrance, he saw a chicken dressed in military fatigues. The chicken scratched its feet on the floor, clucked three times and pecked on the huge wooden gates. They opened with an enormous “Creeeeek”. Inside was a farm, an old redneck farmer and his wife. “nice ta meet ya sonny”, said the farmer, “come on in ayn' have ay drink”

Carl quickly warned them that there were hundreds of zombies chasing him, maybe even thousands by now, but they didn’t seem bothered at all. “Shouldn’t we do something? Haven’t you even got any weapons at all” Carl shouted... 

“Naw, we won't need em”, said the farmer

“The chick’n will deal with em” said his wife, calmly.

Carl was anxious, but he was fed up of running and wanted to see what this chicken could do, so he watched in anticipation... 

The Zombies approached, and one by one the chicken took them down. It pecked through their zombie brains, scratched off their heads and kicked the living dead crap out of thousands of them.

Amazed, Carl said, “I’ve just seen that group of zombies tear through two settlements, both armed to the teeth with an incredible arsenal of weapons, and your chicken has just taken all of them all out single handed, how? how did that just happen!?”

“Well”, said the farmer, “we figured it’out a lon lon time ago. We dun' need any weapon’s at all, for the Hen is mightier than the Horde.”

''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner. However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited: Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour!

“I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from his employer; had an affair with his boss’s wife; had sex with his boss’s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.
I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.”

Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:
“I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,” said the politician. “In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.”",A priest is being honored at his retirement dinner.,179

He approaches St. Peter and says: "" From now on, the only way to get into heaven is for someone to die in an interesting way, I'll leave it to you to figure out what fits.""

The first day the new policy is in place St Peter explains the rule to the first guy who begins to tell his tale: ""St Peter, I'm a devoted husband, I love my wife but I could have been more attentive. One day I decide to surprise her at home early with some flowers. I walk in our bedroom to find her naked, the sheets a mess and a look of surprise on her face.""

He's holding onto the edge of our sixth floor apartment's balcony. I go over, shouting at him and stomping on his fingers. He pleads with me and yells back but he falls, all the way down. But he lands in some hedge bushes and LIVES. Well, I'm so upset and enraged I go to the kitchen. I lift the REFRIGERATOR up, and throw it over the balcony. The fridge lands on him and kills him. The rush was too much for my heart, I have a heart attack and die..."" St. Peter, surprised at the story saw no problem at letting the man in Heaven.

As the day goes on St Peter hears more stories, some good, some bad. Then quite unexpectedly he hears one that catches his attention... ""Well St. Peter, I work out a lot, and take fitness seriously. One day I'm running on my treadmill in my apartment. I work up a good sweat and felt pretty good. Suddenly my treadmill starts speeding up. Panicked, I slip. I tumble backwards, over my balcony. By the grace of God I manage to grab onto the balcony beneath me. THEN OUT OF NOWHERE this fat asshole starts screaming at me, stamping on my fingers and calling me a all sorts of names. I lose my grip and fall all the way down to the ground. By some great fortune I live... then a goddamn REFRIGERATOR falls on me...."" St. Peter, mouth agape at the incredible coincidence, decides the man has earned his entry and lets him on his way.

The day winds down and St Peter sees off the last of those eager to enter the Pearly Gates. Just as hes about to shut down for the day one last soul arrives. After a quick explanation of the new policy, the man gets a big, wide grin across his face. "" OK St. Peter, are you ready for this? I'm naked, right? and hiding in a refrigerator...""

He thinks, ""that's okay, she's worth it,"" and waits an hour in the flower line. 

Next he goes to the candy store to get some really nice chocolates and again, the line is absurdly long. Again he thinks, ""that's okay, I'll wait,"" and waits an hour in the chocolate line. 

He goes to a limo agency to book a limo for prom night, but they are having a sale so many engaged couples have lined up to book a limo. But the line is shorter than the candy store line and the boy thinks, ""well, if I waited in that line, I can wait in this one, too."" He waits half an hour in the limo line. 

After that he goes to buy the tickets to prom. Everyone else is buying tickets too, but he doesn't want them to run out so he has to wait over an hour in the ticket line. 

Finally he has everything he needs, so she asks the girl and she says yes. 

The night of prom they get in the limo and drive to the venue. The event isn't very well coordinated so traffic is atrocious, and they wait for what seems like forever in a stand-still traffic line. 

Finally, they get out of the limo and stand in line to get into the prom. It's a big school, so they wait for the better part of 45 minutes in the entry line. 

When they eventually make it inside, the boy and girl start dancing. They're both having a great time, but the girl gets thirsty so the boy offers to get her some punch.

He goes to the drink table and there's no punch line. 

Edit 1: wow, you scrolled to the bottom and read that there's no punch line? You're such a smart and special snowflake.

Edit 2: Yeah, I get it, this joke is a repost. I have never frequented r/jokes before, but I assume that reposts happen a lot. If all jokes were original content, this sub wouldn't be so active. ","A boy wants to ask a girl to prom, and he really likes her so he goes all out...",1643

He's wearing a dark hood obscuring much of his face, so he goes to investigate. He soon realizes that the hooded figure had no face at all. 

""Excuse me, sir,"" the man asked the hooded figure, ""do you mind taking off your hood for a moment?""

The hooded figure complies and pulls down the cloak, revealing a massive peach where his head should be. 

Taken aback, the man asks, ""why do you have a massive peach for a head?""

""It's a funny story, actually,"" the peach-headed man says, ""You see, I used to work at an antique shop, and one day, when dusting an old, Arabian lamp, a genie appeared and offered to grant me three wishes.""

""Wow,"" said the man, ""that is certainly incredible! What did you wish for?""

The peach-headed man responded: ""I was naturally very surprised by this development, but I wasn't about to allow a good thing go to waste. I immediately wished to become the richest man in the world, and immediately I received a notification on my phone alerting me that 10 trillion dollars had been deposited into my bank account.""

""Whoa! You certainly were lucky!"" Says the man. 

""Oh, no - but it doesn't end there. You see, I still had two more wishes, and I knew I had to make them count. After some consideration, I then wished to have the most beautiful woman in the world, both inside and out, to be my wife and share in this luxurious life I had just been granted."" The peach-headed man looked wistful as he spoke. 

""Did it work as expected?"" asked the man.   

Although lacking a face, the peach-headed person seemed to look up at the man incredulously. ""Certainly. Immediately, the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous woman entered the room with a ring on her finger. She was my new wife, you see. She seemed to hang off every word I said as if it were the most important thing in the world, and I immediately fell in love with her, too.""

""Jeez,"" says the man, ""and what did you ask for your third wish?""

The next weekend, they get in a boat and spend the day fishing. Unfortunately, neither of them has much luck, until all of a sudden, the priest feels a huge tug in his line. With some help from the fisherman, he reels in what must be a thirty pound largemouth bass.
Forgetting himself, the fisherman cries out, ""Woah, look at that big son-of-a-bitch!""
Appalled, the priest responds, ""Excuse me?""
The fisherman doesn't want to break ties with the priest, and he sees only one way out. ""Oh, no, Father, you misunderstand. This fish is called the son-of-a-bitch.""
""Oh, of course. I never would have known. Forgive me, my son.""
The fisherman cleans the gargantuan bass. They wrap up their day of fishing and head back to the priest's home, since they've decided to cook up the bass for dinner. The priest walks into the house with his cooler, and presents the fish to his cook.
""Look at this big son-of-a-bitch I caught!"" he says.
""Oh my God! It's the biggest I've ever seen! But are you sure you should be using that language, Father?"" the cook responds.
""Oh, don't worry. This fish's name is 'the son-of-a-bitch.' The fisherman told me so.""
""Oh, I understand. I'll start cooking it right away!""
As it happens, this priest is good personal friends with the Pope. By chance, the Pope happens to be in town, so he stops by to see his old friend. He is invited to stay for dinner.
The fisherman, the cook, the priest, and the Pope all are enjoying their dinner, when the Pope speaks up.
""Forgive me, friends, for I know that gluttony is a sin, but I simply can't help myself from eating this marvelous fish. I must know who is responsible.""
""Well, I caught the son-of-a-bitch,"" the priest says.

When he gets to his apartment on the 10th floor, he walks in to see his wife in bed, naked and sweaty. She was cheating on him.

He grabs the man by the neck and pushes his off the balcony, where he falls into some bushes. Surprisingly, he lives. Well, the man wants him dead, so he grabs the full outdoor refrigerator on the balcony and pushes it over the railing. In the process, it caught the man's shirt and he fell over, too. He died and went to heaven.

In Heaven, there's a long waiting line. St. Peter is interviewing people on their way in, saying they've reached capacity and they're only letting the people in who've had terrible last days.

He recaps about losing his job, his wife cheating on him, catching the man on the balcony, and his shirt snagging on the refrigerator.

Wow, St. Peter says, that is a terrible day. You can go ahead in.

The scientist prepares a scalpel, sewing kit, and measuring tape and begins his experiment; he says ""Jump, frog, jump!"" and as soon as the frog hears his voice, it jumps. The scientist measures the distance... the frog jumped four whole feet.  
""Hmmm..."" ponders the scientist, writing this down.

The scientist uses the scalpel to cut off one of the frog's front legs, and then sews the wound up. Then, eager to see what will happen, the scientist commands ""Jump, frog, jump!""  
Hearing the scientist's voice, the frog jumps. The scientist pulls out the measuring tape... the frog only made it three feet this time.  
""Hmm!"" the scientist says while stroking his beard.

The scientist removes the other front leg, stitches the wound closed, and resets the experiment.  
""Jump, frog, jump!"" he cries. The frog jumps forward, the scientist measures- only two feet of distance.  
""Hmmm."" the scientist ruminates.

Next to go is one of the frog's rear legs. Alas, sometimes science can be cruel.  
The scientist orders the test subject to ""Jump, frog, jump!"" and at the sound of his voice, the frog jumps- only 12 inches this time, and slightly off-center.  
""Hrm."" frowns the scientist, and records his data.

Finally, the last limb is taken off. The scientist places the legless amphibian back at his starting point and shouts ""Jump, frog, jump!""  
The frog just sits there, looking up at him with its little froggy eyes.

Perturbed, the scientist bellows ""JUMP, FROG, JUMP!"" to no avail. It just keeps looking up at him sadly with those little froggy eyes.

""AHA!"" cries the scientist, flush with the excitement of discovery.

“This is gonna be awesome, you’re gonna love it.”
“So is this some sort of a comedy club?”
“What? No. This is a joke club. I’m telling you Steve, these are some of the funniest people in the world. They know the best jokes. They’re all hilarious. You’re gonna die laughing.” Steve’s friend starts laughing at nothing in particular while Steve looks eager to get in.  
The door opens and an elderly gentleman greets them.  
“Hi Benjamin, this is Steve, guy I was telling you about.” Benjamin nods and let them in.  
The two friends, accompanied by Benjamin walk through a maze of empty hallways with peeled and cracked walls covered with faded paint, stains and spider webs. Benjamin opens a nondescript door to reveal a mid sized mostly empty room, in which a dozen people of various ages races and gender all sit in a circle, with several empty seats in between them. Steve’s friend waves to the seated people while Steve nods.  
Benjamin takes a seat in between a teenager with tattered jeans and a flannel shirt and skimpy dressed woman in her 40s. Steve and his friend sit in the only 2 empty seats that are next to each other.  
A black woman in her early 20s stands up and addresses the room. “22” she says loudly and clearly. Several people start laughing while the rest smile. Steve looks confused and she sits down.  
The teenager stands up and speaks “6.” everyone in the room (aside from Steve) start laughing. Benjamin nods his head in approval.  
Steve’s friend stands up himself, clears his throat and says “13!” Everyone in the room start roaring with laughter. A well dressed guy in his 30s start rolling on the floor laughing. A blonde woman stands up and starts running towards a door in the back end of the room.  
Steve looks puzzled, turns to his friend and whispers “I don’t understand. Why are you guys saying numbers? And why do everyone find it so funny?”  
Steve’s friend smile and responds “I told you, we know all the best jokes in here. We’ve assigned each one a number and instead of telling it we just say the number and everyone recalls the joke.”  
Steve notices a brunette has already stood up and is ready to call out her joke “134!” Again, everyone starts laughing.  
As she sits down, Steve decides to try this for himself and stands up. “56” he says. Silence throughout the room. “56!” Steve says more loudly. Everyone starts looking at him. “I don’t get it, why aren’t you laughing?” he asks.

The prostitutes were instructed to line up in a straight line on the sidewalk. Well, who should be walking in the neighborhood, but little old Grandma. The young girl became frantic.

Sure enough, Grandma noticed her young granddaughter and asked curiously, ""What are you lining up for dear?"" Not willing to let grandma in on her secret, the young girl said that some people were giving out free oranges and that she was lining up for some.

""Mmmm, sounds lovely,"" said Grandma, ""I think I'll have some myself,"" she continued as she made her way to the back of the line. A police officer made his way down the line, questioning all of the prostitutes. When he got to Grandma at the end of the line, he was bewildered. ""But, you're so old, how do you do it?""

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.

The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well.

He would decorate his room with posters of tractors and have little models of tractors scattered throughout the room. His spare time was either spent reading about tractors or listening to tractor sounds on his phone.
One day he was sitting on the field listening to these tractor sounds with his headphones on at full volume whilst reading about a new tractor being developed. Unfortunately he didn't hear the tractor approach him from behind and break his back in several different place as the tractor wheel covered his entire body. Luckily he was rushed off to the hospital shortly after the incident. 

My parents were given a choice. leave my brother paralysed or place him through an experimental procedure to restore his spine. They choose the latter and after 3 months of surgery with the greatest doctors my brother was able to walk again. The first thing he done when he came home was tear down all the tractor poster and smash all his models, he locked his bedroom door and began to release tears. He refused to eat, talk to anyone or even see anyone for roughly 4 weeks.

My parents and I heard of a party down the road they thought this would be a great opportunity to help my brother out. After a lot of persuasion and begging we finally convinced my brother to leave the room and come to the party with us. Once we arrived at the party some of the older kids were smoking and this was made noticeable from the mist in the room. My parent couldn't bear it and wanted to leave. However my brother spoke his first words since the incident ""Mum. Dad. Don't worry I will handle this"" he breathed in and all of a sudden the smoke disappeared. My mum asked how done that. My brother replied ""Mum. I'm an ex-tractor-fan""",My Brother,0

""Life is so unique and complex"", the first philosopher starts off, ""That even if it was not created by a god, it must have a definite purpose in this universe. If we don't know what that purpose is, that only means we have yet to find it, and life should still be considered sacred. Bartender, bring me a glass of your finest, most expensive liquor to represent the irreplaceable experience that is human life.""

""Unique? Oh please."" the second philosopher chimes in. ""Life is just a byproduct of chance, an illusion created by our inability to understand the complexity of our own biology. Under the hood, life is nothing but a bunch of chemical reactions, and consciousness is just some electricity running around between cells. There's nothing special about life, and certainly not human life. Bartender, give me the cheapest beer you have lying around to represent our mundane, pointless reality.""

""You guys are both thinking about this all wrong"" says the third philosopher. ""It doesn't matter if life has a set course, or came about by chance.

Bartender, serve me a mixed drink of your choice to represent that life is what you make of it.""

Each man takes his respective drink, makes a toast to their own ideal, and then promptly dies from the poison the bartender put in their glasses.",Three philosophers walk into a bar,2

post,5w1c0f,2qh72,jokes,false,1487983667,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5w1c0f/bj_stolen_from_a_friend/,self.jokes,,"You all know that I hardly ever post to Facebook but I HAVE to set something straight and get it off my chest. Sorry if this ends up being super long.
 
About 10 months ago I met a girl at work (I'll refer to her by her initials but some of you will know who she is anyways). BJ was absolutely beautiful. Straight out of a movie scene. I loved everything about her, from the way she would tuck her hair behind her ear to how she looked at me as if I was the only person in the world. 

I got up the courage to ask her out and she said yes. We ended up hitting it off. BJ and I kept it lowkey, not wanting to label it as anything too serious for our own reasons but we were both very interested in each other. BJ seemed nice at first but I always had this nagging feeling that she had an ulterior motive for dating me. 

She was always asking to go out, which was fine, but she'd pick the most expensive restaurants and activities and I'd end up footing the bill - she never offered. Naturally being a decent guy, I obliged because I thought she was worth it, plus she had mentioned that she'd always wanted to go to these places/do these things because her family could never afford to. I felt as if I was giving her an experience that meant a lot to her and being who she was, how could I possibly say no?
 
Her birthday happened to be coming up in May so I planned to take her on a surprise trip to NYC. On her birthday, I picked her up from her place with tulips (she really liked them) and we started the drive. I managed to keep it a secret for the first 60 miles but she's no idiot. When she figured it out, though, she was ecstatic.
 
When we arrived, I parked my car and she set up an Uber to take us to Fifth Avenue. I asked her what was there and she said it was a long street that was basically a shopping center. I kinda shrugged and just looked out the window. I'd never been to NYC before so I was taking it all in, all the different kinds of people, well-designed buildings, street performers... everything I'd expected and more. Except for the sounds. I hadn't been prepared for how loud the city was. Yelling, car honks, pigeon wings fluttering on the sidewalk, singing, music on the corner... All this noise wasn't annoying or disturbing. It completed the picture for me. The city was alive. 
 
After what felt like forever, the Uber guy said that we'd arrived. As we got out, Uber guy suggested we check out the Lego Store. Kind of a big kid myself, I thought that'd be cool. Problem with that plan was that he'd dropped us off in front of Michael Kors and BJ couldn't resist. She took my hand and led (more like dragged) me into the store. Being a watch guy, I figured I'd see what they had. Never been that impressed with Michael Kors watches but my other options were purses, high heels, and dresses so...
 
I'd barely gotten to the glass case where the watches were lined up when I noticed that BJ had gravitated towards a purse and picked it up, beaming. She bounced over to me with it in her hands. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she had set aside some money and wanted my opinion about it. Nope. She'd set her mind on getting it and as she opened up her big brown eyes at me and fixed her mouth in a pout, I recognized the ""buy-this-for-me-please-I-will-love-you-forever"" face. 

How expensive could this be? I thought. I flipped the tag around and immediately cringed.
 
""Oh, come on,"" she urged seeing my face, ""Please, I really like it.""
""I really wish I could, but I can't."" I could feel people's eyes on us, waiting to see how it'd unfold. Her face fell, a sudden switch from what it had looked like seconds earlier.
 
But I wasn't about to have her walk out of there with nothing. ""Are you sure there's no other one here you'd like?"" One by one, I flipped tags around and noticed some were actually in a price-range that didn't make me perspire and run for the door.
But she just shook her head.
 
""Let's just go,"" she said quietly, grabbing my arm. The lady at the door told us to have a nice day, but I doubted those words could have made anything nice about that day.
 
Our trip would have been fine if it wasn't so overcast with her disappointment. We walked around, had pizza at Joe's, went to Central Park and the Museum of Art. But the whole time I could tell that she was still upset. 
 
I figured that she was upset about more than a purse but I couldn't pinpoint it. On the way back I asked her about it. Told her I would have bought it if I could. She just shrugged and hit me with a, ""If you really loved me you would have,"" which I just thought was absurd because we were not in love and even if we were the depth of my pocket wouldn't be the measure of it.
 
And that was the end of that. I broke up with her as I dropped her off, knowing that there was no reconciling IT. She and I were very different. And I had discovered her ulterior motive.
 
Last week, I received a call from her. We hadn't talked since May. Without really easing into it, BJ said that on December 18th 2016 she'd GIVEN BIRTH TO A SON. Now she's threatening to take me to court to have a paternity test done. I told her that it was impossible that the boy is mine. She's been relentless, hitting up friends of mine, sending me harassing text messages daily, saying ""I know people I could send to your house, don't mess with me"". It's been CRAZY. All the while BJ says she still loves me. 
 
As I continue to deal with this I really have only one thing to say.
 
Look.

They then proceed to lead the husband to a back room that is poorly lit with an altar in the middle. Atop this alter is a simple mahogany box. After inquiring about the nature of this box, the husband finds out that it contains something called The Voodoo Dick. He opens the box to see a simple wooden dildo of standard length inside. Incredulous he asks the staff member how this simple object could possibly be the best, to which the staff member replies by pulling a flesh-light from behind their back and saying ""Voodoo dick, flesh-light"". To the husbands great surprise, the wooden device flies out of the box and begins thrusting the flesh-light of its own accord. Immediately intrigued the husband asks the staff member how much it costs, and is told that before purchase he will have to learn to control it. He quickly masters the only two commands saying voodoo dick and then the thing that the controller wants it to initiate intercourse with, and saying ""Voodoo dick, box"" in order to get it to stop. The husband pays the price of $2000 dollars without hesitation, and quickly heads home to show his wife. After informing her of the trip he will take he quickly shows her the device. He begins by saying ""Voodoo dick, my wife's vagina."" and the device begins to thrust her so vigorously that she passes out from ecstasy. He commands the device to go back to its box and gets some sleep before leaving early the next morning to get to the airport. When the wife awakes to find herself alone she quietly contemplates the nature of the strange device before getting ready for her own job. After a week and a half of putting it off, she decides to finally use the dildo that her husband acquired for her saying ""Voodoo dick, my vagina."" after an hour of pure pleasure, she realizes she doesn't know how to deactivate the device and begins to panic. She tries everything from calling her husband, who is on a plane and can't answer, to pulling it out which is futile for reasons she doesn't understand. She decides to drive to the hospital to see if medical professionals can alleviate the problem. What she didn't plan for was how hard it would be to drive straight on her way there, and promptly swerves all over city streets. When she is finally pulled over by a burly traffic policeman, she recounts those recent events to the man telling him that she's being fucked by a crazy voodoo dick, and this is where the officer says ""Voodoo dick my ass."".

""Sir, this dog has a blackbelt in karate and responds to voice commands!""

""Bull.  Do you think I'm a fool?""

Upon picking it up, a a cloud of smoke appears, and when it clears, to their amazement, there's a Genie!

The Genie says, ""As there are three of you, and it's unfair to only grant three wishes to the one who released me from this lamp, I shall grant each of you *one wish!*""

Steve Bannon says, ""America is going to hell in a hand basket. I wish to have all of the like-minded people who support the Alt-Right movement, who believe in racial purity and who are also staunch Republicans, to occupy the United States, and everybody who is not like us, to be immediately transported out!""

The Genie crosses his arms, closes his eyes and nods his head. *POOF!* Anyone who didn't conform to Bannon's view of ""the perfect American"" have disappeared from the U.S., and he too has vanished to his new utopia.

Donald Trump is AMAZED! He thinks for a moment, and says, ""Genie, I want you to build a wall... But not just any wall! I want it to be so tall that nobody can get in or out without my say so, impenetrable to all, and make it COMPLETELY SURROUND the United States to protect our perfect America!""

Again, the Genie crosses his arms, closes his eyes and nods his head. *POOF!* A huge, impenetrable wall suddenly materializes around the United States, and Trump disappears, into his perfect America.

Justin Trudeau looks around, and sees all of the new people standing around, flabbergasted and confused as to why they didn't fit into this new ""America"". He looks down, saddened by the sight and thinks carefully for a few minutes.

The Genie looks at him, eager to hear what the Canadian Prime Minister's wish will be.

Trudeau asks the Genie, ""Tell me, please. What has happened to our once-friendly neighbours to the south?""

The Genie responds solemnly, ""Well, Mr. Prime Minister, the United States is now filled with only those who blindly follow Mr. Trump and believe every word he says, and those who are alt-right, and who feel they are better than their fellow man. Everyone is surrounded by a wall that is 100 feet high, and made of impenetrable concrete... Sir, what is *your* wish?""

Local linear approximation is an extension of this concept, that basically says that if we zoom in on a part of a curve enough, it will appear to be flat.
