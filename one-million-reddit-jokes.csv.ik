If I lose I may be disappointed, but if I win I will join the legendary Gods of the Pantheon!

So he makes his way to Zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the Gods. Along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. Their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. The hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. A ways further and he sees Hercules, Chuck Norris, and even Atlas, who held up the entire world for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. The hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. If these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could I? But the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.

The hero had finally reached Zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. ""Welcome, great hero. If you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. Here is a jar of peanut butter. Please open the jar without using any hot water."" The hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.

""Very good"" says Zeus. ""For the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs."" As a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. He picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to Zeus's refrigerator.

""You give me hope, challenger! Perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. The feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! I have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. Retrieve the sword for me and I will present you the final challenge."" The hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. He notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. He presents the sword to Zeus.

""Hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. No mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as Hercules, Chuck Norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. Complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary Pantheon.

Zeus holds out his hand, and says ""Here is an uncracked pistachio. Open it.""",Zeus is offering a seat in his Pantheon for the first person to complete his trials of strength.,315

At home you watch TV,
but when you go out you take your MOBILE.

Sometimes you enjoy TV.
But most of the time, you play with your MOBILE.

TV is (as good as) free for life.
But for the MOBILE, if you don't pay, the services will be terminated.

TV is big, bulky and most of the time old.
But the MOBILE is cute, slim, curvy, replaceable and portable.

Operational costs for TV is often acceptable.
But for the MOBILE, it is often high and demanding.

TV has a remote.
But MOBILE doesn't.

Most importantly, MOBILE is a two-way communication (you talk and listen)
But with the TV, you MUST only listen (whether you want to or not)!!!!😝

Last but not least....!
Yet TV s are superior because
TVs don't have viruses,
but MOBILEs often do....!!!!😂


And mobiles can be easily hacked or stolen.

Because of its rarity, wood was prized, and this Chieftain happened to own a large, ornate chair made of wood that was his most priceless possession. 

Most everything else that they possessed- mats, shoes, even their homes were constructed of tightly woven straw.

Now in this community it was customary that if someone complimented something of yours, the polite thing to do was to give it to them. 

So the Chieftain really loved his chair, but he was set to host the chief of a neighboring tribe one  evening, and he was worried that the dude, ignorant of the custom, would compliment his chair, and then he'd have to give it to him or lose his people's respect.

So he took the chair and hid it in the layers of thatch that made up the roof, and the event went off successfully. He and the neighbor Chieftain had a nice dinner, and after dinner they kept on drinking and dancing.

The drank and danced and finally they danced so hard that they shook the whole building, and the wooden chair was knocked loose, and it fell down and hit our man on the head!

And that's why people who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

This would be a last minute flight as his schedule had suddenly freed up and he was now able to visit his elderly mother on her birthday. The lady at the counter smiled as she searched, but she had some bad news. There was one seat left on the only flight to Miami, but it was a low priority seat and he might be bumped if anyone else bought a ticket.  Figuring that this was better than nothing, Mr. Gay purchased the ticket and went to the gate.

A couple of hours later, Mr. Gay boarded the plane. What luck!  He had not been bumped from the flight and it looked like he was going to make it to Miami for his mother's birthday. He was seated on an aisle seat when he noticed that a gentleman in the row in front of him, sitting by the window, was sweating profusely and fidgeting in his seat.

""Are you alright, sir?"" Mr. Gay asked.

The nervous man replied, ""I have a terrible fear of flying, and I usually request an aisle seat, but because this airplane is so full, they sat me at the window and now I'm scared out of my wits.""

""We can't have that,"" Mr. Gay said with a smile,  ""I will gladly switch seats with you so that you can have a more comfortable flight.""

With a relieved sigh, the nervous man thanked him and switched seats with him.

A few more minutes went by as they waited for the plane to leave the terminal. The captain came on the PA system: ""Ladies and gentlemen, our apologies, but it seems that we have oversold this flight and our flight attendants will now be asking certain passengers to deplane at this time.""

Mr. Gay sank in his seat.  He knew that they would be coming for him.  Sure enough, the flight attendant came down the aisle, but walked right past him.   Mr. Gay had the sudden realization, that they were heading for his prior seat.

The flight attendant tapped the shoulder of the man that Mr. Gay had traded seats with.

""Sir,"" the flight attendant asked,  ""Are you Gay?""

The man in the seat seemed surprised, but then sheepishly nodded his head and said, ""Uh... yes,  I-I am, but...""

""I'm afraid you have to get off the plane, sir.""

Mr. Gay stood up. ""Wait!"" He said,  ""You don't understand!   I'M Gay!""

The drummer gets the microphone, the chord is played, and he sits there thinking. After some time, he asks ""Could you play it one more time?"". The pianist nods and plays the chord again.

Excited, the young man ran off to the costume shop, and bought himself a bishops costume.  He then made his way to the place the bus driver told him about, and just as he had described, there was the nun, walking alone down the darkened street.

""Anything to be of service to the Lord"" she said, and she followed him.

""I need a place to stay while here, and since I'm travelling incognito, It can't be known to the Mother Superior.""

""You can stay with me, your Holiness, I have my own bed chamber."" So she led him through a series of alleys, until she reached the door of her bed chamber.   They walk in, to see only the straw mattress on the floor.

""If it's in the service of the Lord, it isn't a sin."" he said, as he stripped off his clothes, and urged her to do the same.

""I am ashamed, let me turn down the lamp, you holiness""

At the funeral, the Priest noticed that when the women offered their sympathy, Frank would nod his head up and down. But when the men came up and spoke quietly to him, he would shake his head from side to side.

After the mourners left, the Priest approached Frank and asked, ""Why did you nod your head up and down to all the women and shook from side to side to all the men?""

Well, Frank replied, ""The women all said how nice she looked, and her dress was so pretty, so I agreed by nodding my head up and down.

Three small parties of all three Agencies meet on neutral ground, on the edge of an egyptian forest.

For the goal of the competition, they decided that each of their parties should catch a rabbit, using their espionage skills. The party that manages to catch the rabbit the quickest, wins.

First, the MI5 leaves for the forest. When they emerge eight hours later, they carry a live rabbit in a cage. ""We posted lookouts around the forest, and after spotting the rabbit, we shadowed it until it showed us his hideout, we then just placed the cage over the entrance and waited for the rabbit to fall in our trap. Neat and simple.""

Now, it's the turn of the CIA. They leave into the forest and emerge four hours later, holding a rabbit which seems to have been shot and badly beaten several times. ""We used satellite surveillance to aquire our target, but during the tracking with four inconspicious vans, the subject tried to escape, so we had to use drastic measures. Still counts."" Nobody objects.

Now, it was the turn of the KGB. The four agents disappear into the forest, and return after only an hour. But they are not carrying a rabbit, but hold a crocodile between two of the agents. The crocodile is badly bruised, has a limp and keeps his gaze to the ground. Absently, he mumbles ""I am a rabbit. My parents were both rabbits.""",Catching rabbits,231

post,94dv0y,2qh72,jokes,false,1533333550,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/94dv0y/so_why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,self.jokes,," So why did the chicken cross the road?    


SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!  


BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period.  


JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.  


HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road?  


GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.  


DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?  


BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.  


AL GORE: I invented the chicken.... and the road.  


JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.  


AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?  


DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.  


OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.  


ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.  


NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.  


PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.  


MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.  


DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.  


ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.  


GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.  


DONALD TRUMP: We should build a wall so the chicken can't cross the road.  


BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.  


ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.  


BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.  


ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?  


COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one? ","So, why did the chicken cross the road?",899

post,94dqis,2qh72,jokes,false,1533332597,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/94dqis/the_girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?""

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.""

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.""

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",The Girlfriend Joke,1297

The next morning a local news station began interviewing the locals in a nearby village about the fire. Everyone they asked agreed that it was a tragedy that Scotland had lost over a million bottles of whiskey. 

Finally the station’s reporter asked an old klansman in the village. 

The reporter said: 
“What do you think about the tragedy of Scotland losing one million bottles of Whiskey?”

Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her, ...don't reject the guy outright.

So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her. After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara.""

The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, ""No problem!! I have. I have.""

Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, ""I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.""

The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build. I build.""

Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.""

The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.""",The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sight-seeing tour with a very rich African king who was a very important client.,292

Along the way, the bus runs out of fuel and he has to get out with the rest of the passengers to push the bus to the nearest refueling station. 

Once he is at the bus depot, he hails an auto-riksha to take him to the airport. The traffic is so bad that the riksha runs out of fuel. Once again, he gets out to push the riksha to the nearest refueling station.  By now he is convinced that he is suffering from someone’s ‘evil eye’.

He eventually gets to the airport, checks in and takes his seat. The plane takes off and the feeling finally overwhelms him. So he grabs the arm of the nearest air-hostess and yells, ‘Tell that son of a bitch to double check the fuel because like hell I am going to step out to push this fucking plane.’

**The Petewish (Puh-tew-ish) Man**

Once, there was a little boy named Jack.

When Jack was in preschool, his teacher gathered all of her students in a circle and went around asking each of them what they wanted to be when they grew up.

“I want to be a fireman!” exclaimed Aiden.

“I want to be a doctor!” shouted Amanda.

“I want to be an astronaut!” Kristin bellowed. 

Around the circle they went, each child gleefully expressing their lofty dreams, until the teacher came upon little Jack. “I want to be a Petewish man,” he calmly stated.

“A what?” the teacher asked with a chuckle.

“A Petewish man.”

The teacher laughed it off as the product of an overactive childhood imagination, “okay Jack, I look forward to learning what that is!”

As Jack grew up, grade after grade the exchange repeated itself. 

“And what would you like to be when you grow up, Jack?” the teacher would ask.

“A Petewish man,” Jack would say with as much conviction as ever. 

With no explanation, the teacher would always say, “very well Jack” often having been warned by Jack’s previous instructors of his odd sense of humor. 

In high school, when Jack met with the career counselor, as all students did, to discuss his plans for the future, he was presented with a list of possible professions that would be suited to his aptitude scores. As he went down the list, among the many respectable prospective occupations, not once was his dream job, Petewish man, listed. 

“Thank you for your advice, Mr. Lackey,” Jack said, “but I am going to be a Petewish man.”

“Well Jack, like everybody else, I don’t know what that is, but I am sure we will find out some day, and I wish you the best.”

In college, Jack fell in love and was soon married to a fine woman named Jill. The prospect of a new family made Jack forget about his dream job for a time. The couple had two children and Jack became a successful engineer. But in the back of his mind, he always knew what his heart truly desired.

At 30, Jack decided to pursue his dreams and bought himself a fishing boat. One day, he invited all of his friends and family, and everybody who had ever questioned his desire of becoming a Petewish man, aboard his vessel and they set out into the ocean. 

When they reached a distance from shore where land was just barely visible on the horizon, Jack stopped the boat and stated to his anxious audience, “now I will show you all my greatest desire. I will become a Petewish man.”

With his wife and children, his friends, his parents, and even his preschool teacher and high school career counselor from long ago watching, Jack approached the edge of the boat and stared off into the calm waters. After a while, with the crowd waiting expectantly, he slowly reached into his jacket pocket and produced a smooth, nearly perfectly rounded stone. After another pause, he reached his arm back and, with all of his might, launched the stone as far as he could from the boat. And as the stone finally struck the water, it made the sound, *Petewish*!

""I don't know what to do,""  says the Devil. ""You're on my list but I have no room for you.
 But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have  to take their place.  I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.”
 
Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.
 
The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing  empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.
 
""No!"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""
 
The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a  room full of rocks. All he did was swing  that hammer, time after time after time.
 
""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented  Trump.
 
The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump  saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and  his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can  handle this.""

A confession in a Facebook page read :

""My sister is a hottie.""

Wow... okay, I wasn't sure if I was ever going to tell anyone about this, but it's late and I am sleep deprived so I guess I'll write it now and regret it in the morning. 

First of all - just for some background : My mom died right when I was born, She was really really hot, but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever... I actually grew up with my dad's family because my dad had all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kinda messed up!

Anyway, growing up, I feel like there was always a lot of distance between my sister and I. When I was about 17 or 18, I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me but I thought she was so beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. My dad's family with whom I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it.

So, I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having trouble with the law, and was actually in custody when I left home. My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, It's still pretty messed up - but I think she had feelings for me too, she actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly!

After we left, we all went to crash with my sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my sister and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister-  I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. 

Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I am not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time!

My friend and my sister never hooked up - I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery, my sister came to see me, and out of the blue she started giving me this awesome slow passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly, nothing came of it. We spent some time apart and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way.  It was actually going really well for a long time and I thought I was totally over her. But I have to say, Like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh...

A little while later, she actually wound up with my friend from before. I can't say I was surprised.

But even after she was shackling up with my friend, there was this one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed  the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him...

Townfolk watch in horror when the stranger then removes his, now rather shit covered finger and proceeds to wipe his mouth from corner to corner with that finger.  Then hthe stranger disappeared into the saloon through the swinging double doors.

One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no actual address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about..

The letter read: Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension payment. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with, have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me? Sincerely, Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.

Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.

It read: Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it might have been those bastards at the post office.

The bike is a little older but it is in perfect condition, no scrapes or dents, the chrome pieces shine like new, and the leather seat looks like it hasn’t aged a day. He is stoked!! He tells the guy that he will buy the motorcycle under one condition, “Tell me how you keep it so nice and clean” he says. To which the gentleman agrees and pulls out a can of Vaseline, then proceeds to tell him “it sounds weird but every time it looks like it is about to rain I rub this Vaseline over the entire bike.” The guy buying the bike tells him “that does sound weird but if it works then I’ll do it!” So the guy buys the bike and rides it and puts Vaseline on it before rains, to his surprise it works. 

A few months go by and the guy is invited to meet his girlfriends parents since their relationship is getting more serious. So they ride the bike over to the parents for supper and before they go in the girlfriend stops him and says “honey, my family is a little on the crazy side, the first person to talk at dinner has to do the dishes.” “That does sound crazy but I’m not doing any fucking dishes,” he responds. So once they get in everyone sits down and just like his girlfriend said, no one says a damn word. So a little after halfway through dinner, still nothing, no one has said a word or made a sound. He’s thinking to himself “I’m not doing any dishes, I bet I can get them to talk.” So he starts making out with his girlfriend, still nothing, her parents didn’t bat an eye and they just kept eating. He starts groping her wondering how far he has to take it before someone speaks up, still no one says a word. So he starts fucking her right there at the dinner table, really knocking it out! STILL NOTHING! No one says a thing, so after a couple minutes he looks at the mom who is also very beautiful and looking good and starts making out with her and groping her, still nothing! “Unbelievable” he thinks! So he starts fucking the mom right there at the dinner table. His girlfriend and her dad act as though nothing is happening even though they obviously see everything, they are silent... After several minutes of fucking the mom he looks outside and sees that it looks like it might rain so he grabs his can of Vaseline and without missing a beet the dad stands up and screams “ALRIGHT ALRIGHT I’LL DO THE DISHES!”",Buying a motorcycle...,9

post,944s9b,2qh72,jokes,false,1533255507,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/944s9b/the_physics_student/,self.jokes,,"Some time ago, I received a call from a colleague who asked if I would be the referee on the grading of an
examination question. He was about to give a student a zero for her answer to a physics question, while the student
claimed she should be given a perfect score and would, if the system were not set up against the student. The
instructor and the student agreed to submit this to an impartial arbiter, and I was selected.

I went to my colleague’s office, and read the examination question: “Show how it is possible to determine the height
of a tall building with the aid of a barometer.”
The student had answered, “Take the barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower the
barometer to the street, and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is equal to the
height of the building.”

I pointed out that the student really had a strong case for full credit, since she had answered the question completely
and correctly. On the other hand, if full credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade for the student in her
physics course. A high grade is supposed to certify competence in physics, but the answer did not confirm this. I
suggested that the student have another try at answering the question. I was not surprised that my colleague agreed,
but I was surprised that the student did.

I gave the student six minutes to answer the question, with the warning that her answer should show some
knowledge of physics. At the end of five minutes, she had not written anything. I asked if she wished to give up, but
she said no. She had many answers to this problem; she was just thinking of the best one. I excused myself for
interrupting her and asked her to please go on. In the next minute, she dashed off her answer which read: “Take the
barometer to the top of the tall building and lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a
stopwatch. Then, using the formula S = 1/2 at2, calculate the height of the building.”

At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded, and I gave the student almost full credit.
On leaving my colleague’s office, I recalled that the student had said she had other answers to the problem, so I
asked her what they were. “Oh yes,” said the student. “there are many ways of getting the height of a tall building
with the aid of a barometer. For example, you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height
of the barometer, the length of its shadow, and the length of the shadow of the building, and by the use of a simple
proportion, determine the height of the building.”

“Fine,” I said. “And the others?”

“Yes,” said the student. “Here is a very basic method of measurement that you will like. In this method, you take the
barometer and begin to walk up the stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the barometer along the
wall. You then count the number of marks, and this will give you the height of the building in barometer units. A very
direct method.

“Of course, if you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a
pendulum, and determine the value of ‘g’ at the street level and at the top of the building. From the difference
between the two values of ‘g,’ the height of the building can, in principle, be calculated.”

Finally, she concluded, there are many other ways of solving the problem. “Probably the best,” she said, “is to take
the barometer to the basement and knock on the superintendent’s door. When he answers, you speak to him as
follows: “Mr. Superintendent, here I have a fine barometer. If you will tell me the height of this building, I will give you
this barometer.”",The Physics Student,87

After years of this same routine, the owner of the store was overcome with a morbid curiosity.  The next time March 22 came around, he asked the old woman, “Look, I don’t mean to pry, but why do this?”  She told him, with a grim look on her face and a quiet melancholy in her voice, “March 23 was the day my husband was born”.  The owner responded with a gentle smile, “Oh. I’m so sorry”.  Looking back up the owner with an appreciative glance she said, “Thanks.

When they reached the pearly gates of heaven, they were greeted by Saint Peter himself.

He greeted them and explained, “Before I let you pass into Heaven, I must ask if any of you have ever strayed from the path, and used a part of your body in a sexual way? As you know, you must be pure to cross into Heaven!”

They all shook their heads at him, as if even the suggestion of this was absurd.

He continued, “If you have, you must wash the unholy part of your body at this font, so as to cleanse it, otherwise you shall not pass into Heaven and will go straight down to Hell.” 

Saint Peter pointed to a golden font, which stood proudly in front of the gates of Heaven.

Again, the nuns all shook their heads at this preposterous suggestion.

“Very well then ladies, if you would be so kind as to join the queue, we will have you enter into Gods kingdom shortly.” He turned and headed down to the gates to continue his duty of administering people into Heaven.

And so the three nuns joined the back of the queue. 

As they were getting closer to the gates, the first nun slyly dipped her hand into the font and quickly washed it with the holy water.

She reached the front of the queue and warily stepped over the threshold.

“Lo and behold, you are pure!” Cried Saint Peter, and the first nun gleamed with joy as she was accepted into heaven.

Suddenly, the third nun pushed in front of the second nun and started gargling the holy water from the font!

“Oh my goodness! What are you doing?” Cried Saint Peter.

post,941xr7,2qh72,jokes,false,1533235044,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/941xr7/official_rules_for_indoor_golf/,self.jokes,,"(an oldie, but a goodie)

1.  Each player will furnish his own equipment for play; normally, one club and two balls.

2.  Course to be played must be approved by the owner of the hole.

3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and
keep the balls out of the hole.

4.  Course owners are permitted to check the stiffness of the shaft before play begins.

5.  For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.


6.  Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length or girth of the club to avoid damage to the hole.

7.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until course owner is satisfied. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.

8.  It is usually considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arriving at the course. The experienced player will normally admire the entire course with special attention paid to well formed bunkers.

9.  Players are cautioned not to mention any other course that they have played, or currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.

10.  Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, especially on a different course being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to get irate
if they find someone else playing what they considered their own private course.

11.  Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some owners may be embarrassed if their course is temporarily under repair, and the player is advised to use tact in this determination. More advanced players will find alternative means to play when this is the case.

12.  It is considered the outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same course hole several times in one match.

13.  Responsible indoor golfers always use a golf bag.

14.  Course owners shall be the sole judge of who is the best player.

15.  Players are not permitted to tee off on the back nine without the express permission of the course owner. ",Official Rules for Indoor Golf,12

When he walks in. He sees a fishbowl full of $100 bills on the bar with a note that says “Ask bartender about contest”. 

So the guy sits down, orders a beer, and motions towards the fishbowl. He asks the bartender, “So what’s up with the contest?”

The bartender says, “Well, it costs $100 to enter and there are 3 challenges. If you complete them all, you get all of the money in the pot. That fishbowl is just this month’s entries. In total there’s $97,500 in the pot.”

So the guy is curious and asks what the challenges are. The bartender replies, “First, you see that bald guy covered in tattoos at the end of the bar? That’s my security. He used to be marine recon, then when he got out, he was a pit fighter who never lost a fight. You knock him out with one punch and that’s challenge #1.”

The bartender continues, “Out back is my pet Rottweiler. He’s got an abcessed tooth and no vet in the city will even consider trying to remove it because he’s so mean. You get that tooth out and you’ve finished challenge #2.”

“For the last challenge, upstairs is Loose Lily. She’s an 80 year old prostitute with the loosest vagina this side of the Rockies. No man has been found who can please her with his penis. You bring her to orgasm and that’s challenge #3.”

So the guy is a bit overwhelmed by this and decides he is not up for the attempt. He finished his beer, has another, then heads home. 

A couple of weeks go by, and the guy is back in the bar celebrating his birthday. Everybody is buying him drinks and he finds himself drunker this he’s ever been. That’s when he sees the fishbowl and decides tonight is the night for him to win that money. 

He throws $100 at the bartender and begins to stagger towards the bouncer. Just Before he reaches him, he trips on a barstool and falls forward. He flails out, and his right fist just happens to catch the bouncer right in his temple. The bouncer goes down in a heap. 

The man picks himself up and staggers towards the door leading into the alley where the dog waits. All of the bar patrons realize what’s going on, so it’s dead silent. As the man enters the alley, the patrons hear growls, barking, and what sounds like a knock down, drag out brawl between man and dog. After a couple of minutes, they hear one last yelp, a few dog whimpers, then silence. 

Everybody is shocked. Nobody knows what to say as the drunk guy walks back into the bar. He staggers in, looks around, and yells, “Ok, now where’s the whore with the bad tooth?”",A man moves to a new neighborhood...,21

The clerk hits a key on the register and tells the couple that the cost of the meal is $4.98.

The old man reaches into his pockets and pulls out a handful of coins. Slowly and carefully, without a penny to spare, he counts out the exact amount and hands it to the cashier.

A young man standing behind the couple watches this. As the clerk assembles the couple’s order, he leans forward and says, “I’d be honored to buy you another burger and fries.”

The old man turns to the young man and says, “Thank you, but my wife and I share everything.”

The old man carries the tray of food to a table and they sit. Carefully, he cuts the burger in half, divides the fries into two equal portions, and passes half of the food to the woman. He sets the decaf in the center of the table so they can both reach it. Then he begins to eat.

A few minutes later, the young man sits down at the table next to them. As he gobbles down his food, he notices that, while the elderly man eats, the woman is quietly sipping decaf. When he looks at her food, he sees that she hasn’t eaten a single bite. Again, he leans toward the couple and says, “I really would be honored to buy you another meal.'”

The old man says, “No, thank you. We share everything,” and calmly resumes eating.

Jimmy's mum gives him a kiss and waits outside their home for his bus to arrive. Jimmy's mum reminds Jimmy to just wave at the bus driver a smile saying, ""Hey Mr. Bus Driver! Stop!"". Jimmy nods, and patiently waits for the bus to come.

Shortly thereafter, the bus comes down the street toward them. Jimmy, remembering his mother's advice calls out ""Mr. Bus Dwyver Stoooop!"". But the bus goes right on by.

The same thing happened the next day, and the next. Jimmy's mother then suggests that perhaps the bus driver did not see or hear Jimmy, and to perhaps stand on the street to call out the next day.

Jimmy dutifully stands in the street as the bus comes toward him and yells ""STOP MR BUS DWYVER STOP!"". The bus runs Jimmy over and careens down the road leaving Jimmy's mother speechless. 

When interviewed by the police, the most common question is ""why??""

The bus driver, who seems particularly angry by the whole scenario, loudly responds ""I thwort he wuss makings fun owv meeee!""
