The driver of the Yugo rolls down his window and shouts to the driver of the Rolls, ""Hey, buddy, that's a nice car. You got a phone in your Rolls? I've got one in my Yugo!""

The driver of Rolls looks over and says simply, ""Yes I have a phone.  

""The driver of the Yugo says, ""Cool! Hey, you got a fridge in there too? I've got a fridge in the back seat of my Yugo!""

The driver of the Rolls, looking annoyed, says, ""Yes, I have a refrigerator.""

The driver of the Yugo says, ""That's great, man! Hey, you got a TV in there, too? You know, I got a TV in the back seat of my Yugo!""

The driver of the Rolls, looking very annoyed by now, says, ""Of course I have a television. A Rolls-Royce is the finest luxury car in the world!""

The driver of the Yugo says, ""Very cool car! Hey, you got a bed in there, too? I got a bed in the back of my Yugo!""

Upset that he did not have a bed, the driver of the Rolls-Royce sped away, and went straight to the dealer, where he promptly ordered that a bed be installed in the back of the Rolls. The next morning, the driver of the Rolls picked up the car, and the bed looked superb, complete with silk sheets and brass trim. It was clearly a bed fit for a Rolls Royce.  

So the driver of the Rolls begins searching for the Yugo, and he drove all day. Finally, late at night, he finds the Yugo parked, with all the windows fogged up from the inside. The driver of the Rolls got out and knocked on the Yugo. When there wasn't any answer, he knocked and knocked, and eventually the owner stuck his head out, soaking wet.

""I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce,"" the driver of the Rolls stated arrogantly!

As the pilot walked the first block, he noticed a rat following him. At the next block two more joined the first. Another block and ten were following him. The pilot started to run with growing concern, but more and more rats began to chase the pilot carrying the large bronze rat. Soon there were thousands of rats chasing the pilot as he ran down the hill towards the waterfront.  The pilot, thinking quickly, leapt out over the water and grabbed onto a hook from a crane that happened to be there.  Thousands and thousands of rats jumped after him but fell to their death and drowned in the water.  The pilot managed to leap back down to land with the bronze rat and ran back to the shop where he had purchased it.  As he walked back in, the shopkeeper looked at him as a sly grin came to his face.
""Ahh, I see you back for ancient secret of bronze rat.""

Then his memory shuts out, and after a few hours, he wakes up with a note saying:

""My son, I have a few notes about your mass:

- You don't put a few drops of wine into vodka, but a few drops of vodka into wine,

- You greet the churchgoers with ""In the name of the Father"", not ""Wazzup?""

- There were 10 Commandments, not 12,

- There were 12 Apostles, not 10,

- The ""big T"" is a cross,

- The person on the cross is Jesus Christ, not Che Guevara,

- Jesus was a carpenter, not a ""fucking hobo"",

- Judas wasn't a ""motherfucking bastard"", but a sinner,

- I support the idea of making the churchgoers clap their hands, but doing the Macarena is a bit too much,

- The Communion is for the churchgoers, not a lunch for the priest,

- You say ""Go in peace"", not ""Fuck off"" at the end of the mass,

- The ""transhomofaggot in a dress"" was me, your bishop.

Godspeed."".",A note to a priest (Long).,3

In one of the classes, they're in the middle of a discussion about words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Trump if he'd like to lead the discussion of the word ""tragedy.""

He agrees to do so and asks the class for an example of a tragedy.

One little boy stands up and says, ""If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy.""

""No,"" says Trump, ""That would be an accident.""

Next a little girl raises her hand and says, ""If a school bus carrying forty children went off a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""

""No, I'm afraid not,"" says Trump. ""That's what we would call a great loss.""

The room goes silent for a while as no other children volunteer.

Trump looks around the room and says a little testily, ""Isn't there anyone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?""

At last, a little boy at the back of the class raises his hand and says, ""If a private jet carrying you, Mr Trump, was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" shouts Mr Trump, ""That's exactly right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates. 

You may visit the store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch: you may choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! 

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband... 

On each floor the signs on the doors read: 

Floor 1 - These men have jobs. 

Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids. 

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking. ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead good looking and help with the housework. ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 3,261,496,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious-looking platter being served at the next table.

It looked good.

It smelled good.

He asked the waiter, ""What is that you just served?""

The waiter replied, ""Ah senor, you have excellent taste! Those are bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A delicacy!""

The visitor, though momentarily daunted, said, ""What the heck, I'm on holiday down here! Bring me an order!""

The waiter replied, ""I am so sorry senor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy!""

The next morning, the man returned, placed his order, and then that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.

After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, ""These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday!""

The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, ""Si, Senor. Sometimes the bull he wins.""

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.

post,6hy0fq,2qh72,jokes,false,1497762157,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6hy0fq/prom_night/,self.jokes,,"Jimmy and Jessica are both seniors in high school, and prom is approaching. They've been dating for two years, and Jimmy wants to make sure that everything goes perfectly for Jessica; he really wants the night to be special and wants to pull out all the stops. Being that prom is only a month away, he decides to get started early. 

The first step in his master plan is to rent a limo. So Jimmy heads to the local limo store and inquires about the most luxurious stretch limo they have to offer. He had a lot of money saved from his summer job, so he knew he could splurge a little for this special night. He speaks to the salesperson for a bit and decides to rent a white stretch limo with strip lighting and leather interior, and he even gets the deluxe package that includes complimentary drinks and snacks inside. He goes to check out and realizes that every other boy in school had the same idea of planning ahead! The line to the counter stretches all the way to the back of the store! So Jimmy waits, and he waits, and he waits.... and finally, he makes it to the counter and reserves the limo. 

A week later, he decides to go try on a few different tuxedos. He remembers that Jessica's dress is a beautiful shade of cerulean blue. So he approaches a clerk and asks for help, and together they find a beautiful silver tux with blue stitching and blue silk lining. He finds a tie, nearly the exact shade of blue as Jessica's dress! He spends some time getting his measurements done and approaches the counter. Again, he's greeted by a very long line! A little annoyed, he decides it's worth waiting for this perfect tuxedo. So he waits, and he waits, and he waits, and finally he makes it to the counter and pays for the tuxedo. 

Prom is now one night away. 

Jimmy has decided to wait until now to buy Jessica a beautiful bouquet of flowers because he wants them to be as freshly cut as possible. He goes to the local flower store and asks the florist for help. Jessica's favorite flower is a lily, but unfortunately they're not in season. So he begs the shop owner, and she slips into the back of the store for a moment and returns with a beautiful bouquet of white lillies! She explains that because of the scarcity, they'll be a little more expensive than the other arrangements. Jimmy decides that it'll be fine and that Jessica is worth the extra few dollars. The shop owner wraps the lillies in a beautiful paper bag and hands them to Jimmy and agrees to meet him at the register. Again, Jimmy approaches the register to find an extremely long line. This is expected, because prom is the very next day after all, and everyone wants fresh flowers and corsages! 
So he waits in the line... and he waits, and he waits.... and he waits. Finally, he reaches the counter and makes his purchase. 

Jimmy is so pleased with his plans and how well they've worked out, and he's very excited to share his gifts with Jessica to give her the most memorable senior prom that any high school girl could ever hope for. 

The day of prom arrives. 

Jimmy picks up the limo and shows up at Jessica's house with flowers in hand. As she steps out of the house and makes her way towards the limo, Jimmy admires how stunning she is in her beautiful blue dress. Jessica is so excited to see all the effort he put into everything, she hugs him and compliments his tuxedo. She caresses the lillies and inhales their sweet smell. Everything is perfect. They climb in the limo and head to the dance. 

The first dance is spectacular and Jimmy and Jessica are having a great time. The second song played is one of their favorites, and the third song was one that played on their first date at the bowling alley. Everything is perfect.

Jimmy spins his girlfriend around on the dance floor and pulls her close. 

""You are the most georgeous girl at the dance. Are you having a good time, my love?"" He asks her.

""Yes! Everything is perfect! I can't believe you did all of this for me!"" Jessica is glowing.

Jimmy smiles and asks, ""Is there anything I can give you in this moment to make it even better?""

Jessica thinks for a moment and realizes she is parched from all the dancing they've been doing. 

""Well, I am pretty thirsty. I could use something to drink.""

Jimmy realizes he is thirsty too and heads off to get something to quench their thirsts. He spots the refreshment table at the end of the dance floor and makes his way over to the array of bowls of various red juices, and he realizes, to his great relief, that there is no punch line.",Prom Night,4

A man yells, ""I’ll take that bet."" and leads the horse into the men’s room.

After a couple seconds, a loud braying laugh is heard from behind the door. The farmer screams to the man, ""OK, I’ll give you $2,000 if you can make my horse cry.""

The man shouts, ""You’re on!""

After a few more seconds, the man exits with the horse trudging behind him with tears streaming down his long snout. Flabbergasted, the farmer asks, ""How did you do it?""

The man replies, ""I said that my dick was bigger than his and he laughed. Then I showed it to him.""

Having heard enough, I got up out of my seat at the bar area and walked over to the crying horse. Turning, I glared at the farmer, ""I hope your happy with yourself.""

""What?"" The farmer asked, actually confused by my tone of voice.

""How could you go and make such a poor creature cry?"" I asked, stepping close to the horse and petting his snout to wipe his tears away.

""So they can harvest my tears."" The horse suddenly spoke in a pathetic voice.

""WHAT?"" I did a double take, This horse could actually TALK?

""My name is Stardust and I'm no ordinary horse. I'm actually a unicorn. I'm just taking the form of a horse so no one knows I'm a unicorn. Unfortunately, the farmer found out when I shed a tear onto his injured hand and it sealed up just like magic."" The horse explained to me, ""So here I am, a slave to the farmer. I'm forced to cry so he can have an endless supply of healing tears and get rich off of me. It sounds altruistic but they always make fun of my penis size which I'm super sensitive about.""

""My name is Kurt."" I introduced myself, petting Stardust on his cheek, ""And I'm here to liberate you.""

""You can't just-"" The farmer started by I interrupted him.

""I don't think so. You're psychologically fucked this creature hard enough. Can't you see he's miserable?""

""So very, very miserable."" Stardust replied as a new batch of glimmering tears rolled down his snout.

I hugged the horse, ""You see?""

""Kurt."" Stardust sniffled, ""I uh......know it's kind of a weird request but I'd like you to lick my tears away.""

""I beg your pardon?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Drinking my tears also grants wishes."" Stardust replied as a large tear formed on the rim of his nostril as he shyly stared at the floor, ""Please Kurt, wish me away to freedom.""

""If you insist."" I shrugged. Leaning in close, I gently licked the tear off of Stardust's snout with my tongue and instantly I felt a sensation of warmth inside of me.

""Now close your eyes and wish for me to be free."" Stardust said as he nuzzled my cheek.

I did just that and in a flash of bright light, the horse transformed into a beautiful and elegant unicorn. ""NOOOOOOO!"" The farmer screamed.

""Well I'll be."" The man gasped at the sight.

""Thank you, Kurt. You've finally freed me from my joke prison. Shall we ride off into the sunset together?""

""All right."" I replied nonchalantly, hopping onto Stardust's back. Instantly, Stardust farted, a rainbow shooting out of his ass causing him to travel at the speed of light. Who knew I'd make friends with a unicorn? Fate works in mysterious ways. The end. ",Old joke with a new twist,0

The man takes the doctor's advice and heads into the forest. There was a lake there and out of nowhere a frog jumps out and says, ""Halt, who goes there?"" 

The man, dumbfounded that there is an actual talking frog, is barely able to speak but manages to softly say, ""Hello, I was was walking in the forest to find you. I must ask you one question: Will you kiss me?""

The frog says, ""no"" and hops away.

The man checks his pants and he sees that his penis has shrunk 5 inches just like the doctor said. He decides to come back tomorrow to shrink it some more. The next day the frog appears in the same spot and goes, ""Oh it's you again. What do you want?""

The man tells him, ""I was a bit saddened about your rejection yesterday and was wondering if you thought it over. Would you like to have a kiss from me?""

The frog says yet again, ""no"" and hops off again. The man checks his pants and sees his penis has shrunk by another 5 inches.

He had no friends, no family, and worked the worst job. The only thing he ever looked forward to was seeing his beautiful neighbor on his way home from work, Jenny. 

One day after coming home from work he say a strange lamp in his front yard. He brought it inside and began to clean it off with a towel and soap. As he rubbed the lamp, a small fairy squeezed its way out. 

Benny was shocked as the fairy began to speak to him. ""Hi Benny! Thanks for rescuing me!"" Benny's eyes twitched as he examined the sprite. ""As reward for your noble deed, I will grant one wish!"" The fairy said. 

Benny cleared his throat. With a tear in his eye he proclaimed ""I... I wish to be happy!"" The fairy nodded. ""Your wish will be granted the next time you awake. But beware, there is one rule. You must never shave your beard or any hair on your face. If you do shave, you will spend eternity in a tiny pot! Do we have a deal?"" Benny nodded his head and said with excitement ""Yes of course!"" He reached out his finger to shake the fairy's small hand. 

The fairy disappeared in an instant. Benny was eager to sleep, so he threw on his pajamas and went to sleep. 

The next morning, he noticed he had a huge beard that covered his chin. But that wasn't the only difference. He was also overjoyed with life. He felt joy and happiness at every moment in his day, even through his terrible job which he had previously hated. 

On his way home, Benny saw Jenny. Benny worked up the courage to speak to hear, and they became closest of friends because of his bright new outlook on life. 

By the end of the week, Benny and Jenny had become very intimate. However, Jenny was upset. ""Listen.. I like you so much, but I need you to shave the beard. I just had a bad breakup with a guy who had a beard like yours.. I just can't be comfortable with you while you have it."" Benny nodded his head and went straight into the bathroom to shave it off. 

Benny lathered his face with cream. He took a razor off of his shelf and stared at his beard in the mirror. He hesitated as he remembered what the fairy told him. He shook his head and told himself ""There's no way she would do that to me. She must have been joking!""  

He shaved off his beard and began to leave the bathroom. He saw the fairy on the floor. She was enraged at him. ""I TOLD YOU TO NEVER SHAVE YOUR BEARD!!"" she screamed. At that moment, Benny was encased in a large urn, in which he would stay until the day he died.

Lenin turns to the men and says, ""Comrades, I know exactly what we should do! We will go to a nearby village and inspire the Proletariat workers to build a path the rest of the way to Moscow! That will get us to the rally in time!""

Stalin chuckled darkly and shook his head. ""Comrade, you are too idealistic. That will never work! What we must do is go to the village and execute every tenth worker. This will frighten them to work as fast as possible building the tracks. Surely THIS is the best way to get to the rally!"" 

Brezhnev turned to the men and scoffed. ""That will not work either! We have neither the supply nor the manpower. It is obvious what we should do. We will take the tracks from behind the train, and put them in front of the train. Then, we will move the train forward to Moscow, one track link at a time! This will be the most efficient way to reach Moscow.""

Gorbachev looked at the other leaders and shook his head slowly. ""My friends,"" he said, ""you are all wrong.""

When they arrive home, the boy's mother is plucking a Chicken. She accidentally burns her finger in the boiling water and yells ""FUCK!""


The son overhears this and asks, ""mummy what does fuck mean?""



The mother scrambles for an answer and replies ""Its just another word for pluck!""



Later that evening, the father is having a shave and accidentally cuts himself and yells ""BOLLOCKS!"" 


The son, in predictable fashion, asks ""Daddy what does bollocks mean?"" 


The dad is frustrated at himself by now for swearing so much, and replies ""It's another word for face""



Shortly after this, there is a knock on the door.



The son opens it to see two policemen, and proudly says:



""Hello bastards! Come in, don't forget to wipe your feet on the shit!, my dad's upstairs shaving his bollocks and my mum's in the other room fucking a chicken!""",Father and his 5 year old Son are walking on their farm together...,117

Both of her parents, liberal Democrats, were standing there, so I asked her, 'If you were to be the President, what's the first thing you would do?' She replied, 'I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.'

'Wow - what a worthy goal.' I told her, 'You don't have to wait until you're President to do that.

You can come over to my house and mow the grass, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you $50. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food or a new house.'

She thought that over for a few seconds, 'cause she's only 6.

""OHMYGOD! I'm on my way!""

He is speeding his way to the hospital, and he can't stop himself from thinking the worst.
He parks in the lot, runs inside, and finds the front desk. 

""Hello! Can anyone help me?! I'm looking for Dr. Warner!""

A nurse hears him and says, ""You must be Mr. Sanders. Follow me""
As she takes him down a couple hallways to meet with Dr. Warner, his mind is going into overdrive. He thinks to himself, ""Everything will be ok, everything will be ok.""

They find Dr. Warner and the nurse says, ""Dr. Warner, this is M---""
""YEAYEAYEA I'm Mr. Sanders, what is going on with my wife?!!""

The Dr. takes Steve to a couch in the hallway and they sit down.

""Well, Steve, I'm going to be up front with you, it doesn't look good. It looks like she will be paralyzed from the neck down for the rest of her life, but we have many pamphlets and materials to help you care for her once she is able to leave the hospital. We also have a very effective support group that meets once a week if you're interested.""

As Steve is listening to all this, he is just freaking out, thinking about the prognosis, and what it means for the REST OF HIS LIFE.
He starts talking to himself out loud without realizing, ""Wow, I never thought I would be in this position--we have only been married for three and a half years--do I really love this woman enough to put forth this kind of effort?--am I going to have to hire a full-time caregiver--or maybe quit my job and stay at home to do it myself?--I don't want to change adult diapers for years--I don't want to feed anyone food through a straw or whatever for years--""

""Then wash your left hand in holy water"", sentences the old man.
She leaves and another nun enters the confessional.

""What sins do you have to confess?"", the priest asks again.
""I slept with that new priest, he is so handsome I could not resist"".
The priest starts being a bit jealous of his young colleague's conquests and replies: ""This is bad! What did you do with him?"", he asks.
The nun answers ""I gave him a handjob with my right hand"".
""Then wash your right hand in holy water"".
As the nun exits the confessional the priest hears a lot of noise and he sees that the other nuns are arguing near the stoup.

So he gets out and asks ""What is this noise? Why are you arguing?"", and one of the nuns screams ""I'm sorry, father, but I want to wash my mouth before she washes her ass!""",A priest is confessing some nuns...,10

""I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!""


The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""","One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference",390

Having arrived at the Gates of
Heaven, he meets a man with a beard. 

""Are you Mohammed?"" he asks. 

""No, my son. I am Peter. Mohammed is higher up."" And he points to a ladder that rises into the clouds. 

Delighted that Mohammed should be higher than Peter, he climbs the ladder in great strides, climbs through the clouds, coming to a room where he meets another bearded man. 

He asks again, ""Are you Mohammed?"" 

""No, I am Moses. Mohammed is higher still."" 

Exhausted, but with a heart full of joy he continues to climb the ladder and, yet again, he discovers an even larger room where he meets another man with a beard. 

Full of hope, he asks again, ""Are you Mohammed?"" 

""No, I am Jesus... You will find Mohammed higher up."" 

Mohammed higher than Jesus!

The poor man can hardly contain his delight and climbs and climbs, ever higher. 

Once again he reaches a larger room where he meets a man with a beard and repeats his question: 


""Are you Mohammed?"" he gasps as he is, by now, totally out of breath from all his
climbing. 

""No my son.....I am God. But you look exhausted. Would you like a coffee?"" 

""Yes, please!"" said the man. 

God looks behind him, claps his hands and calls out:

So of course, when the principal at the time resigned Juan's pupils pushed him to become the next principal and so he decided to give it a shot. At this school, anyone who wants to run for principal has to give a speech to the school's board outlining why they believe they should be the principal, so Juan gets up before the school board and simply says ""I love my wife, I love my kids, I love my dog"" and because everybody loved him he got the position of principal

A few months had passed before the town's mayor decided to resign, and because everybody in town loved Juan they encouraged him to run for mayor. So he gets up in front of the townspeople and says ""I love my wife, I love my kids, I love my dog."", the speech was met with a huge cheer and Juan became the mayor.

Juan had been mayor for a few years before his townspeople decided to encourage him to run to be the next President, so he decides ""why not"" and enters the presidential race. Juan made it all the way to the presidential debates, where he simply said ""I love my wife, I love my kids, I love my dog"", and because every American loved him he was sworn into presidency.

A few months later, Juan was incredibly drunk in the oval office. His wife walked into the office to check on him and in his drunkness, Juan pulled a gun on his wife and shot her. Juan's kids ran to the oval office to see if everything was okay and Juan being the drunk man he was shot them both dead, and a few minutes later the dog walks into the room and was met by a bullet to the face.

Whilst Juan was drunk, he still knew that he had just committed multiple offences and made a run for it, out of the white house and onto the streets.  A few nights passed and Juan decided he needed to catch up on his sleep, so he went into a back alley looking for a dumpster to sleep in and he found one. He opened the lid of the dumpster and was greeted by a homeless man, Juan panics and says ""Sorry sir, I mean no harm"", the homeless man recognised Juan and said ""hang on, aren't you Juan, the guy who shot his wife, kids and dog?"". ""Yes I am, but I mean no harm, I just need a place to sleep"" replied Juan, however, the homeless man didn't take a word of it and pulled out a golf gun.

Just as the bartender asks him what he wants, a professionally-dressed man walks up and says: ""Hold on. I represent Robert, and I am here to deliver a contract specifying which drink he would like, and the price he agrees to pay.""

The bartender thinks this is odd, but the contract is simple, and a customer is a customer, so he agrees to sign it. But before he can, another lawyer walks in. ""One moment,"" he says, ""I represent Mr. Hallson, and I have a document clarifying my client's contract, and explaining how his work is not able to be used to bring a suit against him.""

Again, the bartender looks it over, and again, it is simple and reasonable. But before he agrees, yet another lawyer walks in, and the same thing occurs. This continues until there are 49 lawyers in the room.

Finally, another figure walks in. His dress is impeccable, his stride with a swift confidence and authority that compels you to follow him, just behind his shoulder, hurriedly asking questions that only he can answer. His eyes were steely, and if one looked into them, they would see great legal tomes, which they instinctively recognized as great and valuable, and penned, one and all, by him.

""BEHOLD,"" his voice containing all the confidence of a hot-shot prosecutor, the authority of a Supreme Court Justice, and the measured, certain tones of an experienced defense lawyer.

""I AM THE ALPHA LAWYER AND THE OMEGA LAWYER. I AM THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL OF LITIGATION. I HAVE NEVER LOST A CASE, AND MY LEGALESE HAS NEVER BEEN LESS THAN PERFECT. MY LEGAL AIDES ARE PRAYED TO AS SAINTS, AND MY BLESSINGS ARE SOUGHT THE WORLD OVER. I AM THE GOD OF ATTORNEYS, AND I AM HERE TO REPRESENT MY CLIENT.""

At this point, the bartender is quite annoyed. ""This is ridiculous!"" he exclaims. ""If Robert needs a lawyer to buy a drink, why doesn't he hire you directly?""

The Lawyer stares at him, his gaze firm and unwavering. ""I DO NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH CASES I DO AND DO NOT TAKE,"" he says, gesturing at Robert.
