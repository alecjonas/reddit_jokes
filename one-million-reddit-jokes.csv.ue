Then the German delegate stood up and shared that Germans are great engineers and builders so they should be on the island to build the infrastructure. Finally the Japanese delegate stood and said they are great at moving goods and logistics so there should be someone from Japan on the island. 

The Greeks volunteered their finest chef who was in charge of all the food. The Germans their best engineer who was in charge of building and maintaing the habitat. The Japanese their top logistics person who was solely in charge of supplies. They were shipped to the island for a year with strict orders to work together.

 Amazingly it really works to reveal your all-time favorite movie.

 Each time I got the same answer, and sure enough it IS my very favorite movie EVER!

 1. Pick a number from 1-9. 


 2. Multiply that number by 3. 


 3. Add 3.

On a December trip to Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, Ferdinand Feghoot was summoned to the local college, Wossamotta U. by Inspector Fenwick, the Chief of Police.

There he was confronted with an appalling scene. Bullwinkle, the town's leading citizen, had been smashed flatter than a kippered herring by a falling safe.

""It's a common enough means of death for cartoon characters,"" Fenwick opined. ""Every year, we lose five or six citizens to falling safes. But this time, it was no accident. This time, it's murder!""

He showed Feghoot the ingenious deadfall trap rigged to rain financial ruin on an unsuspecting victim. Bullwinkle's antlers were still entangled in the tripwire. Grasped tightly in one hand was a small statue of a Hindu god.

The dead quadruped's best friend, Rocky the flying squirrel had been with Bullwinkle at the time of his death, but when questioned by Feghoot, the distraught rodent said all he could remember was seeing a rabbi fleeing the scene upon a pogo stick.

Fenwick immediately issued an APB for the rabbi.

""You're wasting your time, Fenwick,"" said Feghoot grimly, as he stood from his examination of the body. ""The rabbi has been framed. When you find him, he will tell you of some elaborate ruse that induced him to be on a pogo stick at this time and place.""

""How do you know that, Feghoot?"" asked the Inspector.

""This is the work of the Christmas Killer,"" Feghoot declared. ""I have been on the trail of this fiend for years, and I fear that we might never catch him. Every December, he arranges one of these grisly messages.""

""Look! Didn't you notice the smile on the victim's face? The corners of his mouth have been propped up... by these!"" He displayed two toothpicks he had taken from Bullwinkle's mouth.

""I still don't see how you know the murderer is the Christmas Killer,"" said Fenwick.

""Isn't it obvious?"" Feghoot asked. ""Wee Vishnu, a merry crushed moose, and a hoppy Jew near.""",Classic Rocky and Bullwinkle pun,104

Sherman: 'I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.'


Teacher:'That's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom at the dinner table. And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us your good manners?'


Johnny: 'I would say: Darling, may I please be excused for a moment? I have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, whom I hope to introduce to you after dinner.'

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.
Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'
The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.
The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.
The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.
'Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'
The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.
The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.
The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.
'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'
The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'
'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.
'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'
And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.
The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.
'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'
The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'
The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.
The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.
'Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'
One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.
The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.
The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.
The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.
'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'
It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.
The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.
'Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.'
That night, the son spent on board the tanker.
The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.
A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.
His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'
Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'
The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'
'Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'
The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.
'Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'
The son nodded weakly.
The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.
'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.
The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.
`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.
`I- I-'

 ""Dude what the hell is wrong with you I have no clue who this Scot or Jeremy is and this is beginning to get annoying! Get the hell out of here"" replied the bald man angrily.

“Don’t worry,” says the mouse. “I know exactly what to do: I’ll go home, get my BMW, drive it back here and I’ll tow you out of this mud.”
The mouse scurries home, climbs into his BMW, drives it back to the woods, throws a rope around the elephant and drags him out of the mud.

“Thank you!” the elephant sighs with relief. “How will I ever repay you?”

“I’m sure someday you’ll think of something,” the mouse replies.

“Don’t worry, dear mouse,” the elephant replies. “I know precisely what to do: I’ll unfurl my colossal cock and you can climb all the way up it to safety.” The elephant takes a moment to himself and then drops his throbbing erection into the mud. The mouse grabs onto the head of his friend’s huge organ, scales the considerable length of the shaft (with enough girth to provide an amply wide path), jumps onto the elephant’s back and slides down his trunk to safety. The mouse and the elephant then walk out of the woods together and live happily ever after.

He is smart, funny, charming, attractive...a real catch.  She meets her friends at a bar and tells them about this man.  Obviously, her friends are very excited for her!  They congratulate her on her new boyfriend.

A few dates in, she discovers that her boyfriend is also fabulously wealthy!  He apologizes for keeping it a secret, but explains that he has had problems with gold diggers and wanted to make sure she actually liked him.  She really does, and this is no bad news, so she's fine with it.  The woman meets her friends at the bar and tells them of this new development.  Unsurprisingly, they are even more excited for her now.

She tells her friends that after the next date, she will spend the night with him for the first time.

The next evening, her friends walk into the bar to find her sitting with a beer.  They ask her about her date, to which she only replies, ""I spent the night but I'm not telling you how it was.  I won't kiss and tell!""  Her friends all giggle, assuming that the date went very well.

This happens for several more dates.  The friends always meet her in the bar the next evening, and she always tells them, ""I spent the night but I'm not telling you how it was!""

However, one night her friends enter the bar to find the woman slumped over a root beer float, chin resting on her fist, stirring the concoction slowly with a blank look on her face.  Of course, they ask her what's wrong.

""He proposed last night, and I said yes.  But with his immense fortune, he didn't just give me an engagement ring.  To show he was serious, he gave me the land title to a narrow canyon about 10 miles away.  Apparently it's filled with veins and deposits of precious metals.""

She pulls the deed to the mine out of her purse and sets it on the counter.  The woman's friends jump and scream with delight - what a fantastic outcome to their friend's fabulous relationship!  But then the nearest friend remembers why they asked her what was wrong in the first place.  She asks again...if she is now in this incredible engagement, what's the problem?

""Well...it just sank in that I'm going to be with him and him alone for the rest of my life.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I never told you how he was in bed.  I guess...well...giving me an ore chasm is the closest we're gonna get.""",A woman starts dating a new man...,4

BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period.

JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.

HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road?

GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.

DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?

BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.

AL GORE: I invented the chicken.

JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.

AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?

DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.

OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.

ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.

NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.

PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.

MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.

DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.

GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?

COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",So why did the chicken cross the road?,80

WE DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER"".  Their mom was having none of it and went out anyways to pick up the new babysitter.

A few hours later, she came home and said, ""Kids, this is Jenny your new babysitter.  I am leaving on a business trip for a few days, so Jenny will watch you while I'm gone.""  After their mother left, Ben, Mary and Jenny sat down and watched some TV for a while, ate dinner and finally went to bed at around 9.  

Ben was lying in bed naked about to fall asleep when he heard the door of his room open slowly.  He sat up quickly and there was Jenny standing in the doorway.  He shouted ""JENNY! What are you doing in here?""  Without making even a noise, Jenny hopped on the bed and started giving oral sex to Ben.  Ben didn't know what to do and just allowed it to happen.  After a few minutes he couldn't take it anymore, got himself propped up, and started having sex with Jenny.  After it was over, Jenny left the room and Ben fell right asleep.  

The next night, Ben and Mary went to bed at 9 again.  Ben laid in bed for a while hoping Jenny would come back in.  About an hour went by and she wasn't there yet, so he decided to go and see what she was up to. 

After looking in most of the rooms in the house, he couldn't find Jenny anywhere.  He walked back towards his room, and when he walked by Mary's room, he heard a loud moan.  He opened Mary's door, and there was Jenny, furiously going to town between Marys legs. 

 ""MARY!!! JENNY!!! WHAT IS GOING ON?"" He screamed.  Mary then shot up and looked at Ben and said ""BEN, I NEED A DICK! COME MAKE LOVE TO ME""  ""BUT YOUR MY SISTER, I CANT DO THAT"" ""JUST DO IT BEN I NEED IT""

Ben and Mary had sex and then laid down on the bed afterwards.  ""Wow that was great!"" Said Mary. ""It was, but we can NEVER tell Mom about this!"" Ben then said.  

Mary agreed, and then they both looked at Jenny.  Ben said to Jenny ""Thanks Jenny! If it wasn't for you we would have never done this.  You're the best dog a family ever had!"" ","[NSFW] Two siblings, Ben and Mary, were told by their single mother she got a new babysitter....",0

The men looked at each other and agreed to participate.  

The Knight then told them the first test was ""Go further into the forest and find me 10 of the same tree nut and bring them back to me, or you will be killed.""

The three men turned to begin gathering and quickly remarked to eachother how easy the tests were, and then went their separate ways to begin gathering.

The nanny, we will consider her the working class

Skeptical, Jake goes fishing. Sure enough, he catches the gold fish, and the fish asks him what's his wish. Surprised, because he wasn't really expecting it, he looks around and says - ""see that shed near my house? Fill it with gold!"". Fish says ok and disappears.

Excited, Jake goes to the shed ... only to find it empty, but with the walls full of mold. Disappointed, he goes to his friend John to complain... to which, John says:  ""I told you to be loud. What, do you think that I wanted my *tennis* to be the best in the world?""

'Just a minute', she said while walking towards the door to lock it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’, she asked.

Well, I was so dumbstruck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and threw it on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ I climbed on her and it was so wonderful; but unfortunately, I was unable hold it back and next thing I knew: KAPOWWWWW. I was done within a few moments.

The room is quiet and no one takes up the Texan's offer. One man even leaves. Thirty minutes later the same gentleman who left shows back up and taps the Texan on the shoulder. ""Is your bet still good?"", asks the Irishman.

The Texan says yes and asks the bartender to line up 10 pints of Guinness. Immediately the Irishman tears into all 10 of the pint glasses drinking them all back-to-back. The other pub patrons cheer as the Texan sits in amazement.

The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and says, ""If ya don't mind me askin', where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone?""
The Irishman replies, ""Oh...I had to go to the pub down the street to see if I could do it first"".",A Texan walks into an Irish pub...,273

This was back in the 90s, so who wasn't one back then?. And by professional I mean ""full-time job,"" not the ""I do drunk open-mic nights"" type.

There was an understanding in the industry. If your shit is funny, it will be stolen. It was part of the game. But just like musicians or any other artists, if someone else does it better, then you have to cede to them. If you're a singer, someone covers your song and effin kills it, you let them. Do you think anyone calls Johnny Cash a ""song thief"" when he recorded NIN's ""Hurt?"" Of course not. Because he took the material and made it his. Comedy is the same way. One of my best sets included a bit (about Pokemon and orphans) that killed every time. One guy who I knew from the circuit came up to me and told me that he was using my bit and asked me if I wanted to compare notes. I watched him perform and he took it to a whole new level. Never used it again because he performed it so much better than I ever could. The bastard.

I'm guilty of it too. You usually have to when you're starting. When you get up there for the first time at open-mics and you're trying to find your voice, new content is one of the the last things on your mind. You spend about two minutes making it up and about two months working it into your act. That story that always makes your friends piss themselves laughing? It'll be about six weeks before you realize the audience thinks it (and you) are retarded for using it.

Hey, have a funny thought in the shower? Jot that down. Maybe you can stretch that one thought out for 30, 40 seconds. If you're really talented, a minute. You'll need at least a dozen of those thoughts to pad out an 8 minute set for open-mic, and trust me, to make a name for yourself you need some new stuff each time you get up there. Ready to open for someone? Those sets are usually 23 or 34 minutes. You do the math, because math is hard. Short of it is, at some point every SUC hears something, makes them laugh, fits in with their style, and they use it. It's more of the norm than you think. Especially since most watch a lot of other comics, then has a funny thought later and can't remember if it was original or not. That happens too. And honestly, it takes a lot more work to fit someone else's joke into your set. They have different timing, style and personality. It's when you start headlining that almost all your material is original, and that's probably still riddled with borrowed ideas that you tweaked, rewrote, rewrote again, tested, rewrote, reworked to fit in somewhere else, tested. rewrote, lather, rinse, repeat.

Now it's different when all you use only ""borrowed"" material. We all knew SUCs like that, ones that if we saw them in the audience we would not use our ""A"" material. There are comics out there that only know how to regurgitate. Those people suck. Especially the ones that become super-famous doing it. We all know who they are, but luckily they're rare.

There is one comic that did get famous, is still performing, and I've heard him recently use one of my 15 year old jokes. And it always gets a laugh. I get a little jealous when I hear him use it, but a little proud too.

tl;dr Jokes get borrowed, reworked and reused all the time. It happens. But if you're talented and can make it work in your set, more power to you.

They took with them their best friend, Bill, who was a college drop-out and a former drug addict who's now sober and helping his dad's business.

John and Andy thought bringing Bill along would be helpful for his personal growth and Bill agreed to tag along.

During the trip, John and Andy always made interpretations out of everything they saw interesting.

When they saw kids lying under the bridge, they talked about poverty.

When they saw kids ordering many plates of expensive desserts, they talked about gluttony.

When they saw wild dogs running, they talked about freedom.

When they saw dogs being walked by their owners, they talked about captivity.

All the while, Bill only observed and stayed quiet, occasionally playing with his phone.

After walking dozens of miles, they reached a mountainous region where they decided to camp for the night.

They built a tent, reflected on their journey so far and when the hours were getting late, they went to sleep.

In the middle of the night, Bill suddenly woke up, and he woke John and Andy up as well.

""Look up, tell me what you see"", asked Bill.

Both John and Andy were immediately amazed at what they saw; beautiful formations of uncountable stars in the sky.

They started telling each other and Bill about their very own interpretations out of this scenery.

After delivering their deep, long, elaborated speeches, they then asked Bill his thinking, upon which Bill replied:

""this means.... our tent has been stolen""

D comes in and heads for the bathroom, saying, ""Excuse me; I'll just be a second."" Then A comes in, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor.
