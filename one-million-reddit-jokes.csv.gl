When the trooper asked the driver why he was speeding, the driver said he was a Magician and Juggler and was on his way to Atlanta to do a show for the Children’s Hospital. He didn't want to be late. The trooper told the driver he was fascinated by juggling and said if the driver would do a little juggling for him then he wouldn't give him a ticket.

He told the trooper he had sent his equipment ahead and didn't have anything to juggle. The trooper said he had some flares in the trunk and asked if he could juggle them. The juggler said he could, so the trooper got 5 flares, lit them and handed them to him.

While the man was juggling, a car pulled in behind the State Troopers car. A drunken good old boy from Byron got out, watched the performance, then went over to the Trooper's car, opened the rear door and got in.

The trooper observed him and went over to his car, opened the door asking the drunk what he thought he was doing. The drunk replied, “You might as well take me to jail, cause there ain't no way I can pass that test.”

&amp;nbsp;

""There's no stop in Gladstone on Wednesdays,"" replied the conductor.

""What!"" Exclaimed the businessman.

""There's no stop in Gladstone on Wednesdays.""

""But it's imperative. I have an important meeting there.""

The conductor is adamant. ""This is the weekly express service and there's no stop in Gladstone on Wednesdays.""

&amp;nbsp;

After much argument a compromise was reached. The conductor agreed to ask the driver to slow down to 60 kilometres an hour as the train went though Gladstone. He would then hold the businessman out of the carriage window, the businessman could get his legs running in thin air as fast as he could and when the conductor thought his leg speed was sufficient he would lower him down onto the platform.

&amp;nbsp;

So when the train reached Gladstone this plan was put into action and the businessman hit the platform running at full speed. He ran the full length of the platform, hoping he could stop himself before the end.

Just as the last carriage of the train was passing him by, his collar was grabbed by the strong arm of a shearer who heaved him back onboard through an open window.

She would ball her fists, start to breathe heavy through her nose, turn red and glare. She had never learned to control her emotions and regularly ended up snapping at people. People would often ignore her or snap back which only spurred her on. 

She soon graduated to screaming in people’s faces, even going so far as to one morning spitting in the vicar’s wife’s face for taking her intended car park. “Why are you like this, my dear? Won’t you please calm down?” the vicar’s wife asked in a gentle voice. Startled by this gentle approach she burst into tears “I can’t!” she cried back at her. She dove back into her car and fled, shamed for the first time. 

One day she is driving into town hoping to get a bargain from the annual sale at the village’s only clothes boutique. She’d had her eye on a particular dress. She parked and walked in only to see the vicar’s wife at the counter, with the very same dress in a tote and accepting her receipt. 

The fiery young woman remembered their last encounter but couldn’t stop the wave of anger building. She balled her fists, started to huff and puff and stomped resolutely towards the older woman, bearing down like a freight train. 

The vicar’s wife turned her head and worked out in an instant what had happened. She held up one small wrinkled hand, which stopped the young woman in her tracks and before she could open her mouth, the vicar’s wife said, “I’ve been thinking and I know how to help you. Come with me.”

Puzzled and curious, the young woman followed her out of the boutique. She was still furious, how dare she not return the dress. She must know I wanted it! she thought to herself. The vicar’s wife toddled onwards ahead of her to the stationery shop. The clerk looked worried for the older woman and the other’s temper visibly continued to mount. But he placed her requested items into a bag. 

The vicar’s wife peacefully continued on out the door, calmly checking that the young woman was still following. She walked to the nearby bench seat, sat her down, and passed her the package. “This better be good, old woman!” She snapped and dumped the contents onto her lap. A pen, some beautifully fine ruled paper and a dozen envelopes tumbled out. “What’s this about?!” She snarled. 

The vicar’s wife said, “Humour me. Write down what I did to upset you so, my dear, then mark the envelope out to God. It will reduce your anger and bring you peace.” Again, shamed by her gentleness, the young woman softened slightly, scowled and scribbled a note about how selfish the older woman always was and that she took her dress. The vicar’s wife pointed to the letterbox and the young woman stomped over to it and thrust the letter through the slot. 

“I’m still furious, you dumb old witch!” She said. The vicar’s wife passed her another sheet and said to try again. She scribbled another note, shoved it into the envelope to God and dropped it in the box. To her surprise she felt a little better! Without being prompted she wrote another note and then another and another until every worry she’d had all week was spilled onto paper and on its way to god. 

She sat back down, sighed and smiled at the vicar’s wife, took her hand gently and said, “Thank-you. You were right. Reposting IS the best way to get calmer.”

Edit: I have an Australian accent. Sorry mericans. 😊",A young woman in a smallish village was well known for her quick temper and violent outbursts,13

The general ordered his men to stop and directed his attention towards the source of the noise. A single highland warrior was standing alone at the top of a small hill, yelling at the oncoming army.

""Come ahead ya big Jessies, I'll gut the lot of ye's!""

The Roman general, not one to have his honour so openly slighted, ordered three of his soldiers to end the highlanders taunts. As they approached the warrior he stopped his ranting  and disappeared behind the ridge of the hill. The soldiers followed him and the general heard the clash of steel. After a brief moment of silence the highland warrior reappeared with blood on his kilt and sword.

""That aw ya got, ya bunch a choobs?""

Irritated the general ordered ten of his men to engage the man. Again the warrior stopped shouting and disappeared behind the ridge before the soldiers got to him. The clashing of steel lasted longer this time but again the highlander reappeared and again he started to taunt them. 

""Are ya no gonae gie me a real fight, ya travelling band of wank stains."" 

Enraged the general ordered one hundred of his legionaries to charge the warrior. Once more the highlander made his way out of sight behind the ridge and this time the sounds of battle lasted for a long while. Whilst the clashing of steel continued one of the Roman soldiers reappeared, bloodied and bruised, over the ridge. 

""My liege, you must turn back! It's a trap!"" He called to his general.

""There's two of them!""

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

He approaches it, and discovers that someone has peed ""Trump is a fuckup,"" on his pristine white house lawn.    

Outraged, he calls the Secret Service and demands and investigation be made.   The Secret Service claims they are still reviewing the punch bowl incident during the New Years party, and Trump threatens to restaff the entire property if these disrespectful heathens were not brought to justice by midnight.  

That evening, Trump gets a visitor from the lead investigator of ""Operation Yellow on White.""   The investigator looks obviously rattled, as if he is aware that he truly is a bearer of bad news.  

""So, what did Youse Guys find out about the piece of shit that ruined my perfect lawn?""  The president asks.  ""He better be sitting in a holding cell with a car battery and some jumper cables within reach, right now.""

""Mister President, sir.  We have finished the investigation, and we have two lead suspects.  We discovered small traces of semen, frozen but intact, in the message.  A DNA analysis concluded that the semen belonged to Former President William Jefferson Clinton.""

Trump slams his baby sized hand against the Oval office desk, making a sound akin to salami being thrown against a tile wall.   ""THAT LIBERAL PIECE OF SHIT!  HE IS TRYING TO UNDERMINE MY ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION WITH THIS!"" the man raves, his usually orange completion flushing with crimson.    ""I WANT YOU TO ISSUE A WARRANT FOR BILL AND HIS CROOKED HILARY ON CHARGES OF TREASON!""

The investigator, knowing that this exchange is a dumpster fire in the making, clears his throat and dips his chin downward a mere inch.   ""...Mister President.  Senator Clinton was in New York when this incident occured.  Multiple eyewitnesses confirmed it, as did satellite imagery.""  The investigator explains.   

Seething, Trump slings a stack of files from his desk, scattering them across the entire oval office in a whirlwind of top-secret classified rage.  ""THEN WHO HELPED THAT HILLBILLY RUIN MY FUCKING LAWN, AGENT?!"" 

The agent clears his throat.  ""Mister President.   Sir.  We analyzed the handwriting.  It was matched with 99% accuracy that it belongs to your wife.""

Nevertheless, he enters into a local competition, and finds that his zen approach to life yields positive returns to his technique. He waits patiently for his opponent to make an error, and quickly strikes at the opening. He repeats this, and surprise of surprises, wins his first tournament. His teacher is shocked, and convinces him to try at higher levels of competition. 

No longer reluctant, he does, and wins again. And again. The teacher is astonished and proud. She approaches him after a national competition.

""Congratulations on your victory,"" she says.

""Win or lose, it is all one,"" the monk says wisely.

""That may be, but it is still impressive that you have come so far so fast. You're by far the best student I have ever had. But tell me one thing: you never attack first.

The old man had at the table with him a glue stick and a few sheets of construction paper and he seemed to be engaged in some kinds of arts-and-crafts project. The waitstaff occasionally shot him a confused look but otherwise avoided him.

The host told me I'd have to wait a few minutes while they cleared off a table for me so I decided to find out what this old man was doing. ""Are you making a collage?"" I asked. ""I haven't done that since grade school.""

The old man looked up from his gluing, gave me a quizzical look, and asked in a loud voice, ""NO, I NEVER MADE IT TO COLLEGE, LET ALONE GRAD SCHOOL. WHY DO YOU ASK?""

I stood there blinking for a moment, wondering how to respond politely to this clearly hard-of-hearing old man. Meanwhile the old man returned to his work. He stripped apart the pieces of construction paper he'd glued together, slathered the backing piece down with fresh glue, and started to reassemble it.

The host waved me over to my freshly-cleared table so I figured I'd just end the conversation. ""SORRY TO BOTHER YOU SIR, I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU WERE DOING OVER HERE."" I shouted so that the old man could hear me over the din of the restaurant.

In an equally loud but far more exasperated voice, the old man answered, ""I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THEM TO BRING ME SOME FOOD! I KEEP HEARING THAT REPASTING IS HOW YOU GET GREAT KORMA AROUND HERE, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING FOR ME.""",I went for lunch at an Indian restaurant,63

This is Peter next door. I’m sorry buddy, but I have a confession to make to you. I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can’t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing. 

The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you, particularly in the mornings after you've left for work. I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much… I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. I promise that it won't happen again.
 
Regards, Peter
 
THE ACTIONS
 
Steve, feeling anguished and betrayed, immediately went into his bedroom, grabbed his gun, and without a word, shot his wife twice, killing her instantly. 

He returned to the lounge where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone to respond to the neighbour's text and saw he had another message:-
 
THE REPLY
 
Hi Steve. 

This is Peter next door again. Sorry about the slight typo on my last text, I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you noticed, my predictive text changed ‘WiFi’ To ‘Wife’. Technology hey?!? Hope you saw the funny side of that.

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

This year at the fair, the pilot overheard this and said, ""I'll let you both fly for free, but only if you don't scream, talk, or make any noises.”

The wife and husband agree and  hop into the plane.

They take off and the pilot is listening...not a peep. He begins to do some twists and steep turns...still not a word. Finally he does an aerial flip, but even that didn't make them gasp.

The pilot decides to give up and brings the plane down to land.

He yells back at the husband as he was taxiing, “I pulled every trick in the book, but I guess you both have nerves of steel. What did you think about the flight?""

The husband replies, ""Well, it was certainly what I imagined it would be like although I wanted to scream when my wife fell out of the plane but you know...twenty bucks is twenty bucks.""",An elderly man and his wife went to the state fair every year,41

Students were really annoyed by this behaviour of the fat ugly teacher. Being intellectual science and technology students, instead of complaining or discussing this with other faculties, they decided to come up with the reason behind such strange behaviour of the giant fat ugly teacher. 

Some students reported - Its because she is annoying, she must have been lonely - all by herself - till now, so being surrounded by all the students made her feel good. 

Some said - its because she is ugly she waited in the class till all the other professors changed their classes, so when she leaves she wont have to show ugly her face to others. 

As a student of science I think I have found the reason. Its the laws of physics itself. I do not think there is a solution available to this problem. Her perception of time is a bit different, a bit faster if you say. She thinks she spent just an hour in the class when for us - the students - its one hour and 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Excuse me miss, i can't help but notice you crying is there anything i can do to help?""

&amp;#x200B;

She looks up, ""Well I've never been down to the beach before as i can't use the stairs and it looks so lovely""

&amp;#x200B;

""I can help"" the man says ""I will lift you down there if you like and take you back when you'r finished?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh sir that would be so nice thank you!""

&amp;#x200B;

So he lifts her out of the chair and takes her down to the beach. He lays his towel down and the woman sits smiling.

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you so so much"" she smiles ""Can i please ask another favor?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure"" he says

&amp;#x200B;

""Well its so lovely down here i really wish i could hold someones hand for a while, can you sit and hold mine?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man i really looking forward to a swim but cant deny this request. ""Okay"" So he sits next to her and holds her hand.

&amp;#x200B;

After a moment the woman quietly says ""Can you please do me another favor, I have never been kissed before, would you please kiss me.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man is starting to feel a little uncomfortable but also feels sympathetic. ""Okay"" He leans over and pecks her on the cheek.  She smiles and giggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

The woman again asks a favor ""Please sir can you please do something else for me, I have never had my boobs touched before, would you please?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Now miss i really don't want to. I think I have done enough today for you""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman starts crying, ""Please sir"" 

&amp;#x200B;

The man not wanting to see her cry and reluctantly reaches out and quickly squeezes one of breasts, giggling again the woman seems happy.

&amp;#x200B;

""Now i really want to go for a swim miss, I will be back soon and can take you up the stairs.""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman starts crying again, ""Please sir before you go, can you do me another favor? I have never been french kissed before and really want to try""

&amp;#x200B;

""No miss, I have been very nice to you but that is too far for me and I really don't want to.""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman continues sobbing. A little more dramatic than before. ""Please sir, I really want to try french kissing, please!""

&amp;#x200B;

The man has had enough but still doesn't want to see her crying. He leans over and quickly french kisses the woman. As he pulls away he gets up to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

The woman now starts crying and moaning loudly. ""Whats wrong now miss? I have done everything you asked and gone beyond. I am going for a swim now that's it!""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman is howling now"" PLEASE SIR JUST ONE MORE THING.. PLEASE!!??""

&amp;#x200B;

The guy is very frustrated and asked ""WHAT NOW?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well"" she says between sobbing ""I've never been fucked before, please sir I really want to try""

&amp;#x200B;

The man snaps. He picks the woman up and they walk into the water until its deep then he lets her go. As he is swimming off he yells ""Now your fucked""",A man goes to a beach one day,5

post,acbobx,2qh72,jokes,false,1546558002,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/acbobx/the_ghost_joke/,self.jokes,," Once when I was travelling in the deep south of the USA, I decided to try and understand the culture there. 

  
  I was invited by one of my co-workers to attend an evangelical preachers event, where I could see something that was really “out there” 

  
  We went along to a large stadium that seated around 40,000 people. The event was full and everyone was quite excited to be there. The atmosphere was electric. Upon entering I was amazed at the setup, there were lights everywhere , the sound was loud , the crowd was pumped and it was more like a rock concert than going to a church function.  In order to get the crowd to a fever pitch there were bands on before the preachers and there was even a very famous pop singer came on to do a song. 

  
  The first preacher then came on , he started with a bang. Literally there were fireworks and pyrotechnics. This was some event! 

  
  He started preaching in his best preachers voice 

  
  “Is everyone having a good time tonight” he shouted 

  
  The crowd loved it and cheered back 

  
  “Im here to talk to you TONIGHT about the afterlife” 

  
  The crowd cheers again. 

  
  “I travel from the EAST to the WEST , all over this wide land talking about connecting people with the other side.  I ask the PEOPLE about their connection with the other side!” 

  
  The crowd hangs on every word , and people are quite overcome with the emotion of the situation. There are people yelling out things like “Praise Be!”   

  
  “I ask the people when I travel around , and I ask them “Have you EVER... EVER.... seen a GHOST?”” 

  
  Lights go on , wild music starts playing and the crowd goes wild.  The spotlights pick out people in the crowd that have put their hands up. People near those with their hands in the air are pounding them on the back and pointing them out to others near them.  About 20 percent of the crowd have seen a ghost. 

  
  “Thats amazing” the preacher yells “Praise those blessed people , and praise the afterlife” 

  
  The crowd is lapping the whole thing up without exception. They are all on their feet chanting and stamping their feet.      
  The sound stops and the lights go down again. 

  
  “ I travel from the EAST to the WEST , all over this wide land and I ask the PEOPLE questions” The preacher has the people in the palm of his hand.   “ I ask the PEOPLE.. Have you EVER... EVER..... TOUCHED a ghost?” 

  
  The lights remain low.   
    
  The crowd goes silent. 

  
  Some of the people in the crowd raise their hand. Around 500 people have touched a ghost. 

  
  The lights pick up the people with their hands up. The music starts up again. The crowd loses..its...mind.   
  “GIVE THOSE PEOPLE A CHEER” the preacher yells. Sweat pours off his face. He runs frantically around the stage. 

  
  The people with their hands up stand up.. everyone is cheering. The music is blaring.  

   
  “Now... everyone quiet down now”   
  The music again stops. The lights dim.  The crowds sits down expectantly awaiting the next revelation.   
  The preacher begins again in hushed tones. 

  
  “I travel from the EAST to the WEST, from the NORTH to the SOUTH , all over this wide land.  I have NEVER , EVER heard an affirmative to this question” 

  
  The crowd is hushed, what could it be? 

  
  “Has anyone, out there, tonight, who has ever, ever,  FUCKED A GHOST?”   
  The crowd is amazed. 

  
  Everyone is silent, there is not a movement in the whole stadium.   
  The preacher has his hand shielding his eyes , searching the crowd.  The ushers in the crowd are scanning everyone in their area.  The crowd are craning their neck looking around. 

  
  Then – one person – way in the back of the crowd puts his hand tentative in the air.      
  His neighbors, unbelieving nudge each other. Could it be true?   
  They elbow him and encourage him to lift his hand up. 

  
  Other people in the area look around.  Someone starts clapping.  The usher looks over , sees the guy and excitedly raises his hand up to signal he has seen something.   

  
  One single spotlight swings around over the crowd.  It picks the solitary man up and more people turn around.  More people start clapping. The guy gets more confident, raising his hand as high as it will go. 

  
  The preacher notices the excitement way in the back of the arena , his eyes go wide in disbelief. He stumbles over to the edge of the stage and looks out.     

  
  “Can this be true?” The preacher says in amazement. 

  
  More lights swing over to the solitary man in the crowd.  He is now lit up and the whole section is clapping and cheering for him. People are slapping him on the back. His eyes are wild with pride. 

  
  “ITS A MIRACLE” The preacher screams 

  
  The lights all go on.  The music blares at top volume.  

   
  “COME ON DOWN” the preacher yells , motioning with both his arms flailing the man should come down to the stage.   
  The man stands up tentatively, but with the cheers of the crowd gathers confidence as he slowly works his way to the aisle.      
  He gets to the aisle and starts walking down.   
  “GIVE THAT GUY AN HALLELUJAH” The preacher screeches.    

  
  The entire crowd screams out.  The man is boosted again and starts jogging down.   
The preacher is jumping wildly on the stage. 

  
  The man , increasing in confidence with every step starts pumping his fist in the air as he is running down to the stage.   
  The crowd is jumping up and down in unison. People are crying and weeping. Old ladies are fainting.  Men are foaming at the mouth and speaking in tongues. Its a frenzy of activity. 

  
  The man reaches the stage.  Pyrotechnics explode while balloons are dropping from the roof. The balloons catch fire and land on the crowd. No one minds as they are so enthralled by the display. A dance team comes up behind the preacher followed by a full choir. 

  
  The choir sings at the top of their voice.     
  People lift the man up on their shoulders and carry him to the stage. 

  
  “HALLELUJAH AND PRAISE BE” the preacher pants. Both him and the man are out of breath.   
  The music drops and the crowd goes into a hushed silence 

  
  “Now tell everyone – out there , how you fucked a ghost” 

  
  The man looks confused, looks over to the preacher and says 

  
  “Ghost?  I thought you said goat!”

Soon he was feeling the urge to have sex again so once again he turned to his camel. The camel refused and started running away again. So, he caught up to it again and go on it again.

Finally after riding the camel through the whole desert the man came to a road. There was a broken down car with three big chested beautiful blondes sitting in it. He went up to them and asked the women if they needed any help.

The hottest girl said, ""If you fix our car we will do anything you want."" The man luckily knew a thing or two about cars and fixed it in a flash. When he finished are three girls asked, ""How could we ever repay you mister."" After thinking for a short while he replied, ""Could you hold my camel?""",A man was riding through the desert on his camel.,15

The joke itself was somewhat controversial.

After hearing the joke, one of his classmates reported him to the school staff for nothing other then the fact that they were butthurt and super disliked it.  

Two others reported it to the staff because he was stole the joke from another student.  Of course, the staff ignored the report because the students were too damn lazy to read to school’s bulletin board.  

Three brave students reported it as they thought the kid was a robot, obviously not true, and as such they were found and expelled from the school.

In the end, none of the reports did anything to the joke and it kept being told over and over again in the school.

It’s really too bad, telling stolen jokes for popularity.

He tried lacrosse, but couldn't get the hang of it, and failed out during his second year.  His third year, he tried polo but again, was not coordinated enough and was also afraid of the horses. 

During his fourth year, the school let him know that if he didn't pass a physical education elective he wouldn't be graduating with the rest of the class.  So in desperation he took fencing class, but with his utter lack of skill was easy to defeat.  Any time he managed to parry an opponent's attack he'd perform a quick thrust, which after the 2nd or third time everyone expected and was able to counter.  

Frustrated with his student the fencing instructor bellowed, ""Why do you always use the same strategy in every match?!"" The student responded, ""Sorry, but riposting is all I know."" ",There was a young boy in a rich family going to a prestigious university.,10

He wandered around trying to figure out what to do when he came across a camel salesman.  He said ""I'd like to buy a camel please to take me to Cairo.""   

  
The salesman replied, ""Well sir, I only have one camel left, and it is a trained circus camel, so not only is it more expensive than normal but you'd have to be taught how to ride it.""   But the business man didn't want to waste any more time so he said, ""Fine fine whatever I'll take it.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the salesman got everything set for the guy and then said, ""Okay sir, here's how to make the camel work.   He does not respond to prodding and pulling and kicking and yanking.  To make him go, you have to blow in his ear.  and to make him stop you yank on his tail.  This is the only way to control him.  Good luck.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the business man thanks the salesman and begins walking the camel  to the edge of town.  When he gets there he mounts the camel and says, ""Giddyup Camel"".  But of course the camel doesn't move.  The Businessman then snaps the reins and yells, ""GIT ON CAMEL!"" But nothing happens.  Well he's getting mad now, but then remembers oh shit, this camel is a circus trained camel.  So he leans down and blows in the camel's ear, and LO and behold the camel starts walking.  Well the businessman wants to get where he's going before dark, so he blows a little harder and the camel starts to trot.  He then blows one more time really hard and the camel RIPS ass across the desert in a blaze of camel glory.  This camel is fast as shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is going fine for an hour or two, when the business man starts to hear something that sounds like water.   He strains his eyes and ears and can't really see anything at first, but then he see's a cliff up ahead.   He thinks to himself, that's really weird to see a cliff in the desert, but I better slow down just in case its real.   So he pulls back on the camel's reins a bit, but nothing happens.   The businessman thinks to himself this dumbass camel can't do anything right.  He pulls reallllly hard on the reins, and nothing happens again, except that this cliff seems to be getting closer and closer.   Then finally the businessman remembers, It's a circus trained camel, so he pulls on the camels tail, and the camel slows to a quick jog. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Cliff is like 50 yards ahead, and is seeming more and more real at this point.  So he pulls harder on the tail, and the camel slows to a trot but doesn't seem to have any intention of stopping.  (self preservation be damned).   They are like 5 yards from the edge now and the business man YANKS on the tail with all his might, and the camel screeches to a halt right at the edge of a VERY real cliff with a thousand foot dropoff.

Jack was surprised to find out that Hadid also took up a career in stand up comedy and became immensely popular in Saudi Arabia, so much so that he asked his old friend Jack to fly back with him and maybe open up one of his events. Done and Done.

They fly back, Hadid shows him around, all is swell. The night of the show comes. Jack walks on stage and does all of his best material, all the crowd pleasers he knows, but only gets a lukewarm response at best. Chuck it to karma he thinks.

Up goes Hadid, does his routine and the crowd goes wild. Laughter could be heard from outside the theatre. Chanting and ancor's sound off well into the night. Super impressed with the reaction, Jack asks Hadid what is his secret?

**""My friend""** says Hadid **""It's not what you say, it's the execution that makes them laugh"".**

Jack doesn't quite understand, but is to embarrassed to ask further.

A couple of days go by and they tune down the sightseeing until one morning Hadid asks him if he wants to see something special? Thinking nothing of it Jack accepts. By noon they travel to a public square were the death penalty was being administered to 3 criminals during a public execution.

&amp;#x200B;

The salesman then gets the brilliant idea of smearing shoe cream all over his face so that he can check in to one of the black hotels.

When entering the hotel the receptionist asks if he wants to be waken up in the morning to which the salesman responds that he does. He then goes up to his room and falls asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning he gets a phone call from the reception wishing him a good morning. He gets up and makes his way out of the hotel in search for a bus when he realizes that he still has shoe cream in his face. This would of course stop him from getting a bus since only white people were allowed on buses back then.

&amp;#x200B;

He quickly finds a public restroom and starts scrubbing of the shoe cream but to his surprise it wont come off. He scrubs and scrubs but nothing happens. In panic he looks at himself in the mirror and realizes...

”Terrible, doctor, terrible.”

”Did it not work?”

”Yes,” the old lady said, ”It worked. I did as you said and he got up and ripped his clothes off right then and there and we made mad love on the table. It was the best sex that I’d had in 25 years.”

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around.  He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him.  He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter.  He explained his situation, the old man. ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …"" said the old man, and then he stopped. ""Except what?"" asked the businessman. ""Nothing, nothing,"" said the old man. ""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" protested the businessman. ""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'"" the old man said. ""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" the businessman asked.  The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.  He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.  The businessman laughed, and said, ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"" The old man said, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole.  The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.  Before the door could split, the old man said, ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, ""I'll take it!"" The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash.  The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.  She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!""  The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping.  It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting.  She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.  Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.  So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.  She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.   On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman.  He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.  Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"" ",There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip.,39

He travels to the farest corners of the world looking to reinvigorate his love of the blade. 

He travels to France and challenges their most skilled and famous fighter, but to his disappointment, he beats him within seconds. 

Next he visits Russia, and is challenged by the great Tzar himself; However the Tzar is struck down in two lightning quick stabs. This angers the Russian military who launch a full-scale attack on Maximilian. ""Finally, at least I will die fighting the hardest battle of my life"" he thinks. However as wave after wave of soldier is struck down by Max's quick sword he grows restless and gives up hope. Not even the entire military force of Russia could prove any challenge to the legendary sword fighter. 

He walked out of the country, casually fighting his way through hoards of enemies as easily as swatting flies. Eventually he stopped being followed. 

Max walked for a long time contemplating his fate. "" Perhaps this skill is a curse rather than a blessing"" he began to think. ""What is the purpose of skill if you can no longer be challenged?"" 

He continued his sad journey fighting many gifted swordsmen along the way. Not a single one came close to his skill. He didn't even have to use his right hand for any of them. 

Eventually he came to the Himalayas. He had heard of a fencing master who just might be the solution to his problem, though his hopes were low. He climbed the mountains, almost freezing to death on the way. ""What good are fencing skills when you can't even make a fire"" thought Max.

After an ardous journey Max found a beautiful buddisht temple. Inside he could faintly hear the sound of clashing swords. Excited he ran to the large double doors and used the giant iron knockers. The clashing of the swords stopped. The door opened, and out stepped a Monk. ""How may I help you?"" The Monk inquired? "" I am Maximilian Lee, legendary fencing master. I have travelled all the land looking for a worthy opponent but have found none. You are the last I've come to challenge"". Maximilian declared. 

""I see."" Said the Monk. ""In that case, en garde!"" And he pulled his sword from it's sheathe. The monks moves were fast as lighting and Max struggled to keep up. He tried for a jab but was easily parried by the Monk, then jabbed himself is his left arm! Max switched hands for the first time in decades, attacking even more ferociously with his right hand. But even so, for every attack the Monk would parry easily and Max would receive a stab somewhere on his body as payment. After this happened several times he had to ask the Monk. ""How on Earth did you become so skilled at parrying??"" The Monk replied calmly, ""My son, have you any idea the karma to be gained from a riposte?""","One day, legendary fencing master Maximilian Lee is looking for a new challenger",3

He finished his training (Semper Fi!) and was immediately given his first posting: he was going to Afghanistan. Being an FNG, the Devil Dog worked long and worked hard, but by the end of his tour, he felt he had earned the respect of those he served with. 

When he rotated back to the States, his handler asked what he wanted to do next, and bless his soul, our Marine says he wants nothing more than to go right back to Afghanistan, he doesn’t feel right leaving his squad behind. His handler looks at him like he’s a bit off, but hey, if he wants to go back, that’s up to him. Our Marine now has experience, and a brand-new promotion. He now shows the new boys the ropes, and helps the LT not get his head blown off. A near-miss has him out of commission for a bit, but he refuses to leave the country, he cares too much for his team. 

Finally, another promotion and several medals later, his second tour is up. He rotates back to the States and meets his handler again. He’s been offered a training billet, passing on his lessons to new Marines. He’s been offered to become an Officer and lead other Marines, but our Marine won’t have it, he wants right back to Afghanistan. His handler tries convincing him that two tours is more than enough, but if our Marine has learned one thing, it’s persistence. Eventually his handler gives up, and the Devil Dog starts his third Afghan tour. 

This tour is both harder and easier. On the one hand, he knows all the tricks, and is really in the groove. On the other hand, he’s seen too many of his friends get hurt or killed, and he knows that he’s one lucky sonuvabitch. But our Marine won’t let something small like fear get in his way, he shits hand grenades and pisses napalm! Fear is for pussies! And so, he begins his third tour. His name is starting to become known in the region, as someone the Afghanis can trust and someone the Taliban know to be wary of. Wherever he goes, his sector is quiet. He takes the new Marines on their first tour under his wing, mentoring them and helping them make it home alive. 

Back in the states, his name is spreading through the Corps. Promotions and medals are bestowed upon our Marine, but that doesn’t matter to him. He’s got a mission, and by God Almighty he’s going to fulfill it. His third tour ends, and he’s back in front of his handler. Higher ups are insistent that he take up a training position, but the Devil Dog won’t have it. He wants back to Afghanistan. It doesn’t matter what anyone says, even when the Marine Commandant himself drops by to talk with him. Finally, exasperated, the Commandant wants to know why this exemplary Marine hasn’t changed his posting to Afghanistan once since his enlistment. “Well sir,” says the Marine, “reposting is all I really know”.","A teenager was standing in front of a recruiter, about to sign his life away to the Marines.",33

After finishing his daily lunch of cheetos and dew he looks over the pc pool to see a bald man sitting at a library pc, staring intently at the screen while simultaneously fiddling with the PC. Suspecting something, the admin moves over behind the man to check on what he is doing. He realizes all the bald man is doing is pressing the power button over and over again until the boot logo appears on the screen, only to turn it back off.

Baffled, the admin asks the man what he is doing. The bald man turns around in his chair and smiles at him. The admin realizes he is a Buddhist monk and a feeling of déjà vu dawns on the admin.

""Oh, no thanks."" The woman says again and walks away, leaving the vendor upset.

The next day the lady comes back and just as the vendor predicted, she asks again and this continues for the next couple days and each day, the vendor becomes more and more frustrated with the woman.

She expressed her feelings to her husband and on the day before his departure, he went to the local sex toy shop to attempt to find her a method of sustenance for the following six months.

When he entered, the shop was completely empty, except for one shop assistant. He approached the shop assistant and asked whether there was something *really special* that he could give her wife while he was away. The shop assistant thought for a moment, before leading the man into the back of the shop to an ancient, hand carved, wooden case. He gently lifted the lid and revealed what seemed to be a wooden dildo. 

The man was irritated. ""This isn't enough! You said you'd find something special!""

The shop assistant remained calm and told him: ""This isn't a normal dildo. This is a voodoo dildo. Watch.""

He lifted out the dildo and exclaimed: ""**Voodoo dildo, the keyhole!**""

The dildo immediately, of its own volition, starting fucking the keyhole on the door. The man was amazed and bought it instantly, bringing home to his wife that evening.

When he brought it to his wife, she was astounded when he showed her. 

""Look: **Voodoo dildo, the keyhole!**"" It had the same effect. 

""Wow!"" She said, thoroughly impressed, and thanked him.

The next day, the man had left, so she thought she'd have some time to herself. She took out this dildo and shouted: ""**Voodoo dildo, my vagina!**""
It set to work.

About ten minutes later, she was having the time of her life. Suddenly, she realised that she didn't know how to make it stop. She tried many different ways, but it would not stop.

""There's only one way"" she said. ""I need to go to the hospital.""

She struggled into her car, and with great difficulty, started to drive down the nearest motorway to the hospital. Now, as of course you'd expect, it was hard for her to operate a car whilst having a long wooden rod move in and out of her at great speed. One accidental turn took her off course and she crashed violently into a tree.

About 15 minutes later, the police arrived and asked her what had happened. She explained the whole story of the dildo, having to get to the hospital and why she needed help - yet, the didn't seem to believe her.

One policeman looked at her and shook his head. 
His disbelief caused his downfall:
_**""Voodoo dildo, my ass.""**_

The manager is approached by the local business community and the monk is asked to explain his motives at a press conference.

He says “As a young man I followed the ways of Buddha and sought enlightenment. I travelled deep into the mountains of the Himalayas and joined a secret temple where I toiled and meditated, after many long years I was able to enter a state of trance for several hours at a time. I toiled and meditated until I was able to enter a state of trance for two days at a time. At this point I had proceeded to the most sacred of our shrines where the oldest monks sat for days, even weeks at a time as they reached a state of trance so sublime, so enlightened that it was said they would become so one with existence that their physical form would wink out leaving only their essence. Scribes sat silent in the temple waiting for such an eventuality so that the last truth imparted by one so enlightened could be taken down and preserved.

One day it happened, I was jolted from my meditation as the scribes rushed to an ancient monk, I half heard his words of enlightenment before his physical form vanished. Afterwards myself and other monks who were present discussed what we had heard but we were unable to agree on his final word.

Eventually our differences were too great, we could not agree and left the monastery to find enlightenment in our own ways.  And that brought me here to this job.”

“So what was the truth that the monk gave?” asked a reporter.

“The best way to get karma,” said the monk, “is reposing.”",A Buddhist monk works for a large department store on the window displays.,5

So she goes to her mother, she says what am I going to do I’m so big down there when I marry Harry he’s going to divorce me.

Her mother says don’t worry sweetheart it runs in the family, do what I did when I married your father. Go to the market, get some raw liver, put it in there he’ll never know the difference.

So she does.

They have eight hours of sex after their marriage. She wakes up at 10 o’clock, he’s gone but there’s a note on her pillow. 
It says -:
“My darling Harriet.
To think that I waited a year to consummate our loving relationship makes my heart beat so loudly I’m surprised it didn’t wake you up.
The only reason I’m not here now darling is that I’m at work to make enough money to buy you a house, a picket fence, we’ll have dogs and children.

When the 5 o’clock dinner bell rings I will be home like the winged Gossamer of love in your arms.

Your loving husband, Harry.

One day, sick of her nagging, he answered a help wanted ad.

“So you think you have what it takes to be a Repo man, Todd?” the interviewer asked.

“Sure, man. I got this.”

But Todd didn’t get it. He was really bad. He kept getting shot at by angry owners, chased by dogs... he even grabbing the wrong vehicle more than once! His mom wouldn’t let him forget it either.

“If you don’t figure this out, you’re on the street, Todd!” she yelled at him.

So Todd went in to work the next day, and told his boss how bad things looked. His boss was a pretty understanding guy, all things considered, and said, “Todd, I like you. I’m going to help you out. If you want get better at this, you need to talk to The Man. I’ll set it up on your next job.”

So Todd went to the address his boss wrote down, and waited by the car he was supposed to repossess. After about an hour, The Police showed up - and I don’t mean the boys in blue - I mean Sting, Stewart and Andy. 

Let me tell you, if you think those guys could rock on stage, you should see what they can do to a late model Corolla behind on its payments! Faster than you could say “Roxanne,” that car was open, fired up, and out of there! 

Todd was blown away by their skills for the rest of that week. They taught him everything! And NO ONE was better than Sting (of course!). He showed Todd a million tricks, and before he knew it, Todd was the lead repo dude at the office.

After an especially lucrative week, he brought home a new 72” flatscreen and gave it to his mother. She was absolutely floored. 

“How did you do this, Todd!?” she exclaimed, “How did you become so successful?”

“A lot of hard work,” he replied, “ and I had great teachers! They were amazing - especially the leader! It’s true…

Suddenly, a shorter, poorly dressed man appeared in his path. He desperately needed a shave and his eyes seemed to bug out. 

""Sir! May I please look at your socks?"" The man inquired frantically. ""It is of utmost importance.""

The gentleman was taken aback. ""My socks? Who are you? What do you want?""

""Please! Just let me see your socks! There's no time for questions!""

Not really in a hurry, the gentleman decided to comply, so that perhaps the man would leave him alone. He reached down and pull up the legs of his pants enough to reveal his socks. Only then did he notice that one was black and the other was a dark shade of gray. 

""Aha! Yes!"" Cried the strange man. ""You are the one the prophecy spoke of.""

""What? Prophecy?""

""No time! We must travel to Italy.""

""Uh...""

""Money is of no concern. Just come with me on a plane flight. You and I are going to change the world.""

""You're insane. Goodbye."" 

""Wait! You are getting paid for this in the billions!""

That got the gentleman's attention. One thing led to another, and the two mem were in Italy. The strange man led him to a huge monestary. There they found a monk watering a flower garden.

""Go to that monk. Offer him a million dollars as payment for his garden.

""Uh...""

""Just do it! Go!""

So the gentleman did it. He was quite rich, after all. It wasn't difficult to persuade the monk to part with his plants.

""Ok,"" said the strange man. ""Now we go to Germany.""

""But...""

""Millions of dollars!""

So the duo flew to Germany. The strange man was apparently quite wealthy as well, as he played for the flights. Once again, they found a monk tending a garden full of daisies, and once again the gentleman bought the garden for one mil. 

They did the same at monestaries in France, Russia, and Romania.

At last, the strange man flew the gentleman back to the States and gave him a case of five billion dollars.

""Thank you so much,"" said the strange man. ""You saved us all. Please accept this money as the gratitude of the world. 

The gentleman was confused. ""All I did was buy a bunch of gardens. What exactly did we accomplish?""

The strange man put his hand on the gentleman's shoulder. ""Don't you see? It's what the prophecy says. Only you, sir, could prevent florist friars.""",A very rich American gentleman...,23

On his first day, the aged Abbott takes him on a tour of the monastery.  The young novice is shown to the cells where the monks sleep, the chapel where the monks pray, the mess hall where they eat.  Finally, the Abbott takes the new recruit to see the Scriptorium, where the monks copy and illuminate important texts.  After watching the monks for a few moments, the young man asks the Abbott a question.

“Father, do these monks always copy from copies, rather than originals?”

“Yes my son.  That is what we have done for centuries.”

“But, if a monk ever made a mistake, that error would be passed down in copy after copy after copy and you’d never discover the mistake!”

Thinking for a moment, the Abbott nods sagely. “There is truth in what you say, hound novice!  I believe you will do well here.”

That night, no one could find the Abbott.  Monks searched the cells, the chapel, the mess hall.  Finally, the young novice went to the scriptorium.  There he found the Abbott in tears, holding an ancient copy of the rules of the order.

“Father!  What’s wrong?  Why are you weeping?”

Looking up through tear streaked eyes, the Abbott replied:

“The word is ‘Celebrate.’”",First Day in the Monastery,10

""Looks more like a stockbroker to me."" argued the second. They continued to debate the subject for a good while until eventually the first builder needed to use the toilet. On walking in, he saw the smartly dressed man standing at a urinal.

""Excuse me mate, but me and my friend have been arguing over what a smartly dressed fella like you does for a living?"" the builder said to the man.

Smiling the man replied, ""I'm a logical scientist.""

""A what?"" asked the builder.

A bit puzzled, but intrigued the builder decided to play along, ""Yes, I do as it happens.""

""Well then it's logical to assume that you either keep it in a bowl or a pond. Which is it?""

""A pond"" the builder replied.

""Well then it's logical to assume that you have a large garden."" The builder nodded his agreement. So the man continued, ""which means it's logical to assume you have a large house.""

""I have a 6 bedroom house that I built myself."" the builder said proudly.

""Given that you have such a large house, it's logical to assume that you are married...""

The builder nodded again, ""Yes, I'm married and we have three children.""

""Then it's logical to assume that you have a healthy sex life.""

""Five nights a week!"" the builder boasted.

The man smiled a little, ""Therefore it's logical to assume you don't masturbate often.""

""Never!"" the builder exclaimed.

""Well there you have it"" the man explained, ""That's logical science at work. From finding out that you have a goldfish, I've discovered the size of your garden, all about your house, your family and your sex life!""

The rep gets back on the line and says: ""I went through your usage reports. It seems over 90% of your bandwidth is coming from a single website."" The brunette gets the url of the website and goes to take a look. It's a very old looking website that seems like it was made in '91, but she pokes around in the source anyways. She notices something inexplicable and checks the Whois page. It looks like the owner lives only a block down! She decides to go meet the owner and takes the walk to his door.

Knock-knock, knock-knock. Knock-knock, knock-knock. Knock-knock, knock-knock. The brunette waits.

Finally, the door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the woman says, “but are you the owner of this website?”

“Ah, my old blog. Thank you so much for visiting it, I greatly appreciate anybody who would read the musings of an old man. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says the woman, “a script is making the same request thousands of times per second! It's made my internet bill huge and it has to be so expensive to host! Your developer must have been an imbecile!”

“But that is my intention, dear woman,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, re-POSTing is the best way to get karma.”
