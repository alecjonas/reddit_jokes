It’s a very special watch. It has been in my family for six generations,” he said. He began to swing the watch gently back and forth, while quietly chanting, “Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch…” The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch. 

Suddenly, it slipped from the hypnotist’s fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. “Shit,” said the hypnotist. 

It took three weeks to clean up the theatre

And God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep the figure that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat, and sugar from the cane and combined them. And Woman went from size 6 to size 14. So God said, ""Try my fresh green salad.""

And Satan presented Ranch Dressing, buttery croutons and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast. God then said, ""I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them."" And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof. God then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it ""Angel Food Cake,"" and said, ""It is good.""

Satan then created chocolate cake and named it ""Devil's Food."" God then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before the flickering blue light and gained pounds. 

Then God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition. And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fried them. And Man gained pounds. God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then said, ""You want fries with that?"" And Man replied, ""Yes! And super size them!"" And Satan said, ""It is good.""

One says... 

""I have an idea! We hold a raffle and sell the tickets for mere rupees, that way every Indian no matter how poor can enter, millions of Indians all buying tickets, it will be a huge step in the right direction"".

It was agreed amongst the group that this was by far the best idea to see great financial gains over the shortest time frame and took the idea to the government.

The government loved it and began the raffle as soon as they could.
After a year of selling millions and millions of raffle tickets it was time to draw. A stage was built, loud speakers lined the streets of New Dehli and radio broadcasters had come from all over the country. One of India's most beautiful women was hired to reach in to the mountainous barrel to pluck the lucky winners tickets.

She reaches in and grabs the first one, hands it to the Prime Minister...

""Ticket number one million seven hundred and three thousand and twenty six"" could be heard booming through the speakers in the streets.

""IT'S ME"" yells a little old man right towards the back. 
He runs for an hour to get to the stage to claim his prize.

""it's me, it's me, see look at my ticket, I won I won, I can't believe it, I've won"" he cries.

""Yes you have won, and what a prize"" says the Prime minister. ""You have won a year long vacation for you and your immediate family, sailing around the world, first class on the most elegant ships, all expenses paid""

""Oooh I can't belive it"" sobs the little old man.

The beautiful woman reaches in to the barrel again.

""It is ticket two hundred and eleven"" says the Prime Minister.

""IT'S ME"" yells a man in the middle of the crowds. ""IT'S ME, IT'S ME, I'VE WON"" he cries in disbelief.

He races to the stage

""it's me it's me. I've won I've won"" he can be heard chanting ""oh my, what have I won?"" he asks the Prime minister.

""a fruit cake""

""WHAAAT.... A FRUIT CAKE!"" yells the Indian man angrily. 

""A fruit cake? But third prize was an all expenses paid holiday for a year and I get a fruit cake?""

""Ahhh"" says the prime minister. ""This is a special fruit cake, it was baked by Madame Gandhi""

""FUCK MADAME GANDHI""

This would have been the largest single shipment of  mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico.

But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank.
 
The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning.

Every weekend Ron would rent a cabin for the weekend.  The routine was pretty much the same, he would come in Friday night to check in and be out on the lake fishing before dawn and stay out until after sunset.

One day Ron calls for his reservation but wants to upgrade because he just got married and they are going to spend their honeymoon at the cabins.  Since he has been a regular customer for years we go out of our way to add some special touches to the cabin for the occasion.

Friday night rolls around and he checks in like always.  The next morning just before dawn I see him loading his boat with a full day's provisions but I don't see the new wife.  

Ron was not the easiest guy to talk to, but I was curious as to why he would be fishing alone on his honeymoon.  So I said ""Hi Ron.  Surprised to see you out here today.  Thought you would be in bed tearing it up"".

Ron responds ""Nope.  She's got a bout of the chlamydia."". 

Kinda shocked by his openess, I say ""Well, there is always the back door until it clears up I guess"".

Ron says, ""Nope.  She's got the gonorrhea back there"".

Now feeling really awkward I say ""Well, I guess there is always a BJ"".  

He reponds ""Nope.  She has the herpes on her mouth.  Don't want no sores.""

Without thinking I blurt out ""Dude, why on Earth did you marry this girl?

Ron grins and says,"" Well, she has worms too and you know how I love to fish""",The Honeymoon,0

post,3uftc7,2qh72,jokes,false,1448606832,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3uftc7/edward_and_tobias/,self.jokes,,"A farmer had a decent racing horse that one day had twins. He called the twins Edward and Tobias. The colts were incredibly healthy and competitive, from a young age they would run together. Whenever the farmer would lay out some new hay or corn feed, the two colts would race, pushing each other as hard as they could to see who would win. Tobias always won, but it was always a close race. The farmer, noticing how competitive they were, decided to enter them in a racing competition. 

Their first race both horses were very excited. Ed said to Tobias “Good luck, may the best horse win.” Tobias responded “Same to you, let’s beat these other guys!” 

Well the race started and Tobias and Edward took off, taking an early lead. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. The other horses were completely destroyed in comparison. 

“Good race!” Edward told Tobias, and Tobias agreed. 

The farmer realized that he had made bank, that somehow he found two golden tickets. He entered the horses into many other local competitions and every time his horses would destroy the other horses. It always ended with Tobias barely beating Edward. 

Eventually the two horses found themselves in a larger arena. They were at the state fair. Edward turned to Tobias and said “I’ll get you this time!” Tobias responded “Meh, I don’t actually care if you or I win, so long as we beat these other idiots!” Another horse snorts Edward said, “Good luck!” Tobias responded “You have good luck too!” 

The race started and Tobias and Edward took out of the gates. It was a tough race; the other horses were able to keep up with Edward and Tobias for the first lap. But the two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. By now they had a lead over the other horses. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. 

Panting, Edward congratulated Tobias. 

A few years went by and now Edward and Tobias were professional race horses. Their competition put them in the spot light of many the newspaper. Ever was Tobias the main headline though. Even as they got older, Tobias would always beat Edward. 

One day they found themselves in the Kentucky Derby. In the starting gates, Edward turned to Tobias and said “I will get you this time, I know it! This is the race, here, in front of all these people.” Tobias responded “We’ll see brother, first we have to beat these other horses. None of them are poor runners either.” “Agreed,” Edward responded, “But it would be nice to beat you just once.” “You’ve always been the one who pushed me so hard.” Tobias responded. Edward said back, “And you’re the reason I’ve always worked so hard too.” Another horse vomited in its starting gate. 

The gun went off, the gates opened up. Tobias and Edward took off. They were trailing the leaders, but didn’t seem to mind, they were in their own world. The two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. By now they had caught up with the other horses. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. It finished with Tobias in first and Edward a very, very close second with another horse right behind him. It was such a close race it came down to verifying with a photograph. Edward turned to Tobias, “I can’t believe you beat me, I tried so hard. Still, we just won the Kentucky Derby!!” 

Years later, after living luxurious lives where they were pampered by the farmer who found them and long after they were retired, Tobias turned to Edward and said. “Do you want to have one final race, for old time’s sake?” Edward responded, “I never could beat you, I always wanted to have a chance to do so, just to know what it feels like to win.” Tobias said “Tell you what, why don’t we have a race? Just like back when we were colts; let’s run to that feed mill over there and back to this fence three times.” Edward said “I don’t think I could take loosing again, after all this time, coming in second. I don’t know if I would want to live after another loss. I don’t have that much life in me any more.” Tobias said, “Tell you what, if it comes down to it, if it is really close, I’ll let you win. Just so you can know what it feels like. Yeah, it won’t be ‘real’ but you’ll get to know.” Edward agreed. 

“Ready, set, GO!” And both horses were off. The two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. It was almost as though the two old horses had the vitality of their youth again. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead again. On the third and final lap, close to finish, Edward was leading. It looked like he had the race in the bag. But suddenly Tobias seemed to get another final wind and he pushed ahead. He beat Edward. Tobias started prancing, victoriously, Edward, his soul crushed, lay down on the ground. 

The old farmer’s dog, who had known both horses since their infancy, came up to Tobias and said, “Tobias, why would you do that? Why would you crush your brother’s hopes and dreams like that? There was nothing riding on this race, no point. Why? Why? Why would you do that?” 

Upon hearing the dog, Edward stood up, he looked at his brother and said “Holy Shit, Toby, a talking dog!”",Edward and Tobias,1

The cashier says ""How about 25 thousand?"" 
The guy pays accordingly and walks out with Michael Jackson's brain.
The second guy sees Stephen Hawking's brain on the shelf and asks the cashier how much it will be.
The cashier says ""Mmmm. How about 60 thousand?""
The guy produces 600 bills (Hammerspace exists here too, ok? ;D) and walks out with Stephen Hawking's brain.
The third guy sees Donald Trump's brain on the shelf and asks ""Hey, I see Donald Trump's brain up here. How much for that?""
The cashier replies ""Oh, that'll be only 6 billion dollars""
The guy, knowing his hammerspace can't hold that much money, utters in disbelief ""What!? There's... there's no way that can be right!""

The rancher's prize bull was missing from the section through which the railroad passed. The rancher only wanted to be paid the fair value of the bull.

The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the back room of the general store.

The attorney for the railroad immediately cornered the rancher and tried to get him to settle out of court. The lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking.

After the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, ""You know, I hate to tell you this, old man, but I put one over on you in there. I couldn't have won the case. The engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the stand.

The banana replies ""i cant take it people just want to peel my skin and eat me or put me in a blender to make me a smoothie. I cant take the stress and just wabt to die please!"" The judge agrees and grants him death.

The judge moves on to the cucumber and asks why his life is so bad that he wants to end it. ""Your honor all people ever want to do to me is cut me up, make me bath in ranch dressing and eat me. I cant take i want to die you honor"". The judge agrees again and grants the cucumbers wish for death.

Then in comes the dick. The judge says theres no way his life could be as bad as the banana and the cucumber so it will be hard to convince him to let the dick die and asks him why. ""Well first off your honor my neighbor is an asshole and people keep putting me in a dark hole and make me do push ups until i throw up""

post,3udxns,2qh72,jokes,false,1448569493,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3udxns/nerds/,self.jokes,,"A truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar he sees a big sign on the door saying ""Nerds Not Allowed - Enter At Your Own Risk!"" He goes in and sits down. 

The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, says, ""You smell kind of nerdy. What do you do for a living?"" 

The truck driver says, ""I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I am hauling."" 

The bartender says, ""Okay, truck drivers are not nerds."" and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. 

The truck driver said, totally shocked, ""Why did you do that?"" 

The bartender said, ""Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don't even need a license."" 

The truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers. They are all engineers, accountants and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. 

He can't let them steal his whole load. So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop. 

The truck driver said, ""What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season."" 

""Well, sure,"" said the patrolman. ""But you can't bait 'em.""

People with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming off of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cannot be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean quality assurance checks must be smartly distributed across the production line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket won’t get frustrated and purchase another product instead.

Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory gathered the top people in the company together. Since their own engineering department was already stretched too thin, they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem.

The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP (request for proposal), third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later a fantastic solution was delivered — on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. The problem was solved by using high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box off the line, then press another button to re-start the line.

A short time later, the CEO decided to have a look at the ROI (return on investment) of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. There were very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. “That was some money well spent!” he said, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.

The number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. How could that be? It should have been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers indicated the statistics were indeed correct. The scales were NOT picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.

Perplexed, the CEO traveled down to the factory and walked up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before the scale, a $20 desk fan was blowing any empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. Puzzled, the CEO turned to one of the workers who stated, “Oh, that…One of the guys put it there ’cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang!""",A toothpaste factory had a problem...,6

post,3uc1h0,2qh72,jokes,false,1448534624,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3uc1h0/real_rabbi_joke/,self.jokes,,"OK - so many years ago, i was actually a practicing jew, in a yeshiva no less. The rabbi's would sometimes tell us jokes. most were awful. this one i thought was amusing. in a reddit filled with old reposts, i think it'll at least be a bit fresh.

A long time ago there was a small jewish community is a very anti-semitic christian european town. The anti-semitism reached such a fever pitch that the christian community members wanted to run the jews out of town, but the local bishop, who was effectively the mayor, had the last say.

""We cannot simply run them out of town"", he said, ""without at least giving them a chance to defend themselves. Let them know that one week from this Sunday, in the town square, I will personally challenge a champion of their choosing to a battle of spiritual purity. It will be a silent battle of the wits. If they lose, they must leave the town. But if I am bested, they may stay.""

So word reached back into the synagogue, and they were all veklempt. ""Who are we gonna send??"" They had no idea what they were in for, but finally, good old Shmueli volunteered. The congregation was anxious, but hopeful that somehow shmueli could save them.

The next sunday, with much pomp and circumstance the bishop and shmueli faced off in the town square. After staring at each other for a few moments, the Cardinal rapidly lifted up one finger into the air and held it - the challenge had begun.

Shmueli, with a stern look on his face, quickly raised two fingers in the air.

The bishop lowered his hand, and nodded.. impressed at the prowess of his competitor.

Then the bishop lifted up his hand above his head - palm open and fingers spread apart.

The crowd gasped as Shmuelli responded by making a firm first held close to his heart.

Again, the bishop nodded- somewhat surprised at the response. This 'shmueli' was a worthy adversary.

Finally the bishop motioned to an assistant and whispered in his ear. Moments later, the assistant handed the bishop a bottle of red wine. The bishop showed this off to the crowd who murmured in confusion.

At this, shmueli motioned to his friend yitzchak, and with a few quiet words, moments later yitzchak handed shmueli a wheel of white cheese, which he held aloft.

At this, the bishop bowed his head, and said quietly, ""the battle is over. Shmeuli has bested me. The jews may stay.""

The jews cheered and danced all the way back to the synagogue, carrying shmueli on their shoulders. 

When they had all gone, all that was left were the christian community members, standing around the bishop in stunned silence. Finally, one asked: ""Bishop, what happened? we didn't understand the battle. How did he beat you?""

The bishop responded, ""ah.. shmueli is a wise man. At first i lifted up one finger to say that there is only one god, and that is the lord - to which shmueli responded with two fingers.. saying yes, but the lord can be worshipped in more than one way.""

""then i lifted up my hand, fingers spread out, to say - the jewish people are scattered and formless across the earth! Without a homeland or center - vagrants and vagabonds!""

To this, shmueli held a fist over his heart - saying that above all else, the jewish people are united with one heart - and that overcomes and separation in the world.""

Finally, was my last and most brutal accusation - with the bottle of wine i said that the jews' sins are as red as the wine i hold - a simple fact to which i can accept no denial.

And to this, shmueli responded with a wheel of white cheese. Saying yes, but through devotion and love of god, our sins may be transmuted into purity and light.""

The crowd was awed. This champion of the jews had earned his victory. They all slowly shuffled off to their homes.

Meanwhile... back int he synagogue..

""Hey shmueli!!"" said avram.. ""what the heck was dat all about!?""

""Well"", said shmueli..""it was really pretty straight forward. First he lifts up a finger like he's a'gonna poke my eye out.. so i says, 'you poke MY eye out, im gonna poke BOTH you eyes out!'

Then he lifts his hand like he's gonna give me a smack.. so i says with my fist 'watch out or i'll clock you one too!'

Finally, i guess he felt bad and wanted to make nice and have a party. So i said sure!! you bring the wine, i'll bring the cheese!

To he first he said “what was your biggest sin on earth?” and the man replied “Oh man I just love alcohol and being drunk man” so the devil showed the man to a room full of alcohol of every type and description and he put the man inside and said “see you in 100 years” and locked the door.

To the second man he asked the same question and the man replied “oh man I just love to have sex with the ladies, I was really unfaithful to my wife man”. So the devil took the man and showed him to a room full of hundreds upon thousands of gorgeous and beautiful naked women. The man ran inside and the devil said “see you in 100 years” and locked the door.

The third man’s answer to the question was “oh man I just LOVE weed! I’m high all the time man and I can’t live without it!”. The devil showed the man to a room packed with the most amazing grade-A bud you’ve ever seen, stacked to the roof! The man went inside and the devil locked the door after saying “see you in 100 years”.

100 years later the devil came by to let the three men out. He opened the door to the first man’s room and found the man collapsed on the ground, passed out with empty bottles laying around him and puke all over him. He was a mess.
The devil opened the 2nd man’s door and the man came running out of the room and cried “IM GAY! IM GAY!”. Finally the devil came to the third man’s room and opened the door. Sitting in the middle of all the bud, in the exact same position the devil had left him in was the man. He looked up at the devil and with a single tear rolling down his cheek he asked ; “hey man, got a light?”

The bartender raises his eyebrows, but serves the man three beers, which he drinks quietly at a table, alone.
An hour later, the man has finished the three beers and orders three more. This happens yet again. The next evening the man again orders and drinks three beers at a time, several times. Soon the entire town is whispering about the Man Who Orders Three Beers.
Finally, a week later, the bartender broaches the subject on behalf of the town. ""I don't mean to pry, but folks around here are wondering why you always order three beers.""
""'Tis odd, isn't it?"" the man replies. ""You see, I have two brothers, and one went to America, and the other to Australia. We promised each other that we would always order an extra two beers whenever we drank as a way of keeping up the family bond.""
The bartender and the whole town was pleased with this answer, and soon the Man Who Orders Three Beers became a local celebrity and source of pride to the hamlet, even to the extent that out-of-towners would come to watch him drink.
Then, one day, the man comes in and orders only two beers. The bartender pours them with a heavy heart. This continues for the rest of the evening -- he orders only two beers. Word flies around town. Prayers are offered for the soul of one of the brothers.
The next day, the bartender says to the man, ""Folks around here, me first of all, want to offer condolences to you for the death of your brother. You know -- the two beers and all...""
The man ponders this for a moment, then replies, ""You'll be happy to hear that my two brothers are alive and well. It's just that I, myself, have decided to give up drinking for Lent.""

The middle son looks back to her tiny, rickety car that she doesn’t use due to safety concerns, and decides to get her an expensive, comfortable, safe car. 
The youngest son remembers her love for reading Bible verses but her failing eyesight, so he gets her a costly parrot that had been training for years to memorize and say many Bible verses. 
Their gifts are given, and soon the grandmother sends out thank you letters to each one of them. 
To the eldest son: Thank you for the gigantic house you gave to me. It must have taken a lot of money. Honestly, I don’t know what I’ll do, as one person, in such a big house. The challenge of moving is something I don’t want to face either. I’m not quite sure how to accept your gift, but thanks.
To the middle: Thank you for the car you’ve given me. It was very thoughtful of you. I’m sorry to say that I feel like I won’t be able to use it much, due to my failing eyesight and the fact that the only place I need to travel to would be the supermarket, a block away.

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.
Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.
But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.,2330

A large blue puff of smoke catches their attention, and they see a genie appear before them. The genie, feeling generous, decides to give both of them three wishes.

The genie first turns to the bear and says ""What is your wish bear?"" The bear, feeling a bit skeptical, wishes for an extremely sexy female bear. The genie claps his hands and *poof!*, a bear who happened to be walking nearby turned into the most attractive female bear he had ever seen.

The genie then turned to the rabbit and said ""Okay rabbit, what is your first wish?"" The rabbit, without hesitation, says ""I wish for a helmet!"", and with a clap of his hands the genie makes a helmet appear, which the rabbit puts on his head.

The bear, realizing again how much he hates the rabbit, is blown away at this waste of a wish. How stupid do you have to be to wish for a helmet, when you can wish for ANYTHING in the world? 

The genie then asks the bear ""Okay bear, what is your second wish?"" The bear thinks for a moment and says, ""I wish that all of the bears in this forest were super attractive female bears!"" The genie claps his hands and assures the bear that it is done.

The genie then asks the rabbit for his second wish. ""I wish for a motorcycle!"" the rabbit says. The genie clapped his hands and  a motorcycle appears.

The bear is now totally blown away that the rabbit has wasted two of his wishes on such stupid things. ""I freaking hate that rabbit!"" he thinks to himself.

The genie then asks ""Okay bear, what is your final wish?"" The bear thinks long and hard, and then making up his mind he says: ""Okay okay, I wish all of the other bears in the WORLD were super hot female bears!"" The genie claps his hands and assures the bear it is done.

The rabbit, who is now wearing his new helmet and revving the engine of his new motorcycle, then gets asked for his final wish. Rabbit looks at the bear and gives him a nasty grin and yells: ""I wish the bear was GAY!"", and then drives off.

Eventually, Archangel Michael found him on the seventh day resting. He enquired of God, 'Where have you been?' 
 
God pointed downwards through the clouds. Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, 'What is it?' 
 
'It's a planet,' replied God, 'and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.' 
 
'Balance?' inquired Michael, still confused. 
 
God explained, pointing down to different parts of the Earth. 'For example, North America will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while South America is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot, and Russia will be a cold spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people.' 
 
God continued, pointing to the different countries. 
 
This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.' 
 
The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to another area of land and asked, 'What's that?' 
 
'Ah,' said God. That's the North of England, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful people, seven Premiership football teams in the North West alone, and many impressive cities; it is the home of the world's finest artists, musicians, writers, thinkers, explorers and politicians. The people from the North of England are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as speakers of truth.' 
 
Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed, 'What about balance God, you said there will be BALANCE!'
