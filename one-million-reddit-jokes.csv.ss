post,4rny8e,2qh72,jokes,false,1467888834,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4rny8e/not_having_sex_tonight/,self.jokes,,"One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, 'I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.'
I said, 'WHAT??!! What was that?!'
So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...
'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.'
She responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?'
Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.
The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.'
We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.
I think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.'
I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'
Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?'
I then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.'
And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?'

He quickly flashes a smile back at his friend and makes his way to a table.
The second man walks in, with both sunglasses and dog, doing his best to mimic the confidence his friend wielded.

""Umm, sorry but we do not allow pets here.""

After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.

With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:

- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priesr who went to see the world after taking his oath.,9

On the day of his birth, a great earthquake shook the entire city and everyone in the hospital died except for him. He spent the next 35 years of his life studying geotechnical engineering to improve the quality of essential buildings and hopefully decrease the intensity of earthquakes in the city.

economy of force must be exercised in other places.
Economy of force requires the acceptance of prudent risks in
selected areas to achieve superiority at the point of decision.
One account has it that Napoleon allowed a subordinate
to draw up a plan for the disposition of his troops.
Not knowing what the Emperor wanted, the subordinate 
distributed the forces equally in neat little groups
along the border. On seeing it Napolean remarked 
""Very pretty, but what do you expect them to do?
Collect customs duties?"". 

Napoleon never encamped or entrenched,
it was the general maxim of the war - 
- where is the enemy ? Let us go and fight him !

is estimated by multiplying the mass by the rapidity;

The Judge, would judge the deceased on if they were worthy enough to pass through the gates to be assessed for heaven, dropped down to hell for assessment or reincarnated if the Judge felt it fit best.


The Judge beckoned the first man forward and asked him how he died. The first man began...
""Well, I've been suspecting my wife of having an affair for the longest time now and I came home from work early to catch her in the act. I live on the 25th floor you see and when I got home I could tell something was up so I searched and searched and searched and finally found the guy that was doing my wife hanging from my balcony, trying to swing himself onto the 24th floors balcony. In a fit of rage I began stomping on his hands so he would lose his grip and he ended up plummeting to the ground. He did manage to land in some tree branches though so still in my moment of rage, I went and grabbed the fridge and threw it over the balcony... Due to the rage and stress of this, my heart gave out and here I am...""


The Judge took in the story - cross-checked the first mans file, taking note of a few things and then informed the man that what he did was pretty severe and that he wasn't going to allow him into Heaven for assessment due to it. He also informed the man that he was going to be sent to Hell for assessment but the most probable outcome would be reincarnation... With that the first man was gone.


The Judge beckoned the second man forward and asked him how he died. The second man began...
""Well, I live on the 26th floor and was doing some exercising on my balcony. Stupidly I slipped which ended up sending me over the balcony plunging. Somehow though, I managed to grab onto the railing of the balcony of what I presume was the 25th floor. I began to swing myself to try get onto the 24th floor balcony when some moron came running out and stomped on my hands until I fell. Luck was on my side again though because I ended up landing in some tree branches and not to my death. However that was short lived because next thing I know a fridge falls on top of me, crushing me instantly and here I am...""


The Judge took in the story - cross-checked the second mans file, taking note of a few things and then informed the man that he led a good life and that he was going to be allowed through the gates to Heaven for assessment or he could opt to be reincarnated as something of his choosing, so long as it was realistic/within the boundaries of the goodness/life he lived and wasn't outrageous or farfetched. The second man felt that he wasn't ready for Heaven/etc so he opted for reincarnation... With that the second man was gone.

post,4rkefe,2qh72,jokes,false,1467834716,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4rkefe/the_golden_monkey/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving in the country when his car runs out of gas. Fortunately, he's able to make it to a nearby farmhouse, and goes to ask the farmer for some gas.
""Gas? I have a can down in the cellar. Go in the back, undo the lock, open the trap door, go down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and you'll find it next to the cage. But whatever you do, *don't touch the golden monkey in the cage*!""

Thankful, the man proceeds into the back, undoes the lock, opens the trap door, goes down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and looks around the cellar. Sure enough, there's a gas can on the floor, next to a large cage containing a golden monkey. It sits on a stool, ignoring him as he retrieves the gas can and starts up the thirty-seven flights of stairs to his car.

The man fills up his tank, thanks the farmer, and goes to replace the gas can. He heads into the back, through the trap door, down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and sets down the can. The golden monkey pays him no mind, and he goes on his way.

Halfway up the stairs, the man stops. He turns around, goes back down eighteen flights of stairs, and goes to the cage. ""Hello?"" he says to the monkey. The golden monkey ignores him. Slowly, he reaches out, putting his hand through the bars. The monkey doesn't move. Gently, he touches the monkey on the arm.

The man recoils as the golden monkey goes wild. It starts screaming and thrashing, clawing at him through the cage. Panicked, the man turns to run, but as he does, he hears the monkey break the bars of its cage. He barrels up the thirty seven flights of stairs as fast as he can, hearing the monkey speed after him, roaring. He reaches the top and slams down the cellar door, locks it, and makes a mad dash for his car. Behind him, the cellar door shatters as the monkey rips through it. 

He manages to make it to his car and jumps inside, peeling out as fast as he can. The monkey is right behind him, and before he can get up to speed, it leaps onto the top of the car. Howling, screaming, it beats at the roof of the car. The man floors it and steers wildly, but the monkey will not be dislodged. With a roar, it punches a hole through the roof and peels back the metal. The man slams the breaks, but the monkey will not be dislodged. Crying, the man braces himself. The monkey reaches in and taps him on the shoulder. ""Tag, you're it!""",The Golden Monkey,1

post,4rkcsy,2qh72,jokes,false,1467834151,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4rkcsy/the_world_tour/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man and his wife had been wanting to go on a world tour for a long time, with the only thing preventing them from doing so being the wife's devotion to their cat, Mittens. She simply could not bear the thought of being away from Mittens for a couple of months while they go and visit all the places in the world that they hadn't seen before.

Being wealthy, the husband came up with a plan. He employed a butler and made sure that the good man was a cat lover and instructed him to spend as much time as possible with Mittens to gain its trust. James the butler soon settled into the household and despite quite obviously not being the most intelligent, he performed his duties very well and did his part to give Mittens lots of attention and treats so that before too long the cat was quite fond of him.

Eventually the husband approached his wife and broached the subject of the two of them going on their long awaited world tour. At first the wife wouldn't hear a word of it, but he kept pointing out to her how fond Mittens had become of James and how attentive he was to the cat and telling her that James could phone them every morning and evening with a report on Mittens' well-being. Eventually he wore her down and she agreed that they could go on the trip.

For weeks before they were due to set off the wife drove James crazy with lists of instructions on how he should take care of Mittens, with daily schedules, when and how she should receive her favourite treats, down to the last detail.

Finally the day of their departure arrived. Just before they were about to leave the husband called James aside and said to him: Now remember, James, madam is extremely fond of Mittens, so you must please do your utmost to keep Mittens safe and happy. But please, just in case - heaven forbid - Mittens does pass away while we are away - Mittens is quite an old kitty by now after all - please, please don't just phone us and tell us that Mittens has died, because it will be the end of our trip and ruin our holiday that I have waited for so long. Rather, what you must do when you phone is to say, ""Mittens is on the roof, and she won't come down"", then I will know what has happened and I will slowly over the next few days prepare my wife and try and finish off our holiday as quickly as possible without completely ruining it. Do you understand, James?

To the husband's huge relief James confirmed: Yes sir, I understand, if Mittens dies, I must phone and say ""Mittens is on the roof and she won't come down"", and you will know what's happened.

At long last they set off on their long awaited trip. They visited every place that they had ever only seen in movies and books and travelled from country to country, visiting all the tourist sites, throughout Europe, across the Middle East, throughout Asia; they even went on safari in Africa. They were having a wonderful time. Twice a day James would phone and confirm that all was well with Mittens and the wife found that despite all her fears she was actually enjoying the trip.

Until one morning, when the phone rang as usual. 

As usual the wife rushed to the phone to get the latest news of her beloved Mittens.

Sure enough, it was James calling, to tell her, ""Madam, your mother is on the roof and she won't come down.""

As fate would have it, the car in front of me stopped short and given I was looking down for that brief second, I ended up hitting it - startling me and causing me to drop my phone on the floor.

Getting my wits about me, I realized that I wasn't hurt as the airbags didn't even deploy so the damage must be minimal.  I then reached down to find my phone so if I had to call the police to come take a report, I could do so.

It was at that point that when I sat back up that I now see the driver's door swing open rather abruptly and I knew this wasn't going to be fun.  However what happened next, I truly did not expect.

A little man, maybe 4' tall pops out of the car door and is now directly facing me and he looks less than pleased, most likely because no-one wants to be in an accident - much less for the holiday weekend. 

Anyways I get out of my car ready to apologize and see the amount of damage I caused by my stupidity figuring we can swap info and be on our way.

However this man of small stature looks right up at me and yells in a rather angry tone:


""I'm not happy!""


Of which my FU occurs as I yell back:

""Then which one are you then?""

He didn’t have many animals, but he did have two he loved immensely: his dog Spot, and his prize winning race horse, the fastest horse ever to run in the Kentucky Derby, Bolt. One day, the farmer and Spot were in the stables to watch a mare give birth to Bolt’s child. But to their surprise, the mare gave birth to not one, but two, strong, healthy foals. The farmer named the first born Buck and the second Casper.

From the very beginning, Buck and Casper shared their father’s competitive spirit. Within seconds of both being born, Buck looks at Casper and says “Hey brother! Let’s see who can stand up first.” Casper agreed, “Challenge accepted.” Buck tried to stand first, got half-way erect, and then fell over. Next Casper tried to stand, made it all the way up, wobbled, and fell down. Spot and the farmer watched intently, as this continued back and forth for a couple minutes, each brother standing a little longer than the other, until eventually Buck stood up and remained standing. “I win!” exclaimed Buck. “You sure did,” Casper replied “but it was very close. I know I’ll win next time!”

Some time passes, and the farmer decides that Buck and Casper are now old enough to be let out of the stables and explore the farm. The farmer, Spot and all the other animals gather around to watch the two young horses get their first taste of the outdoors. As soon as the two foals exit the stables, Buck turns to Casper and says “You see that fence across the field? Let’s have a race! First one to the fence and back wins.” “You’re on!” Casper replies.

And so the two horses take off towards the fence. First, Buck takes the lead, then Casper pulls ahead, then Buck takes the lead again as they reach the fence. On the way back the two horses are neck-and-neck, Casper ahead one second, Buck the next. Casper gives his all and takes a slight lead. “I’m going to win” he excitedly thinks, but at the last second Buck has a burst of speed and pulls ahead by a foot, winning the race. “I win!” Buck neighs loudly. “You sure did brother,” Casper replies “but that was very close. I’ll win the next race, I just know it.”

Having witnessed their race, the farmer decides to enter them in the next local horse derby. The farmer and Spot sit in the stands, watching with anticipation as the horses line up, Buck and Casper next to each other in lanes 3 and 4. “This is it! This is the race I’m going to beat you!” Casper says to Buck. “Probably brother! You are very fast and trained very hard” Buck says in return. At the sound of the gunshot, Buck and Casper take off out of the gates. They very quickly get way ahead of the other horses, and the two brothers stay neck-and-neck. First buck is ahead by a few inches, then Casper gets the lead, then Buck again, then Casper; back-and-forth until it seems like Casper finally has the lead. “I got it this time!” Casper whinnies in excitement, but suddenly Buck is right there next to him, and before Casper could dig deep for a burst of speed, they cross the finish line, Buck just a few inches ahead. “Drat!” Casper says, a little upset. “That was so close! I could taste victory.” “It was a very good race brother!” Buck says, “I’m very proud of you, that was the closest we’ve ever been. I thought you had it for sure.”

A few years pass of Buck and Casper racing, training, and growing. Year after year the farmer enters them into the races, year after year the farmer and Spot watch, and year after year Buck wins by a hair, with Casper getting closer and closer with each race. Finally, Buck and Casper are so fast and so famous – The Twin Bolts, they’re called – that they both get invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. On the big day, the farmer and Spot watch from home on the TV as Buck and Casper wish each other luck, and go to their gates to await the race. The starting gun fires, and all the horses take off. This time it’s a very close race; all the horses stay tight in a pack for most of the track. But near the end, all the horses begin to tire and slow – all the horses except for Buck and Casper.

Casper manages to get a good lead, and he looks back to his brother and yells “I’m going to win this time, there’s nothing you can do!” But his cockiness got the better of him, and the farmer, Spot, and Buck all watched in horror as just before the finish line, Casper loses his footing and takes a terrible fall, knocking himself out.

After the race, Casper wakes up back home in the stables, Buck watching over him intently. “How do you feel Casper” Buck asks with concern, but Casper can think only of the race. “Did I win?” he asks. “Did I finally beat you?” Buck shakes his head solemnly “I’m afraid not brother. You stopped just in front of the finish line. The race was stopped because of your injury, but I was declared the winner since I was in second place.”

Casper is devastated by this news. “…but …I was going to win” he says sadly, trying to stand. But one of Casper’s front legs gives him a sharp pain, and he falls over. “Are you okay Casper?” Buck asks, concern heavy in his voice. “The vet said you broke your leg. You need to give it time to heal.”

And so he did, but time never fully healed his leg. For years, Casper stayed at the farm, limping as he tried to run, while Buck continued to win Derby after Derby, eventually breaking his father Bolt’s speed record and winning more Derbies than any other horse in memory. Spot would watch Casper from the porch, saddened by the state of the once proud equine.

Many years later, the farmer retires Buck from racing. The two horses, now old, spend most of their time in the stables, Casper always quiet and sad. One day, Buck turns to Casper and says “You know brother, I miss the old days when we would race side-by-side. What do you say to one last race, huh?” But Casper shakes his head and says “There’s no point. Even in my prime, I could never beat you. What chance do I have now that I am old and lame?” Saddened by his brother’s depression, Buck gets an idea. “You know what brother? You’re the reason I ran so fast. You inspired me, our whole lives, to push myself and be the best I could be. I always looked up to you.” This makes Casper a little happy, so Buck continues “I bet that you, my greatest inspiration, will beat me. There’s no way you’ll lose again, you’re too good”. “Alright,” Casper says, his spirits high for the first time in years “I’ll race you. To the fence and back, just like when we were kids. And this time I’ll win!”

As Buck and Casper exit the stables, Spot – now also very old – pads over to watch. The two horses start running, much slower than in previous years, but still with as much intensity as their younger selves would muster. Casper, his excitement allowing him to ignore his old injury, takes the lead. Buck, digging deep, catches up, and they continue neck-and-neck. On the final stretch, Casper pulls ahead. After so many years, he’d finally get to know what it felt like to be number one, first place, the winner. Casper had never felt more proud or excited than at this moment in his life. But just before as he reaches the barn, Buck bolts past him, winning by a hair. Casper is crushed.

Now Spot, who watched the young horses grow up from afar, gets angry at this. He walks up to Buck and growls “Why?! After all the years, after all your victories, why? You couldn’t let your brother have this one race? You just broke his heart!” To which Buck replies

“Holy shit, a talking dog!”

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......
But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",What was the seductive sound?,592

The next day, the same man on the bicycle passes through the border once again, with two bags. Again, the officer looks through them to find only sand. Another weird look, and the man passes through the border. 

The police officer isn't the smartest of people, realizing the man could have been smuggling something within the sand. 

Two days later, the same man passes on the bicycle, with two more bags of sand. The officer feels through the sand, finding just rocks this time. The officer is now just plainly weirded out but still lets him pass.

So he comes out of his apartment, this giant amorphous mass of vanilla pudding, and starts *wobbling* towards the pier. After a few minutes he figures that he'd get there faster if he went by taxi.
So he hails a cab, gets inside and starts going towards the pier. The ride is hell. As the driver accelerates, the poor pudding slams into the back seat; as the driver brakes, the pudding lunges forward; as the driver goes right, the pudding bashes into the left windshield and vice versa. Finally his torture ends and he arrives at the pier.
Completely dazed, he walks over the docks and falls into the ocean. The end.

*The worst joke on Earth, am I right? :D*

Okay, I'll tell you another one so you don't curse me for wasting your precious time. Here it goes:

On a luxurious ocean liner, a man looks at the wedding ring in his hand. Joy radiates within him; he knows he will finally propose the girl of his dreams. As he watches that precious little object in his palm, the ocean liner brakes - and the ring falls into the ocean.
The man is heartbroken. What will he do now? He spends the day anxiously waiting for the evening, pacing forward and back. Dinner finally arrives, and he and his chosen sit at a table. Nervously, he orders fish and his date follows suit. When the food finally arrives, he slices his meal open.

Something was glimmering inside the fish... Guess what?

post,4rj0cf,2qh72,jokes,false,1467818795,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4rj0cf/piano_player_wanted/,self.jokes,,"So a guy sees a sign in a lounge window that says, ""Piano Player Wanted"" He goes in and secures an audition. He sits at the piano with the manager sitting nearby and proceeds to play an absolutely beautiful song. 

The manager is overwhelmed and says, ""Wow! That was wonderful. What song is that?""

""It's my own composition."", replied the pianist. ""I call it *A Weasel Ate My Genitals*""

""Oh. Okay. Well, can I hear another one?""

""Sure!"", said the pianist and plays another stunning piece.

""Great!"", said the manager. ""What song is that/""

""*Shit in My Mouth. I Love It!*""

""Alright then.....I tell you what, I'll hire you to play but you can't tell people what the names of your songs are.""

The pianist agrees and they arrange for him to return that weekend.

Well it was about 9 o'clock on Saturday and the pianist was knocking them dead. People were amazed by his skill and the tip jar was filling and the manager was all smiles. There was an old man sitting nearby drinking a gin &amp; tonic and clearly enjoying the music. After a while he notices that the pianist's zipper is open and he's putting on more of a show than intended. During a break between songs he shuffles over to the piano and says to the pianist, ""Excuse me. Do you know your zipper is open and your dick is hanging out?""

""Know it! Hell, I WROTE it!""

She referred to her time as a U.S. Senator and how she had voted for every Native American issue that came to the floor of the Senate.

Although Hillary was vague about the details of her plans, she seemed most enthusiastic and spoke eloquently about her ideas for helping her “red sisters and brothers.”

At the conclusion of her speech, the Tribes presented Hillary with a plaque inscribed with her new Indian name, “Walking Eagle.” The proud Hillary then departed in her motorcade to a fundraiser, waving to the crowds.

A news reporter later asked the group of chiefs how they came to select the new name they had given to Hillary.

They explained that “Walking Eagle” is the name given to a bird so full of shit it can no longer fly.

A couple are in bed and in the middle of the night she wakes up and gets to thinking and now can't sleep. Her husband turns over and she figures he's awake too so she decides to talk to him about stuff on her mind.

So she shakes him, and asks, ""if I die do you think you'll remarry?""

The poor guy is actually dead asleep, but wakes up and half halfheartedly says, ""what, oh yea sure."" He begins to snore.

Now her mind is racing at this, so she wakes him again asking, ""if I die and you remarry will you sleep with her in this bed?""  Now he's a little more awake and mutters, ""yea sure, its a good bed, I'm going back to sleep.""

Her mind is freaking out about this and pokes him awake again asking, ""if I die and you remarry will you sleep with her in this bed in these sheets?"" He's even more awake now a bit irritated, and says, ""yea sure, its a good bed, nice sheets, nothing wrong with it, going to sleep now.""

She can't believe it, after all these years together he's just so casual and nonchalant about sleeping with another woman in her bed, with her sheets she agonized to chose and she takes such pride to keep clean! Her mind races, what else will he do? Will he use her wedding ring? Will this woman drive her car? Her mind just can't shut down thinking of all this. So finally she decides to ask him about her stuff and figures she'd start with something easy asking, ""If I die and you remarry will you let her use my golf clubs?""

Now the guy who just wants to sleep and has been woken up to answer all this what he considers nonsense, honestly quite a bit irritated over this, and says, ""Well of course not.""

Shocked she replies back, ""well why not?""

He replies, ""because she's left handed, now go to sleep.""",She can't sleep (really long),10

They did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the midterms and labs, such that going into the final they had a solid ""A"".  These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chemistry final was on Monday), they decided to go up to the University of Tennessee and party with some friends.

They had a great time, however, with hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Mississippi until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found their professor after the final to explain to him why they missed the final.

They told him that they went up to the University of Tennessee for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back, and didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time, so they were late in getting back to campus. The professor thought this over and told them they could make up the final on the following day.  The two guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day for the final.

The professor placed them in separate rooms, and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was worth 5 points.  It was something simple about Molarity &amp; Solutions.

""Cool ,"" they thought.  ""This is going to be easy.""  They did that problem and then turned the page.

They were not prepared, however, for what they saw on this page. It said: (95 Points).  Which tire?",This Exam Is FINAL,173

One night, this frustration boiled over, and he headed out to find a bordello - surely, if he was to find a woman to accommodate his size, it would be there.

As he walks into the parlor, he eyes a man behind the counter and tells him his troubles. 

The man says, ""Well, that's a pickle, but I'm Harold, the janitor.

You want to speak with Helga, the Headmistress,"" pointing to the side.

He walks over to her and repeats the story. 

Money exchanges hands, and he's directed down the hall, first room on the left.

He's never actually been with a prostitute before, so some awkward conversation precludes intercourse. 

In the act, he manages to get a third of the way in before she starts yelping in pain. 

He pulls out, apologizes for the inconvenience, and goes back to the Headmistress.

She's a little taken aback, but still proposes a solution - second door, right side.

The man is a more than a little frustrated (and certainly a touch embarrassed), by this point, so no conversation occurs and he gets right into it. 

A third goes in. 

Then half. 

She yelps. 

He dismounts, and storms back to the Headmistress, not even bothering to put his clothes back on. 

He demands a refund.

She tells him that she has one last option for him - if it doesn't work, she will gladly refund every penny of his purchase. 

Last door on the left. 

He goes in, and the room is very dark. 

A woman lies on the bed, waiting for him. 

He mounts her - a third of the way, half-way, and all the way in. 

She offers no complaint. 

Gleefully he begins thrusting, when to his horror (and the dim light) he notices she appears to be foaming from the mouth.

 In a panic, he runs back to the Headmistress.

""That girl is foaming at the mouth! I think you need to call a doctor!""

""Well, while I was at work, I couldn't stop imagining having sex with the cast of Jersey Shore!  It was awful, and I got nothing done that day!""

The psychologist stroked his beard in deep thought.  ""You must understand,"" the psychologist replied, ""that these are just fantasies.  But carrying them out to make these feelings go away is obviously not advised, since this is rape.""

""Yeah, I understand.""  The man moaned in defeat as he put his head in his hands.

The two sat in silence for a moment, until the psychologist had a brilliant idea.  ""I think I can help you get over these perverse fantasies, but you must follow my every word.  Do you accept?""

The man nodded his head, and the psychologist began to walk the man through the procedure.

""Imagine that you're in front of a sprawling mansion, and the entire cast of Jersey Shore is standing in front of you.""

""No ... this is too hard.""  the man responded, trying to imagine with his eyes closed.

""You must continue, or these fantasies will continue.  Now, the cast is unaware of your existence.  They are busy playing volleyball in the pool, enjoying themselves.""

The man was wincing, trying to suppress his base desires.  The psychologist knew he had to act quickly or this therapy session would be all for nothing.

""Now,"" said the psychologist, ""insert yourself into the situation!  Are they looking at you now?""

The man opened his eyes, shook his head in surprise, and asked the psychologist, ""Hold on!  Didn't you say that was rape?""",A man went to see his therapist about his psychotic fantasy of making love to the members of Jersey Shore ..,0

A woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several months, yet she stayed by his bedside every day.
One day he told her, ""You have been with me through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you were there. When we lost the house, you were there. When my health started failing, you were there. You know what?""

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:
First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.
The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.
But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.
Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job...,8

I barely knew him but I took him into my apartment, where I was living with my girlfriend.

We spent most of our time drinking, watching football, talking about work. This went on for months and months. 

One day, I decided to propose to my girlfriend. Late one night I snuck into her room, and saw Joe forcing himself onto her. She was tied and gagged, and I went apeshit. I shoved him off of her and punched him straight in the eye, I'm no doctor but I know it will never heal right. He throws me down and I clammer for the dresser, and I pull out the handgun I keep in my sock drawer. My girlfriend leapt from the bed, screamed that she couldn't take it anymore, and said we were over. In the confusion, Joe dashed out of the apartment and I haven't seen him since.

I don't know where he went, or why he did this, but all I do know is, hadn't it been for cotton eye Joe, I'd been married a long time ago. Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton Eye Joe?

She searched for a few hours, but she only found one applicant who was interested. He came into the shop in pinstriped pajamas, and a banana-shaped hat. Still, despite his appearance, she really just wanted a break and thought she would give him a chance.

""What do I have to do?"" He asked.

""Very simple,"" the woman told him. ""If someone asks how much the flowers are, you say '10 cents, only 10 cents.' If they ask if they're fresh, you say 'fresh, fresh, very fresh.' And, if they ask if they should buy them, you say 'quick, quick, before somebody else does.'""

The guy agrees, and very soon after a customer comes in. They go up to the counter and ask ""how much are these flowers?""

He says ""Ten cents, only ten cents.""

A few minutes later, another customer comes in. This customer asks ""hey, are these flowers fresh?""

And the man says ""fresh, fresh, very fresh""

Soon after that, yet another customer comes in. The customer asks ""do you think I should buy these flowers?""

And the man says ""quick, quick, before somebody else does!""

This goes on for most of the day, until suddenly a robber comes in. The robber sticks a gun up to the guys head, and demands ""how much is in this cash register?!?""

The man says ""Ten cents, only ten cents.""

post,4r5jbm,2qh72,jokes,false,1467606547,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4r5jbm/jimmy/,self.jokes,,"Little Jimmy was on the playground during recess one day. He had just started kindergarten a few months ago. Jimmy was a good kid and the kind of student any teacher would love to have since he was always trying to learn new things. He always took his parents' advice to learn one new thing every day and today was no different from any other.

Little Jimmy was quietly playing in the sand by himself when one of the bigger kids, the size of a fifth grader, stomped up and pushed him to the ground. He leaned in close and whispered into Jimmy's ear, calling him a name Jimmy had never heard before. The kid leaned back and sneered his freckly face at Jimmy in a loathsome way while little Jimmy just stared at him, dumbstruck.

“What does that even mean?” little Jimmy asked. 

The kid's sneer grew into a smirk, “Go ask the teacher, she'll tell you!”

Now Jimmy may have only been five but he wasn't completely stupid. He knew he had just been called a bad name. But his curiosity was killing him so as soon as recess was over he raced inside to talk to the teacher. Maybe she could even tell him what it meant!

“Teacher, teacher! Before we start class can I ask you something?”

“What is it, Jimmy?” his teacher asked.

“Well, I was on the playground at recess and one of the big kids called me a bad word, but I don't even know what it means.”

Thinking Jimmy was more upset about the name-calling than the fact that he had no idea what the word meant, his teacher, completely well-versed in the idea that five year-olds thought that “poop” was a bad word, decided to cut him the deal she usually did in these cases, since the kids were usually clearly uncomfortable saying words like “doo-doo-head” out loud. “Okay Jimmy, I can only help you if you tell me the word. But since it's a bad word you can just whisper it in my ear and I will take care of it.”

Jimmy hesitates but a moment before leaning in and whispering in her ear. Her eyes grew wide and she shouted, “JIMMY, THAT'S HORRIBLE! GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW, YOUNG MAN, YOU ARE IN DETENTION!”

Jimmy yelped but obediently ran down to the principal's office before. It's rare that a five year-old gets detention in and of itself but Jimmy had never been in trouble before. He was scared.

Jimmy sat down in a chair outside of the principal's office, impatiently kicking his legs and twiddling his thumbs. The principal was inside having a phone conversation, likely with Jimmy's teacher. After a few minutes the door creaked open an the principal smiled at Jimmy. “Come in, sit down.” Again, Jimmy obeyed and stared dejectedly at the placard that said “PRINCIPAL.”

“Now Jimmy, you're a good kid,” Jimmy didn't look up. “I know you're a good kid. So I need you to tell me in your own words, why do you think you're here?”

“Well, you see, I was on the playground at recess and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me here.”

“I see. Well Jimmy, since you're such a good kid and all, what word could be so horrible that your teacher would send you to me?” His eyes were wide with surprise that this was all that it took.

“Well, I dunno. It must be a pretty bad word...”

“Jimmy, I'm your principal. It's my job to look out for your well-being. It's just us two in here, but if you want you can just whisper it in my ear if that makes you feel better. You can trust me.”

Jimmy sighed and leaned over to the principal and carefully whispered into the principal's ear. His eyes grew wide and he slammed his fists down on his desk, making his placard jump and fall to the ground, “JIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE! GO HOME RIGHT NOW YOU ARE EXPELLED!”

Jimmy walked out of the office, defeated. On his way home he kicked rocks and dawdled. Eventually he found his way through the front door. His mother had been sitting patiently waiting for him.

“Jimmy, sweetheart,” her eyes were filled with concern for her son. “What happened at school today? I just got off the phone with your pricipal. He seemed really angry.”

Jimmy looked up at her with eyes as big as dinner plates. “Okay, so I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home.”

“Sweetie, what word could be so horrible that you would get expelled from school?” His mother's mind was racing as to where he even learned a bad word, they never used bad language at home.

“Mom... I don't know... it must be a pretty bad word, it's gotten me in a lot of trouble already.” Jimmy stared at his feet as his mom closed in. She leaned down and gave him a great big hug.

“I'm your mommy. You can tell me anything and I'll love you and take care of you no matter what. But I can't fix this for you if you don't tell me what the word was. I'll tell you what, even though it's just you and me you can lean in and whisper it in my ear, okay? You can trust me.”

Jimmy was close to tears but he put on a brave face and nodded before leaning in and whispering into her ear.

Her eyes grew wide and she practically threw Jimmy from her arms. “JIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE!” she shrieked, “GO TO YOUR ROOM YOU ARE GROUNDED! FOREVER!”

Jimmy slowly and sadly climbed up the stairs to his bedroom. He sat on his bed, still fighting back tears but just barely. The hours stretched and he just stared at the wall, feeling hopeless. Eventually, just before dark, he heard his father's car pull up into the driveway. The sound of his footsteps followed to the front door and once his father came inside he could hear his parents speaking in hushed tones. 

Eventually his father climbed the stairs and softly opened the door to Jimmy's room. “Heya kiddo. I just talked to your mom. Do you want to tell me what happened?”

“Um, well... I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me. Forever.”

“It must be a pretty bad word then, huh?”

“Yeah.”

“Look, Jimmy, I would love to get you out of the doghouse with your mom. I can help but only if you tell me what the word was.”

Jimmy just stared at him as tears welled up in his eyes.

“Jimmy, we're both men here. Women can be over-sensitive, but I think I can handle it. If you're uncomfortable you can just whisper it in my ear. You can trust me, okay?”

Jimmy looked unconvinced but wanted to believe in his father. He took a big gulp and leaned close to whisper into his father's ear. His dad's eyes grew wide and his father stood up, screaming “JIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE! GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! I HAVE NO SON!”

Jimmy froze for a moment before booking it out of the house. He ran as fast and as far as his feet would carry him and before long it was completely dark out. Eventually he slowed down almost to a complete stop, dragging his feet along the sidewalk. Eventually he just sat on the curb and cried. After a few minutes a police car puled up to poor little Jimmy on the curb.

“Son, come here.” Jimmy looked but but didn't move. “Son, come here, it's okay. What's your name?”

Jimmy's eyes were those of a shell-shocked soldier, “Um... it's Jimmy, sir.”

“Well, Jimmy, what are you doing out alone after dark?”

Jimmy took a deep breath. “It all started when I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me to my room forever. Then my dad yelled at me and kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back and that he had no son.”

“Well, Jimmy...” a look of concern crossed the officer's face, “what word could be so horrible that your dad would kick you out of the house?”

A look of fear flashed across Jimmy's face. “Uh... I dunno. It must be a pretty bad word, it's gotten me in so much trouble already....”

“Jimmy,” the cop flashed a genuine smile, “No little boy should be on his own. No matter how bad the word is. I'm a police officer and it's my duty to serve and protect you. If it makes you feel better you can just whisper it in my ear.”

Jimmy felt conflicted but the police officer's offer seemed sincere enough that he eventually leaned in and ever-so-softly whispered into his ear.

“JIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE!” The cop was on him in an instant. He whipped out his handcuffs and slammed poor Jimmy's face into the hood of the car, the whole while reading him his rights.

Later, in court, Jimmy found himself staring up at a judge. She didn't look scary but Jimmy could barely keep from pissing his little trousers.

“Jimmy,” she said authoritatively, “Do you have any idea why you're here today?”

Jimmy had a thousand-yard stare, “Well your honour, it all started when I was on the playground at recess the other day and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me to my room forever. Then my dad yelled at me and kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back and that he had no son. The police officer arrested me and now I'm here.” Tears welled up in his eyes.

“Well now, Jimmy, what word could be so horrible that you would get arrested?”

Pure panic took him. “Well... gee... your honour its got me in so much trouble already... I really don't know if I could say it in front of all of these people.”

“Jimmy, look, if you're really worried you may approach the bench and whisper it in my ear.”

Jimmy's face was white and he didn't respond.

“Look Jimmy, I don't want to see a five year-old to be convicted of a crime, but I really can't help you unless I know what the word is. And I'll just remind you that you are under oath.”

Jimmy approached the judge in a zombie-like state. He leaned in close, whispered into the judge's ear and without missing a beat the judge slammed down his gavel, “JIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE! I SENTENCE YOU TO TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE!”

Twenty year's later Jimmy is serving the last day of his sentence in a maximum security prison. They've tried to keep him isolated from the other prisoners but overcrowding in the prison system has led to him being forced to share a cell for his final few hours. A man with face tattoos jacked from the floor to the ceiling with muscles was dumped in through the cell door.

“Hey.”

Jimmy didn't say anything at first.

“Hey. Look at me when I'm talking to you.” Jimmy made eye contact for a moment before pulling his eyes away. “You, what's your name.”

“Jimmy.”

“Jimmy, eh? Name's Eddie. What're you in for?”

“It's really a long story.”

“Try me, I've got nowhere else to be.” Eddie smiled in earnest at Jimmy. Jimmy felt everything in his body screaming at him not to talk about what happened twenty years ago, but at the same time he'd been isolated for so long he just felt the need to let it out.

“Okay, you see... twenty years ago I was five years old. I'm on the playground, minding my own business during reccess. One of the older kids called me some curse word and I didn't even know what it meant. So I asked the teacher about it and she starts screaming like a banshee and I get sent to the office. The principal ended up expelling me so I went home. My mom completely lost her shit and tried to put me under house arrest. My dad ended up disowning me and then a police officer stopped to help but when he found out he arrested me. The judge sentenced me to twenty years without parole. But I get out today, and soon.” Jimmy felt some relief but also terror because even though he had no education other than what he learned in prison he wasn't too stupid to not know what was coming next.

“Well, Jesus! What word could be so horrible you'd get locked up in here?”

“You know... this word has gotten me in so much shit already I don't want to go through this again. Especially since as of today my time has been served.”

“Jimmy, look at me. You said a bad word as a five year-old and you're locked up with me. You know what I did? I strangled my girlfriend until she passed out, tried to smother her with a pillow, and when that took too long I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her thirty-seven times in the chest. I ain't no rocket surgeon but I can't think of any words more horrible than what I done to her. Look, I get it if you don't want the other guys to hear. Just whisper it to me, no one else has to know.”

Jimmy straightened himself, readying for the response as he leaned in close and whispered to Eddie.

Eddie recoiled in horror, “JIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE!” Jimmy began to raise his hands to defend himself. But Eddie just stared at him slack-jawed before giving him a heart slap on the back. “Jesus. You got me.”

8It felt like Jimmy had been holding his breath for years and he had finally been allowed to exhale.  “You wanna know what the worst part is? I still don't even know what it *means*.”

“Well Jimmy, I can't explain it to you.” Jimmy's face fell, “But I do know a guy. I can give you his address, he'll be able to make it clear to you why you've been put through hell way better'n I can. His name is Lou.”

Tears of gratitude leaked from Jimmy's sunken eyes and he gave Eddie the biggest hug he could muster. Eddie didn't seem to mind.

Finally, once Jimmy was left to his own devices, he tracked down the address and found it was just across the street from where he was standing. Jimmy was so excited to finally have some answers that he bolted across the street.

Unfortunately for Jimmy he ran into the path of an on-coming bus and he died instantly.

***********

Phew! This is my go-to bar joke. You tell it about two drinks in so people are a little more open to listening to a rambling, repetitive story. I actually had one person jokingly threaten to murder me for wasting approximately ten minutes of their life and another friend still playfully slaps me across the face any time I say the name “Jimmy.” I've never typed it out before, this was fun. At just over 2,700 words it took me two sittings.
