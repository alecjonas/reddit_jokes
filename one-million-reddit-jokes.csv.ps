St. Peter says ""You get to choose which place you want to go to.  I'll show you each place today and you can sleep on it and decide tomorrow.""  So he takes them to heaven and everybody's sitting on gold jeweled thrones playing harps and singing God's praises.  They both say ""Oh, this looks good.""  

But St. Peter insists on bringing them to the other place.  The Devil answers the door and brings them to a big banquet hall with every kind of food and delicacy to choose from-- steak and lobster and caviar and fresh vegetables and fruits.  The wine is flowing, and there's plenty of coke, and there are some gorgeous women who seem interested in the 2 politicians.  All their friends are there singing and dancing and telling jokes.  

Then they leave and go to sleep outside the Pearly Gates for the night.  The next morning St. Peter asks ""Well, which place do you want?""  They say ""Well, heaven  is a really nice place.  But I think we'll be more comfortable down in hell with my friends.""      

So St. Peter brings them down to hell.  The Devil answers the door.  There are all these people standing in excrement up to their butts, drinking coffee.  Then the Devil says ""Okay, coffee break's over, go back to standing on your heads now.""  

The politicians get mad,  ""Why did you deceive us, St. Peter?"" they ask.  St. Pete Says ""This is the Devil's place.  Talk to him about it.""  So they turn to the Devil and say ""That's not fair.  Why did you deceive us?""

As the last guy got up to the sergeant, the sergeant said, “sorry son, we’re all out. Take this broom instead.” The private looked puzzled so the sergeant explained, “When you see the enemy, point the broom at them and say ‘bangity, bangity, bang.’ Don’t worry, it will work fine.”

So the private and the rest of his squad headed out to the battle field. Shortly after they started marching, the private spotted an enemy. Reluctantly, he put the broom up to his shoulder, aimed down the handle and shouted, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Much to his surprise, the enemy fell over. A few moments later, he spotted another enemy, pointed his broom, and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” Again, the enemy fell over. 

This, of course energized the private so he jumped up, pointed his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang,” “bangity, bangity, bang,” ‘bangity, bangity, bang.’ Enemies fell all around him. 

Off in the distance, he spotted another enemy, raised his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” This time, however, the enemy didn’t fall over. As the enemy got closer, the private pointed his broom and shouted even louder, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Still, the enemy didn’t fall and, instead, just kept marching toward the private. 

The enemy got within feet of the private and one more time he aimed his broom and screamed, “bangity, bangity, bang.” But the enemy just kept on marching. He walked into the private, knocked him over, stepped on him and kept on walking. And as he went by, the private heard the enemy say, “tankity, tankity, tank, tankity, tankity, tank.”

He shocked the bird and the bird just got more angry and more rude. Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the bird in the freezer, just for a few moments. He heard the bird squawk and kick and scream-then suddenly, there was quiet. 

David was frightened that he might have hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door. The parrot calmly stepped out and said ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'll endeavor at once to correct my behavior. I really am truly sorry and beg your forgiveness."" David was astonished at the bird's change in attitude and was about to ask what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot continued, ""May I ask what did the chicken do?""",David received a parrot for his birthday,323

The immigrant picked up the bottle, rubbed the sand off it, and a genie appeared.
“I can only grant three wishes,” the genie said. “Since there are three of you, you may have a wish each.”
Pointing at the illegal immigrant, he said, “Since you found the bottle, you may have the first wish.”
The illegal immigrant said, “This country is racist against my people! I wish to take every illegal immigrant back to their homeland with a wall 1000 feet high to exclude everyone else, then we can finally be happy and live in peace!”
The genie clapped his hand and the illegal immigrant was transported to his homeland along with millions of “his” people inside a 1000 foot wall.  
Turning to the Jihadist, the genie asked, “And what is your wish?”  The radical Muslim Jihadist said, “This country is bigoted against those who practice Sharia Law! I wish to take all of my people away from this horrible place loaded with infidels so we can live in a theocracy in Islamic countries and serve Allah inside a 10,000 foot wall.  The genie clapped his hands and the jihadist, along with every other Radical Muslim in the country, was instantly transported to the Middle East inside their wall.

My dad passed away last year and my mom doesn't spend much time with me as she's usually very tired after drinking wine. I know that you brought all those rich kids from school plenty of fancy toys last year, but I don't care for these. However, I wish you could bring me a hat, a scarf and a pair of gloves, so I could go out and play with my friends in the snow. That would be the most beautiful day of my life. With love, Johnny"".
A post office employee intercepts the letter, reads if, and is moved by the little kid's story. She decides to go around the office and collect some money to buy little Johnny the gift he's been dreaming of.
After chasing everyone in the office, she manages to gather $13... $14... $15. After work, she goes to a little shop nearby to buy the hat, scarf and gloves. Unfortunately, she only has enough money for a hat and a scarf. Oh well, that should do just fine. She wraps the gift, attaches a letter with it ""Dear Johnny, here is the gift you've asked me for. Enjoy the company of your friends on this very special day. Your friend, Santa"", and sends it to the kid. She feels great - a little kid's dream has been achieved thanks to her and her colleagues from the post office.
One week later, she intercepts another letter from the kid addressed to Santa, and is excited to read about the kid's wonderful Christmas Day: ""Dear Santa. I received your gift, thank you very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't go out and play with my friends and had to stay home with my mom (she gets pretty mean after two bottles of wine), because there were only a hat and a scarf in the box (no gloves), and my mom wouldn't let me go out without a pair of gloves.

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he 
hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. 
Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to 
tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.

In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... . Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts.
I'll do the fuckin’ dishes!!",Joe wanted to buy a Harley motorcycle.,648

The Bartender sees such a vivid depth

To say something exists requires knowledge of self,
which requires knowledge of existence of the self, 
an obviously impossible leap of logic,
absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.
The Bartender,
in that single instant within the Horse's mind,
became the nothingness the Horse perceived, 
and thus was rendered speechless.
If neither the Horse,
nor the Bartender,
nor the bar itself can be said to exist,
then why should he ask,
how could he ask,
""why the long face?""
The question can have no meaning,
and that which has no meaning cannot be stated.
The Bartender, dumbstruck, not by realization of mortality
but by fundamental doubt that he was ever alive,
gazes into the endless depth of the Horse's eyes,
and asks him, ""Sir, I beg you say, do I exist?""

""Well..."" He said, ""just... listen. So I did what you said just before she arrived, and I felt confident I wouldn't end up tenting for all of the second date. So I when I heard her knock on the door, I just swung it open with all the confidence in the world.""

The man's face slowly gets redder. ""She was standing at my front door, her makeup was perfect and she had this super tight dress on, dude you should've seen her!""

We stayed at a small local hotel about 30 minutes from the city. The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said “I’m amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!” She replied “no one expects the Spanish inn physician.”

The skeptic shakes his head mutters, “Unbelievable.” walks back to the bar and orders another drink.

After a few minutes, the jumper says, “I’ll show you again” and he coaxes the skeptic back to the window. Hops up on the ledge and jumps. After falling about 50 floors, his fall slows and he starts to rise. A few seconds later, he’s back on the window ledge smiling. 

Once again the skeptic shakes his head, walks back to the bar and orders another drink. After finishing the drink, he says, “I’m gonna try that.” The two of them walk over to the window. He hops up onto the ledge, hesitates for a moment then jumps. 

The first guy watches as the jumper falls 100 floors to his death.

George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says,
""Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""
 
She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""
 
While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" George also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked . . . ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . .
why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?""
 
So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . .
and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.
 
After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""
 
""My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.""

Joe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. 

About 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.

About 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. 

It wasn't 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.

The whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, ""Go to the nearest casino,"" over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, ""Cash in all your money for chips."" This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it's doing. 

His chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, ""Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino."" Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, ""Put all your money on Red 6."" Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, ""Loser! It landed on Black 13.""
Joe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,"".....Fuck.""",Gambling problem...,3

A farmer wanted to have his hens serviced, so he went to the market looking for a rooster. He was hoping he could get a special rooster - one that would service all of his many hens.
When he told this to the market vendor, the vendor replied, ""I have just the rooster for you. Henry here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!""
So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. ""Henry"", he said, ""I'm counting on you to do your stuff."" And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.
Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.
The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, ""Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself."" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.
Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.
The farmer walked up to Henry saying, ""Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy.""

The Territory Government approved and the CSIRO contracted a bird pathologist to examine the remains of all the crows and he confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu, much to everyone’s relief.

However, he determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, and only 2% were killed by car impact. The Territory Government then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine the disproportionate percentages for truck versus car kills.

After 18 months of research and $2.7 million spent, the Ornithological Behaviourist determined the cause in the deaths. When crows eat road kill, they always set-up a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. His conclusion was that the lookout crow could say “Cah”, but he could not say “Truck”.

His room (and any room for that matter) wouldn't be available until tomorrow. The receptionist told the man that if he asked nicely he might be permitted to stay one night in the local temple along with the monks. So the man made his way to the temple. Once there he was greeted by an old monk. 

""Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?""

""Of course!"" said the monk. ""We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound.""

""What strange sound?"" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.

""I wish I could tell you"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""

Although bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. 

""I'm sorry"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""

""Ok, then I want to become a monk"", said the man.

""Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it.""

""I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound.""

""Very well"", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. ""To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.""

The man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. 
Many, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. 

""So?""

""I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!"" the man said with triumph on his face.

""I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.""

""So... I get to see the source of the sound?""

""Yes, you may. Follow me please.""

So he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.

""Behind here, is the source of the sound"", said the monk.

""FINALLY!"" the man thought to himself. ""I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound.""
He walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. 


And what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound.",A man went on vacation to Thailand once...,25

Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window:
'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.
 
""Fucking get in there you cunt!"" he says to himself and goes to the bar.
""Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt"", he says to a somewhat startled barman.
The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs.
""Can I help you sir?' he says.
""Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!""
 
The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.
 
At the end the thrilled barman cries,
""Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?""
""That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' ""
""Oh"" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, ""err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?""
""Fucking wanker..."" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.
 
The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.
""That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' ""
""I see"" says the manager. ""Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?""
""Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' "".
 
""Look,"" says the manager, ""I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.""
 
""Fuck it"", says the pianist, ""why cunting not?""
On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.
 
During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.
 
After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.
""Hi"" she says.
""Oh, hello"" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.
She leans over and whispers in his ear,
""Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?""
Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,
""Know it? I fucking wrote it!!""",An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets...,59

The Hindu offers to take his place because he is used to bad smells from his childhood in India.

However less than 5 minutes later the Hindu knocks at the door of the house and explains he cannot sleep there because there is a cow in the barn and they are too sacred to sleep by in his religion. Finally the Muslim offers to take his place in the barn.

Vinny brings his whole family to the courtroom to cheer him on. They are a very loud and rambunctious Italian family.
Vinny stands in front of the judge and the judge says, ""Ok Vinny, before you become an American citizen I have to ask you a few questions about American history""

Vinny very confidently says, ""Hey, not a problem judge."" As he looks back to his family, he can see that they are all very excited and waiting with eager anticipation.

The judge says ""Ok Vinny, who was the first president of the United States?""

Vinny responds, ""Oh judge, that's-a easy one... George-a Washington!""

Immediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear ""Hey Vinny!"" ""That-a boy!"" ""Way to go!""
The judge puts his hands up ""Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?""

Vinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says ""Judge, another easy one... 1776!""
Once again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. ""Way to go Vinny!"" ""That-a boy!""

""Calm down, calm down"" says the judge.

At this point Vinny is pretty confident. He is looking back at his family, giving them a couple of ""Hey-yo, howya doins"" and they are loving it.

It seems as if the judge has lost all control of the courtroom. The family is on their feet and Vinny is in love with himself.

The judge says, ""Ok Vinny last question.""

""Not-a problem judge"" Vinny replies.

The judge kind of smirks, knowing there is no way that Vinny gets this one. He says, ""Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?""

The crowd goes silent.

Vinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one.

Vinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, ""Hey-a judge... well I-a... I don't know that one.""

His family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize.

From deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... ""That-a boy Vinny! Don't-a squeal on-a nobody!""",[Long] Vinny comes to America,5

&amp;nbsp;  
Once there was this millionaire who was looking for a suitable wife. He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day “I’m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Okay honey, anything for you”.  
&amp;nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me, I’ll tell you” the man said “Just don’t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn’t stand it anymore and asked her husband “I know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What’s with the two black sharks in a white pool?”   
&amp;nbsp;  
The man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Distraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. “Honey, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Of course darling, anything for you”.  
&amp;nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me and I’ll be glad to tell you” the man says “Whatever you do, just don’t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. “Okay darling. You don’t have to worry.” But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. “Darling,” she said “I know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?”  
&amp;nbsp;  
The man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  
&amp;nbsp;  
On their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. “Oh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Anything for you my love”.  
&amp;nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me, nothing is secret” the man said “But do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool”. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. “My love” she said “I know you don’t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?”  
&amp;nbsp;  
The man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered “Good evening officers, what can I help you with?”  
&amp;nbsp;  
“Sir we have some information about you and a dead body” one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. “What’ve you been digging here?” says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  
&amp;nbsp;  
In the police station they interrogate the man. “Why do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?” The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he’d accidentally killed. “I loved each one of them” says the millionaire “But even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.”  
&amp;nbsp;  
Confused, the police officer interrogating the man asks “What is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.” The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  
&amp;nbsp;  
To this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.
