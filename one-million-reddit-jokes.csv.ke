Over one particular summer they restored a classic old car. Each step was a learning experience. When a part was rusted, uncle Stu would explain all about the process of rusting and how it differed with different metals such as iron, copper and brass. Bobby was quite bright and eagerly listened and learned.
Late in the summer the car was just about complete and they were ready to start it up. They filled the tank with gasoline and cranked it but it didn’t start up. Uncle Stu looked at the engine and peered down the carburetor. As he suspected it was missing the choke plate. This led him to launch into a long lesson on spark ignition, stoichiometric air fuel ratios and the need for rich mixtures to help with starting a cold engine. He thought he knew where the missing part was and he sent Billy to the far corner of the junkyard to look for a round metal plate on the ground. Moments later Billy came running back screaming in pain! He found the plate but he didn’t realize it was on top of a fire ant mound. Uncle Stu was mortified and quickly brushed the few ants off his nephew and calmed him down. To make things worse, it was the wrong part: the plate was too big for the carburetor. This time uncle Stu went off to look for the missing piece and soon found it. Coincidentally it was on the ground next to another anthill but this time they were common black ants. Naturally uncle Stu called Billy over and began to explain the difference between common ants and stinging ants and how fire ants have stingers in their abdomens that inject a painful venom. After he imparted all his entomology knowledge they returned to the car and fixed the carburetor. Billy was overjoyed when the car they had worked on for so long fired up and idled smoothly! 
It was the end of a perfect day. They put the car back in the garage and as they walked back to the house uncle Stu asked his nephew what his favorite lesson of the project had been. Without missing a beat Billy replied, “the real choke is in the calm ants”",Little Billy loved to visit at his uncle’s junkyard,5

If you don't believe it's original, search this sub for the word ""pheromones"" (keyword in the joke) and that joke will pop as a result. The rest are a different joke.

This affair lasted a long time and eventually led to a love child, which turned out to be a piece of sentient coral. Santa Claus found out about this child and was furious. Mrs. Claus decided to disown the child, and shamefully abandoned the child in the woods. A pack of wolves found the coral child, and raised it as their own. The wolves being great parents, this coral child grew up to be a healthy coral adult. The coral had grown a resentment towards his biological parents, who the wolves had told him about because wolves know everything, and just wanted to be accepted by his actual parents. He decided the best thing to do would be to build a grand thing for his parents, to show them that he was not a failure. He returns to the sea and amasses a coalition of coral, and creates his own country of other sentient coral. This coral country grows to be a grand nation, and the coral child returns to the north pole to see his parents, and brings them back to the nation of coral. ""Look at what I have built for you, I have achieved greatness"" the coral child says. Santa Clause turns to look at all of the coral, and then back to the child, ""I am still disappointed in you, you will always be a failure to me"".

I guess that just proves that coral nation does not equal Claus elation.",Little Known Story About Mr. and Mrs. Claus,4

This was the first time he had been given such an honor and he wanted to do it right. Before he went to work he decided to call the weatherman to ask what kind of a winter was to be expected. The weather man told him it was going to be a warm and uneventful winter. The boy thought to himself, ‘this is great. I won’t have to work too hard and I’ll be able to look good in front of the whole tribe.’

Just to be safe, he gathered a few of his friends and they went to work for a week. At the end of the week, after chopping and piling the wood, the boy decided to give the weatherman a second call. The weatherman told him it was going to be a very cold winter. Shocked at this sudden change and not wanting to disappoint the elders of his village, he gathered more of his friends and they went to work. For two weeks they cut and piled wood, hoping that it would be enough to last the whole winter.

Once again the boy called the weatherman and this time the weatherman told him, “Son, its going to be a very bitter, cold and long winter. Maybe the worst winter on record.”

Exasperated, the boy had to ask, “What makes you say that sir?”

As he exits his car he finds no mechanic shops or gas stations along the road and his phone is out of the  service area. Luckily a farmer on a tractor stopped by and offered his support.

Farmer: ""You look like you could use a pickup!""

Businessman: ""I sure could. You know where the nearest mechanic shop is?""

Farmer: ""Shoot. The closest one is at least 15 miles away, I'll take your car back and have it ready by tomorrow morning!""

Businessman: ""I sure appreciate that sir, thank you!""

The businessman loads up inside the farmers tractor and they tow his car back to his farm. As the farmer finishes unloading his truck, he leads the businessman into his home. 

Farmer: ""I believe in Southern Hospitality mister. My house is your house. You can sit in my chair at the dinner table. Eat whatever you like. Hell.. you can even fuck my wife.""

The businessman thinking he was joking about the last part, chuckles, accepts the hospitalility, and carries on his meeting brief. Dinner time rolls around and the farmer's wife comes in. She's drop dead gorgeous and much younger than the old farmer.

After dinner is over and everyone cleans up, it's bedtime.

Farmer : "" We only have one bed. I want you to be comfy so you get the spot in the middle where it's the softest.""

As they slide into bed, the farmer falls straight to sleep. Soon his wife gets on top of the businessman and begs him:

Wife: "" Please fuck me. This old man can't get it up anymore and he won't mind. Believe me!""

Businessman: "" I don't know. It's rude and I don't wanna wake him up.""

Wife: ""Hogwash! Go pluck a hair off his ass and watch he won't move a bit.""

So the businessman leans over quietly. *Pluck* The farmer doesn't wake up. Curious and for good measure he gives another *pluck* and sure enough the farmer is sound asleep. He then gets on top of the farmer's wife and goes to town. Every so often while fucking her he would pluck a hair off the farmers ass to make sure he's asleep. All night this goes on, pluckin' and fuckin'.

The next morning is quiet around the breakfast table until the farmer breaks the silence.

Farmer: "" Now I told you I believe in Southern Hospitality. I told you, you could sit in my chair. Eat my food. Even fuck my wife... But I never said you could use my ass as a scoreboard!""",A businessman breaks down on the side of a country road...,338

This was problematic for her as it had been a tradition in her family going back almost a thousand years to name the first born of each generation ""Lin"". After some discussion from her husband, they decide to name both the boy and the girl ""Lin"", for the sake of not ending the tradition.


Lin and Lin grew up having a relatively normal life, except for the fact that the boy Lin was bullied pretty consistently for having a girls name. Once a month or so, the boy Lin would come home in tears asking, ""Mom, Dad, why did you give me a girls name?"" But they would just pat him on the back and say ""It's tradition, Lin.""


Well this continued until Lin and Lin's 18th Birthday party. Their whole family was invited, and as you can imagine it was hell organizing the seating when about a third of everyone present was named Lin. At one point the boy Lin called for silence and announced to the room; ""Now that I am 18, I intend to legally change my name to Lee."" There were gasps and dropped glasses throughout the room. His parents fled the room, unable to look at him. ""But why brother?"" Asked the girl Lin, feeling hurt.


A voice soaked in alcohol rang from across the room; ""Cause issa girls name!"" It was the Lin twins great uncle, also named Lin. ""As another man forced to go through his life with a girls name, I fully support your decision."" He gifted each of the twins $100 for their birthday, and left.


The next day, the boy Lin brought his $100 down to the court house, and asked for a form to legally change his name to ""Lee.""

""Just so you know, it's a fee of another hundred bucks to stop the process after you've signed here, in case you change your mind."" Said the clerk.

""I won't."" The boy Lin responded, signing.

""Brother!"" The girl Lin burst through the door of the courthouse just as the clerk took the paperwork away.

""It's too late sister, in a few hours I will legally be Lee."" 


The sister pleaded with him for the next hour until finally he cracked. How could he so calously throw away nearly a thousand years of tradition. He approached the clerk, but his heart sunk. ""Lin-"" he said to his sister, ""I already spent all my money. I don't have the $100 to stop this process.""


Determined to see this through, the girl Lee reached into her pocket and took out the hundred she had received from their drunk uncle Lin. ""It's okay, brother, I will pay the fee.""


Just then the Lin Twins drunk uncle Lin burst through the door. He yelled:


""DON'T STOP! BE LEE, LIN! HOLD ON TO THAT FEE, LIN, YEEEEAH!""

The three then stumbled upon a tiger. This tiger was about to crack open a cold beer. The rabbit looked at the tiger for a second and then said, ""Tiger, don't drink alcohol. Alcohol is a drug, and drugs are bad for you. Come running with us through the forest!""
The Tiger then looked at the rabbit, then at the beer, then back at the rabbit, and then cracked open the beer and carefully placed it on the ground next to him. He then proceeded to slowly walk over to the rabbit, lifted his paw up, and then mauled the shit out of the rabbit. After he was done he slowly walked back to the beer, picked it up and started drinking it.

The giraffe and the sheep were shocked. The giraffe looked at the tiger and said, ""Dude!!! What the fuck? He was just trying to help you!!! Why did you hurt him?""

Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.

'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'

The woman exposes both breasts to the gorilla and it gets very excited and is now desperately trying to escape from the enclosure.

Says Mark: 'This is incredible, now, pull your skirt up, turn around and expose your butt and let us see what happens!'
 
The woman pulls her skirt up, turns around with her butt to the gorilla, which by now, was extremely aroused, breaks free from the enclosure, grabs the woman and starts yanking the clothes off her.

The man hops down and the horse allows him to pet it. The man takes the horse around to local camp sites to find the owner but none of the locals own it.
So the man takes the horse back to his unit above the bar and says, ""Sorry mate I will have to leave you here"" and then the man heads off to bed.

The next day the man has forgotten all about being suicidal and has a new view on life. He grabs his resume and goes off to find a new job. Waiting outside is the horse, who now looks happy, and the man is surprised that it is still there.

While the man is petting the horse a woman and her daughter come by, and then the horse gets on it's hind legs and starts to put on a show. Amazed by the horse, the woman gives the man a few dollars, and then the man thinks ""Hey I could make some money off this"", so the man and horse begin doing there show at local parks.
Over time word gets out about the man and his horse and they become a worldwide sensation. Over the next few weeks the man buys a ranch for the horse to stay in and everything continues to go great. 

Eventually their act ends up on Conan, and during their act a woman stand sup in the crowd and yells ""That's my horse!"", and after a multitude of lawsuits it turned out that the horse did actually belong to her.
The man asks the woman if they could just do one more show at a big arena, and the woman agrees reluctantly. The show is a hit, people applaud and cry at the duo's final show.

The man, saddened by the upcoming departure, says with a smile to the horse, ""Thank you for everything you did for me, you can keep the ranch"", and now the horse is sad, so he heads back to his apartment with the horse and as they walk into the bar for a final drink the barman asks, ""Hey man why the long face?""",There is a man down on his luck...,1

Newton replies ""Interesting. Well, do go on.""

Einstein explains, ""Imagine two people at opposite ends on top of a train moving very quickly. Even though the train is moving, if the person in the rear shines a light to the other in the front, they will measure the light to move at the usual constant speed of light. Likewise though, a person stationary beside the tracks will also measure the light to travel at the same speed, though from their stationary perspective the light traveled further because by the time the light got to the front person, they had moved a little bit more forward due to the velocity of the train. This means that the stationary person sees the light take longer to go from one person to the other.""

He adds, ""Additionally, if the person in the rear of the train measures the velocity of the light away from him to be one value, shouldn't the velocity they themselves possess not mean that the light would move faster from getting that extra push? But when we measure it, this is not the case!""

""If we allow ourselves to alter values like the passage of time for different perspectives, and even the masses of objects, we can create a set of physical laws which shows us how the people on the train can reconcile their views with the person beside it, based upon their relative velocities.""

The bartender hands it to him, and goes to help someone else. The man drinks some of his beer, looking around to see if there's a TV anywhere to see the game, when suddenly he catches a glimpse of a man with a huge, orange head. He waits for the bartender to walk by, and he goes, ""What's the deal with the guy with the big orange head?"" The bartender replies, ""If you buy him a drink he'll tell you his story."" So the man walks over to the guy with the big orange head and says hello. Orange head inturrupts him. ""I know why you're talking to me. I'll tell you why, just buy me a drink. Any IPA will do."" So the man buys him his beer and sits down in the stool next to orange head. ""it all began many years ago when my wife divorced me...""

""I was in a slump. I was depressed, I wouldn't help myself, and the only reason I would get out of bed was that my bank account was running dry, and I needed work. One day, my best friend Mike noticed that I wasn't myself. I tried to be the usual fun and rowdy me when we went out, but my spirit just... wasn't there. I'm probably shit at poker, because I can't conceal my emotions at all. Anyway, back to Mike. I respect the man, but he's a trust fund baby. Never has to work a day in his life. He's incredibly rich, and to be honest I'm jealous. He  used this money on some dumb things, but that day he offered to take me on an ""anti-depressing weekend."" He got some tickets to a cruise, and told me to pack my bags. I met him there, and we hopped on board the giant boat. I never thought I'd get on one of these, but hey, I'm not me right now. Why not. The first day we swam, played games, and got wasted. It was, dare I say, fun. That night, there was an incredible lightning storm. We were advised to go into the cabins and just hunker down, but I didn't want to. I love a good storm, so I sat alone on the deck watching the storm and getting drenched. Then, disaster. Lightning struck the deck. I got thrown off into the water, and I passed out holding onto some wood. Then, I woke up. I was on a tropical island, like the one in the movie ""castaway."" I searched for any people, food, or water when suddenly I found an old looking water bottle. I picked it up, opened the top, and out popped a genie. Yes, a genie. He said to me in this booming voice, "" You have freed me from my jail. I will grant you three and only three wishes. You can't wish for more, that's not how it works. So when you decide on the three, return to me."" I thought about it for a while, and I decided to wish for great wealth. It was my time to be as rich as Mike. I returned to the genie and asked for great riches. He snapped his fingers and instantly my tattered rags turned into a blazer, with the pockets full of cash. I didn't wanna waste my next wish, so I didn't use it just yet. Eventually, Mike had me tracked down and I returned home. I contemplated what my next wish would be, and after a couple months I knew what I needed. I bought a speedboat, and returned to that island. I met the genie there, and wished for the most beautiful woman in the world to be my wife. Instantly, out of the ocean walked the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I popped a ring out of my pocket, and proposed then and there. We got married, and after a couple years had kids. I didn't know what I wanted for a wish after that. I had all I needed! Hot, smart wife, beautiful children, and all the money my family would need for generations. I thought about it for years when one day it hit me. I needed one more thing in my life. I returned to the island for the final time. I went up to the genie and demanded my third wish..."" The orange headed man paused in suspence. ""Now here's where I went wrong. I wished for a big orange head.""",A man walks into a bar...,2

It's been a long day, and he's heard dozens of of pianists play, but none of them have had that special something he's looking for. The last audition of the day comes in, sits at the piano, and starts playing the audition piece.

In short it's perfect. The piano bar owner has to restrain himself from applauding at the end, and says, ""That was fantastic, what else have you got?""

The pianist replies that he has some originals, turns back to the piano and starts playing the most incredible music the owner has ever heard. He's never been so moved in his life. As the song wraps up, the owner says, ""I've never heard anything like that! What's that piece called?""

The pianist says, ""I call that one, *I Love You So Fucking Much I Could Shit*.""

The owner is taken aback, but asks if the pianist has any others. The pianist turns back to the piano and plays an even more incredible piece than the last one. The owner is quite literally moved to tears. No longer able to stop himself from applauding, he asks, ""What do you call that one?""

""That one's, *I Want to Dick Punch You in the Fart Box*.""

The owner's heard enough, and says, with some trepidation, ""OK, you've got the gig, on one condition: you can't speak to ANY of the patrons.""

The pianist graciously accepts.
___

On the night of the grand opening, the pianist shows up and starts playing, and is predictably amazing. The patrons are loving the music, the drinks are flowing, it's everything the owner was hoping it would be.

After a while, the pianist takes 5 and heads to the bathroom. On his way back, one of the patrons stops him and says, ""Do you know your fly's open and your dick's hanging out?""

The pianist replies incredulously, ""Know it? I wrote it!""",A man is opening up a new piano bar...,15

He started a new job and his coworker told him about this genius doctor that has not met a condition he couldn't fix. Desperate John decides to give this doctor a final try if only for a minuscule hope.

He comes to the doctor and starts. 

D-d-d-d-d-d-doc-tor  i-i-i-i-i've b-b-b-b-b-b-been s-s-s-s-stuttering m-m-m-my wh-wh-wh-ole l-l-l-l-life a-a-a-a-and y-y-y-y-you-you-you're m-m-m-m-my l-l-l-l--last ho-ho-ho-hope. 

The doctor is very assuring and says that he's the best doctor in the world and he will find what's wrong with John. So they begin with the tests and in a week time doctor calls John back to his office. 

John comes back to the doctors office and asks him: S-s-s-s-so d-d-d-doc-doc-doctor w-w-wh-what's w-w-w-wrong w-w-w-wh-whit m-m-m-me?

The doc tells him he has a good news and a not so good news. John is scared and relived but tells the doc to g-g-g-go a-a-a-a-ahead.

So doctor goes. The good news is i know what's causing your stutter. It's your penis. It's so big it messes with your nerves connection in your brains and you stutter. The not so good news is that to stop this we would have to find an organ donor and have your penis replaced with the donors one. 

John is a bit scarred but decides that he has enough of stutter and wants the surgery done as soon as the right donor is found.

In a another week time John gets a call from the doctor that the donor was found and John comes and gets the operation done. 

Several weeks pass and John comes back to the doctors office and says: 

Well doc you were correct. Ever since the operation i had not stutter once. There is just one problem. My wife is really unhappy with the size of my new penis and is threatening divorce because i can't sexually satisfy her anymore. I just need to know what happened to my penis. Can i get it back. I hate to stutter but i love my wife and i want to make her happy.

And the doc goes:

I-i-i-i-i-i'm s-s-s-s-s-so-so-sorry J-j-j-j-john b-b-b-b-b-b-but y-y-y-y-y-y-your p-p-p-p-p-p-pen-penis w-w-w-w-was d-d-d-d-d-d-des-des-destroyed. ",John was stuttering his whole life,153

At the base of the tree, a cat is watching all this unfold and hungrily says: "" I'll be damned if I don't eat this hawk. But I will wait until the hawk has eaten the sparrow so that I can go and fill my belly."" and then waits for the right moment to jump on the hawk.

A few moment pass and the bud starts to bloom. Seeing this, the caterpillar goes and rushes for the bud, devouring the flower that started to bloom.
Not wanting to miss his chance, the sparrow dives and goes for the caterpillar, eating it whole.
With piercing eyes, the hawk reacts fast and swoops down on the sparrow, killing it with a swift strike.
Having been preparing for a deadly attack on the hawk, the cat leaps on the branch and attempts to maul its prey.

This became the distinguishable feature to determine which boy was which. 

As the boys grew older they maintained their popularity and strived in academics and sports as usual, but Jesse got himself involved with some bad apples that significantly lowered his performance in school and sports. He was partying everynight, getting drunk and high constantly. James and his parents tried fixing him but he was being a defiant teen. When the boys finished high school James went on to college but Jesse stayed home for a year until he was kicked out. 

James was very successful in college, and landed  an internship in a very large company.  Every year when the boys would come home for holidays James would come by with gifts for all his relatives and would be dressed in expensive suit coats, Where as Jesse would come in old ratty clothes and would just stay in his room and make a mess. Eventually they told Jesse that he can’t come to family events if he continues to be rude or if he landed a stable job. Jesse left without saying a word.

Throughout the years James became more and more successful and eventually became the owner of a large and successful business, while Jesse was still unheard of for many years.

The men nod and go off to find their respective fruits, and shortly after, the first of the group returns with an armful of oranges. The Devil tells the man ""The rules are simple: if you can fit all 10 of these up your ass, I'll return you to life with all of the wealth and happiness you could imagine, fail to do this and you will burn in Hell for all eternity."" The man, slightly confused but otherwise agreeing begins the ordeal. He very painfully gets half of the first orange up his ass, before bursting out laughing and dropping it. The Devil then snaps his fingers and the man disappears in a cloud of smoke.

The second man returns shortly after, clutching a bundle of strawberries. The Devil repeats the rules and the man nods along and begins in the act. The man is able to fit 5 of the strawberries into his ass and is working on the 6th, when he suddenly bursts out laughing, causing his work to be ruined. The devil snaps his fingers while shaking his head in disappointment and again the man disappears in a cloud of smoke.

The third man approaches shortly after, holding 10 small grapes. The Devil once again recites the rules and the man confidently accepts the bargain, proud of his choice in fruit. The man closes his eyes to concentrate and gets 9 of the grapes up his ass and almost finishes the 10th before he opens his eyes just to see the look on the Devil's soon to be defeated face, when he goes into a fit of laughter, falling down in the process and failing the challenge.

The Devil is beyond pissed at this point and pulls the man up by his collar, yelling ""What is so god-damn funny that you would get this close to besting me, then ruin it for a quick laugh?!"" The man, still chuckling, points to the garden behind the Devil and says: ""That guy's picking pineapples!""",Four men all die simultaneously and appear before the Devil in the Garden of Eden,139

After class he maneuvered the halls to her locker, where he found 5 guys lined up to talk to her, presumably to ask her to prom. But that didn't deter Jim, as he knew it was now or never. So he waited for a couple minutes for the guys to clear up, listening to hear them all get rejected. Sure enough, the time comes and he asks her to Prom, and lo and behold she says Yes! Over the moon, He promises it will be the most amazing date ever, and that she won't regret this. 

Over the next couple days he starts making plans. He eventually decides to go with a limo, a dozen roses, and some doves to be released as they get out of the limo.

With a month left till Prom, he goes to the local tailor to rent a tux, but is dismayed to see how busy it is at the rental space. ""I shouldn't have waited so long!"" He thought. But that didn't stop him. He stood in line for over 2 hours but he left with the tux he wanted. 

The next week, he went to a limousine and town car rental agency. He was blown away with How many people were there. But he didn't let it bring him down, he needed to impress Sally, and the three hours of waiting in line was totally worth it. And he did just that!

Next on his list is doves. He wasn't quite sure where to borrow doves from, so he googled it, and all he could find was a bird sanctuary nearby. So he stopped in the next day, and bit of course. It's national bird watching day! The place was lined up out the door. But he waited, because if there were no doves, he was just another loser with a limo like everyone else. And sure enough, he got to the front desk and told him about his date and how he wanted it to be perfect. The lady at the desk thought it was the cures story ever, so she struck him a deal. ""We have some doves here, in fact we are a little overrun, so you could have a dozen for free!"" Jimmy was ecstatic! He thanked her profusely and went on his way.

With two days left till Prom, Jimmy went to the florist to get a dozen of the best roses, but arrived to see the place swarmed with other guys all there waiting in line to get  flowers for their dates. Jimmy had expected to be busy, but he was astounded that he had to wait in line from 4pm till almost 8:30pm! But he was determined to make it the very best date ever. As he approached the counter, he asked for 1 dozen roses, and as luck would have it, the lady pulled out the last dozen roses, and they were perfect! Everything was set! Prom would be amazing!

The night came and Jimmy could hardly contain himself. He rode in the limo and picked up Sally from her house, and gave her the flowers. She was beautiful! As they rounded the corner to Prom, there was a huge line of cars dropping people off, but this time Jimmy didn't care about having to wait! He was with Sally having an absolute blast. Eventually the line moved forward enough that they got out, and two of Jimmy friends let out the doves as they stepped out of the limo! ""Perfect"" Jimmy thought.  

The night went off without a problem, and Jimmy and Sally were having the time of their life dancing, and stopped for a quick break, and Jimmy ask Sally if he could get her anything? Snacks? A drink maybe? ""A drink,"" she replied, ""I'm sooo thirsty!"" So Jimmy hurried off to fetch her some juice!

To his joy, he found there was no punch line.",Prom night,0

Upon arrival at the castle where the king resided, the guard at the main entrance asked him: ""Wait a minute! who are you?"" ""I am the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""I want to marry the daughter of the king!""
""Oh good luck mate, the king is that way!""

The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse walks in the direction the guard pointed him, but he can't find the king. So he asks another guard where he could find him. 
""Wait a minute! who are you?"" Says the guard. ""I am the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""I want to marry the daughter of the king!""
""Oh good luck mate, the king is that way!""

Finally, after a long search the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse finds the room where the king sees his nobility.
Before he can enter, a guard stops him. ""Wait a minute!"" He says.  ""Who are you?"" ""I am the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""I want to marry the daughter of the king!""
""Oh good luck mate, the king will see you in a minute!""

After standing in line to see the king for over an hour, it's finally the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse's turn. 
""Who are you?"" Asks the king our noble hero. ""I am the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""I want to marry your daughter!""
""Only he who slays the three headed dragon will I give my daughter's hand!""

And so the quest of the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse starts. After a few days of preparation he sets off to the woods where it is said that the dragon has its lair.

After hours of sneaking through the woods, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse feels a heavy breathing in his neck. He turns around and shouts ""Who is there!"" Initially he doesn't get any answer, but after a while a deep voice coming from the woods says: ""Who are you?"" ""I..I..I..... am the re..red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""I want to marry the daughter of the king, but I can only do so after I've defeated you!"" And right at that moment the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse spots a head and chops it right off.


Unfortunately this does not make the dragon die, and even more frustrating is that the three heads do not communicate with each other, so he has to explain who he is and what he is doing for two more times. 


Eventually the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse manages to slay the beast, and he proudly returns to the king.


The king however sees so many nobles and servants each day that he can impossibly remember all of them. So therefore he asks the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse: 

""Who are you?"" ""I am the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
- ""Who?""
- "" The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse!"" 
- ""Oh, the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse?""
- ""Yes. The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse""
""What are you doing here?"" asks the guard, to which the red-blue knight on the red-blue horse answered: ""You told me that I could marry your daughter after I would've slayed the three headed dragon, so now I want to marry your daughter!” 


“But my dear knight” says the king, “I do not have a daughter…”",The red-blue knight on the red-blue horse,1

Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
The butcher follows, dumbstruck.
As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.
He does this again and again. No answer.
So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.

He kneels down beside her and asks if she is okay. 

“I’m fine, it’s just I have been sleeping rough for weeks, I’m freezing cold and haven’t had a hot bath in ages.” She replies. 

The man feeling sympathetic invites her to his apartment a few blocks away. He draws her a bath soon later, the woman comes out smiling “Thanks very much” the lady says, “that was just what I needed.” 

She changes back into her clothes and as she is about to leave her stomach rumbles. 

“Are you okay?” The man asks. 

“Well it’s just I haven’t had a hot meal in weeks.”  The lady replied with a frown. 

On hearing this, the man decides to treat this poor woman to the most luxurious restaurant in town. He tells her to not hold back and order anything she wants. The lady taking advantage of the opportunity orders two appetisers, the 24oz Steak and multiple sides. 

After finishing as much of the food as she possibly could, she is blown away by the man’s generosity. 

She is completely full and gives a grin across the table after she finishes her dessert. 

“Everything okay?” He smiled back. 

“Yes, that was just perfect. You know what else I haven’t had in months, a good kiss.” she replied. 

On hearing this the man leans forward and gives her a kiss. 

She is blown away and says “Thanks for this perfect evening, but there is just one more thing missing.” 

“Oh yeah, what’s that?” He asks with a grin. 

“Well... I haven’t been fucked in months.” She exclaimed seductively. 

He smiles, drops the bill on the table, makes his way to the exit and says... “Well your fucked now”.

A week later Aifur Gott wants to go to the bar again, but this time he’s got $100.

He wakes up and she wants some money to leave, so he gives her the rest and she’s gone.

They rent a limo, and ride it down to the casino. The minibar is cool, well stocked and they get their pre-game on. When they get to the casino, the driver asks Aifur for a tip. “Money’s tight, even as a limo driver, you’ll tip well?” he asks, and Aifur tosses him a $100, since it ain’t really his money. 

Outside the casino is a nun, shaking a collection can and warning people that drinking and gambling are sins. Aifur grins and asks her “have you ever had a drink, sister?”. She says no. “Then how can you condemn it?” asks his uncle, and Aifur offers to bring her a drink. She agrees, but asks for it in a tea cup so no one knows she’s drinking alcohol. He agrees and they go inside. 

For a while Aifur and his Uncle are having a great time, gambling, boozin, smoochin’ women for luck and getting handfuls of ass. Then Aifur remembers the nun, goes to the bar and asks for a bit of whiskey in a tea cup. The bartender pours it and gives it to him, he goes outside and gives it to the nun.

Pathetic if you ask me, letting all those people down whod travelled across the world to see him. The city itself is cramped and smelly, what a waste of money it is to go there"" replied the barber. ""Who are you flying with?""

""British airways, from Birmingham"" said the man.

""What a farse of a company they are! The hostesses are rude and their food gave me diarrhoea! Birmingham is a horrible city anyway, and the airport is tiny and dirty.Where is it you're staying?""

""The Marriott in Rome.""

""I satyed there. The wallpaper was peeling, the terrible service, and my sheets hadn't been changed in weeks!"" Exclaimed the barber. 

""That should be a fun trip"" he remarked sarcastically. ""Let me know how it goes anyway"". 

The man leaves, and walks in again a fortnight later.

""How was it then?"" The barber asks as the man enters.

""Unbelievable! The flight landed ahead of time and I had a gorgeous hostess waiting on me hand and foot. The food was amazing on the flight there, I couldn't believe it."" The man replies.

""Hm, they must have changed something since I went. I bet the hotel was a disappointment?"" The barber asks with a smirk.

""The whitest sheets I've seen, and room service took only a couple of minutes to bring up food and wine for me. They'd just finished renovating, and everything looked fantastic, with freshly painted walls and fancy leather armchairs in the rooms.""

""Did you get to see the pope then?"" The barber asks, disgruntled.

""Once I'd gotten into the Vatican a pair of Swiss guards approached me, explaining that now and again the pope likes to personally meet people visiting the city, and they asked if I was interested. I naturally said yes and when I met the pope he ws so nice! We chatted about the faith and our beliefs, but it was his humility I admired most.""

""Well,"" the barber says, ""it was probably only a face he puts on for meeting the public, behind closed doors I bet he's the worst kind of sinner. How they ever let him become Pope I don't know.""

""There was one thing he mentioned to me  though which caught me off guard"" says the man. ""He said, ""who's cut your hair? It's shit!""""

Terrified, the man does as he's told, climbs down from his bar stool and gets down on his knees in front of the huge black man. The black man unzips his pants and continues: ""Start sucking."". So the man reluctantly starts sucking off the black man.
""Faster."", says the black man, so the man starts going faster. ""Even faster."", says the black man, and the man starts going even faster. ""Go faster!"" goes the black man, and the man sucks as fast as he possibly can, still terrified. ""Go faster!"", the black man shouts. The man looks up and says: ""I can't go faster! Why do you want me to go so fast?"" The black guy responds: ""You need to hurry up, the black knight is coming soon."".",A man walks into a bar,15

The doctor tells the dwarf to lie on the examination bed, and takes a look at her genitals. 

""Yes, I can see why, but luckily it can be fixed easily."" 

The doctor pulls out a big scissor, the female dwarf turns pale, jumps down from the table and hurries out. ""It's not THAT bad!""

Now, a couple weeks go by, where it's raining quite a bit, and the female dwarf finally returns to the doctor. 

""Alright, the itching has gotten worse, and I need to have it fixed.""

The dwarf lies butt naked on the examination bed once more, and the doctor pulls out the big scissor. 

The dwarf woman turns visibly pale, her courage fades and she ends up running off once again. 

Now, the following three weeks are like the monsoon, it's raining every day. The dwarf is itching and itching... until the point where she almost loses it. Eventually she returns to the doctor. 

""Okay, bring out your big scissor, and do what you have to do. I can't handle the itching in my crotch anymore!""

She climbs the examination bed, flashes her delicates and closes her eyes, preparing for the worst. 

The doctor quickly brings out the scissor. 

 - Snip snip - 

The dwarf looks up at the doctor, confused. 

""That didn't even hurt! What did you do?""

""I just cut off two inches of your rubber boots.""

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner. However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited: Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour!

“I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from his employer; had an affair with his boss’s wife; had sex with his boss’s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.

I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.”

Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:

“I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,” said the politician. “In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.”",A Priest was being honoured at his retirement dinner.....,418

A Parsi  couple made a deal that whoever died first would come back and inform the other if there was sex after death.

Their biggest fear was that there was no after life at all. 

After a long life together, the husband was the first to die. 

True to his word, he made the first contact: 

*""Manijeh........Manijeh,*
*Is that you, Dara?""*

*""Yes, I've come back like we agreed.""* 

*""That's wonderful. What's it like?""*

*""Well, I get up in the morning, I have sex. I have breakfast and then it's off to the golf course. I have sex again, bathe in the warm sun and then have sex a couple of more times.*

*Then I have lunch (you'd be proud - lots of greens). Another romp around the golf course, then pretty much have sex the rest of the afternoon. After supper, it's back to the golf course again. Then it's more sex until late at night. I catch some much needed sleep and then the next day it starts all over again.""*

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, so he decided to start walking.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sunblock and pours his windshield wiper fluid into a water bottle in case he gets that desperate, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's walked about 30 miles. That means that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He tells himself that he's got to be close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of the dunes, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday, or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick.

After a while of walking, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it. He's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a couple sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance. He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is, so he just keeps crawling.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down, just imagining the whole thing.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

Crawling, he would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He leans back to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again - better.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post sticking up out of the stone at an angle. And wrapped around the post, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. Maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were nearby.

He shakily pulls the bottle of wiper fluid out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real?”

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you are. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. You can call me Nate, if you wish.""

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson.""

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for.”

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. So technically you’re always dying"" Nate seemed very amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.""

""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack said.

“with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, or give any information about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes to yourself. They're like wishes but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd live a very long time, barring accidents, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well.”

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size.”

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?""

""Just talk,""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second. ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate skeptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the trunk to reach out across the stone.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here.

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least,"" nate said.

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""Maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psycho to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psycho, because it would kill him too. Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, ""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. As much as you can give” Jack turned to face away from Nate, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now, Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's ""Just Kidding!"" right before he felt the now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.

Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone listening to the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been recently bitten.

Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever, his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he was still awake.

Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.

""Nate, do accidents count?""

Nate lifted his head a little bit. ""What do you mean, Jack?""

Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. ""You know, accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does that still wipe out humanity?""

""Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that if you start feeling wobbly,"" said Nate with some amusement.

""Wow,"" said Jack as he leaned back until only his elbows kept him off of the stone and looked up into the sky.

""Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too, right?"" asked Jack.

""Yes,"" replied Nate, ""it was. He lived 167 years, Jack.""

""Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long. Do you know what he died of, Nate?""

""He died of getting tired of living, Jack,"" Nate said, sounding somewhat sad.

Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.

""His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in. He didn't stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he told me he'd had enough. It was his time.""

""And then he just died?"" asked Jack.

Nate shook his head a little. ""He made his forth request, Jack. There's only one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.

After a bit Nate continued, ""He told me that he was tired, that it was his time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always had.

After another pause, Nate finished, ""Samuel's body disappeared off the stone with the sunrise.""

Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.

Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long walk back to town.

Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day, and within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV. They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without incident.

Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a bookstore, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see Nate.

Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then started walking. Jack had brought more books for Nate. He spent the weekend with Nate, and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but that he had things to do first.

Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger, special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot rattlesnake would be able to use. After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.

Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote, and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started traveling around the country for book signings and readings.

On one of the visits Nate, Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's silence, sat down and waited.

After a few minutes, Nate spoke. ""Jack, I have someone to introduce you to.""

Jack looked surprised. ""Someone to introduce me to?"" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. ""This something to do with the Big Guy?

""No, no,"" replied Nate. ""This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."" Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. ""Sammy!""

Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the dune and up to the lever.

""Yo, Jack,"" said the new, much smaller snake.

""Yo, Sammy"" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. ""Named after Samuel, I assume?""

Nate nodded. ""Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around for me?"" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the edge of the stone and looked across the sands. ""When Samuel first told me about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I want my son to have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been. Think you can do that for me, Jack?""

Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. ""Yeah, I can do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?"" Jack could sense that was something more.

Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said, ""Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet ya!"" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.

Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. ""Jack, this is my first son, and I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I needed a replacement.""

Jack considered this for a minute. ""So, you're ready to come see the world, and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?""

Nate shook his head. ""No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die.""

Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said was, ""What do you want me to do?""

Nate nodded. ""Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.

""I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now. I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be able to die. And I need you to kill me.

""I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword. it should work, even on me.

""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that.""

Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy! Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack.""

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then headed into the desert with Sammy following.

Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through e-mail. They made a goal of visiting every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Jack managed to keep the talking rattlesnake hidden. When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was stalling. So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from his dad. It was time to head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage, he loaded up Sammy, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they drove.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing traction.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate, waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't working. In a split second, Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the lever he’d have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer away. He'd have to time his turn just right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate was off to the side of the lever, but still on the stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever, and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone. Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""Better Nate than lever!"", he ran over the snake.","So, there's a man crawling through the desert...",4
