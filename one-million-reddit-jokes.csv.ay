The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.

""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""","The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office.

The guy resigned himself to death and agreed. The witch cast her voodoo on him and said that in the morning, when the child wakes up it would be able to see once more, but the father would never again wake up.

So the guy goes to a bar and drinks himself out.

The next morning he wakes up on the bar and immediately rushes home. His wife greets him at the door:

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?"" Asks the replacement. ""And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

Conscious, grumbling: “ I guess I am now”

“Ya know, I was thinking……..”

“No shit, maybe you should fucking be sleeping”

“ Wait, hear me out, How many great grandparents would you have if you went back say 1000 or more years?”

“Are you fucking serious?” a different subconscious silently curses Northeastern University’s Engineering Dept, “that’s what your thinking about?”

Then, Conscious makes a foggy mistake.

“What time is IT!?”

The Ghost of Steve Jobs smirks an evil smirk: “Grab your iphone and check”

Before anyone can stop him, Hand, like a golden retriever puppy, lurches out, and knocks over the water bottle.

“Shit!” says Conscious

Hand fumbles on nightstand still half asleep…..

Eyes: “NOOO, don’t look at the , AHHHHHH…” White laser light blasts the retinas.

“What the fuck! It’s 3:02 am! Put the phone down!” Conscious yells.

Hand, like a typical teen getting reprimanded, puts the phone down “What? I was just checking it for a second, you’re always yelling at me”

“Shut up hand, go adjust Scrotum, he’s stuck to Thigh”

Kidney chimes in sounding like he’s drowning: “Excuse me, I gotta go pee”

Morning Wood resting firmly against his favorite buttocky pillow: “Not till I’m done”

“Is she sleeping?” Conscious asks, suddenly oblivious to everything else.

Ear, metaphorically rolling his eyes “You can’t hear that snoring?”

“What ssssnoring?” Morning wood says, sounding like a snake offering Conscious an apple.

“Listen you two, I gotta go, like now.” says Kidney with authority.

Shoulder: “Hey I’m cold, Hand, would you grab the covers?”

Hand, who all through this has been giving a good massage, reluctantly releases the Testicle Twins and obliges.

Subconscious “Hey, What if we went back to 3000 years? Man, that’s an exponential shit load of great grandparents we might need a ….

Sphincter, Coughs.

There is a pregnant silence.

Nose: “Seriously dude? Have you been eating off the raccoon’s truck in the Geico commercial?”

Everyone giggles.

Subconscious: “ Those commercials are pretty funny! I wonder how much…..”

He’s cut off by Conscious “Shut. Up.”

Kidney:”Hey, Morning Wood has left his post. Let’s go”

Feet, acting like a toddler’s first step, search for Slippers.

Morning wood, blocked by kidney, shouts: “Hey, if we knock over the water bottle again, maybe we can get her to stir?”

“We can’t see!” feet interrupts.

Hand shoots for the iPhone.

Steve Job’s Ghost snickers.

As conscious heads to the bathroom with everyone in tow, he sees Coffee Pot in the glow of the night light.

She’s seductively sitting on the counter like a Colombian hooker. Beckoning.

Subconscious: “Hey, where’s the calculator?……..”",3:02 AM,1

So life was hard after the war, and the world was slowly recovering. Like other war veteran, Eps was suffering from PTSD. That would affect his mental life sometimes. And it was bothering his neighbour who was a german refugee named Himmer, or Him for short.

Christmas of that year, Himmer was decorating his tree. This time he bought some elves’ statues. When Eps was walking back from the bar to his porch, he suddenly saw these elves. One particular elf triggerd Eps as its ressembled an old german soldier. His PTSD attacked and Eps ran to his room and took his gun, then sprayed all over Hims’ garden.

Police arrived shortly after. When journalists were interviewing the chief police if someone was killed, he giggled:

“Well, Eps’ Sten killed Him’s elf.”",The oldman's PTSD,2

Well, this was not good news to the cardinals, who argued about it at length. Finally they went to the pope with the doctor and explained the situation. After some thought,the pope stated, “I agree but under four conditions.”

The cardinals were amazed and there arose quite an uproar. Over all of the noise there arose a single voice that asked, “And what are the four conditions?”

The room stilled. There was a long pause. The pope replied, “First the girl must be blind, so that she cannot see with whom she is having sex.

“Second, she must be deaf, so that she cannot hear with whom she is having sex.

“And third she must be dumb so that if somehow she figures out with who she is having sex, she can tell no one.”

""More people"" he said as he saw it still not working. So at that point, I got my son and daughter to help as well but still no luck

""Many more."" He said. Luckily the neighbours were home and after a quick discussion with them I had the whole clan from next door over to help. In total there were now 11 people, plus the maintenance man in the lounge. 

At this point the maintenance man tells me to get everyone to touch the switch and to try it again and sure enough, it worked. I was flabbergasted and asked how and why this had worked now where it wouldn't before with just myself

Three children always go to their Grandmothers house for Christmas Eve.

Every Christmas Eve their Grandmother would prepare a big bowl of cookie dough that they would all bake cookies with on Christmas morning.

Yet every Christmas morning the grandmother would wake up and notice that all of the cookie dough had been eaten in the middle of the night.

To find out which one of her grandchildren was eating the cookie dough she came up with a plan.

One Christmas eve after the children went to bed she took a bowl of BB'S and mixed it in with the cookie dough.

The next morning her oldest granddaughter came running down the stairs screaming, Grandma, Grandma something horrible has happened!

Her Grandmother said ""What Happened?"" The girl says ""I was upstairs and I got my period and their were BB'S in my tampon!"" her Grandmother said ""I know you've been eating the cookie dough go sit down!""

A few moments later her youngest granddaughter came running down the stairs screaming ""Grandma, Grandma something horrible has happened!""

Her Grandmother said ""What happened?"" the little girl says ""I was pooping and their were BB'S in my poop!"" The grandmother says, ""I know that you've been eating the cookie dough go sit down!""

A few moments later her grandson came running into the room screaming ""Grandma, Grandma something Horrible has happened!""

His grandmother said ""What happened?""

The boy says ""I was Jerking off in the garage and I shot the cat!""",BB'S In The Cookie Dough,4

Two trees are growing up side by side in the forest one is a birch tree, and one is a beech tree. They are so conceited, theyrarely noticed the rest of the forest around them. Until one day, they look down and notice a young sapling growing up between them. One asks the other, is this the son of a birch, or a son of a beech? Neither of them knew, but as luck would have it, a woodpecker floated in and landed on the young sapling. So they asked him, is this the son of a birch or is it the son of a beech? The woodpecker said, one moment gentlemen. And then he tapped on the sapling for a moment, and then munched the fibers in his mouth. Then he looked up to the two trees and said I am sorry to tell you gentlemen this is neither the son of a birch, nor is it the son of a beech. It is however, the very best piece of ash I have ever had my pecker in!

I do not proclaim to be the originator of this joke. It is just the best joke I know, and whenever I tell it, people laugh like crazy. As I have been following this subreddit for a while, I have never seen this one reposted, and this subreddit seems to be ripe with reposts. I hope you enjoyed it.

post,etzem7,2qh72,jokes,false,1579999152,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/etzem7/career_choices/,self.jokes,,"As a child, I thought about being a musician, but all my efforts fell flat.

In High School, my teachers seemed to be pushing a career as an astronaut, but then I realized they had something else in mind when they said I was “a real space cadet.”  


My first job was working in an orange juice factory, but I got canned because I couldn’t concentrate.  


Then I worked in the woods as a lumberjack, but I couldn’t hack it, so they gave me the axe.

I had hopes of being a professional Bridge player, but I had no finesse so they shuffled me out the door.

Next, I became a personal trainer, but was asked to leave because I wasn’t working out.

I tried working in a muffler factory, but I found that too exhausting.

So, I attempted to be a deli worker, but any way I sliced it, I couldn’t cut the mustard.

I studied a long time to become a doctor, but in the end I didn’t have the patients for it.

Next was a job in a shoe factory.  I tried, I really did, but I just didn’t fit in.

As a professional fisherman, I couldn’t catch on and hence I couldn’t live on my net income.

So I tried computer software, but couldn’t get with the program.

I thought I might be one of those professional eaters—pies, hot dogs, and the like—but I didn’t have the stomach for it.

After many years of trying to find steady work, I finally got a job as a historian—until I realized there was no future in it.

I was beginning to feel like my grandfather who was an executioner in the old West.  He could never get the hang of it, so they cut him loose.

My last job was working in Starbucks, but I eventually quit because it was always the same old grind.

So I tried retirement, and you know what?  I’m perfect for the job.",Career Choices,7

The man reaches into the bag and pulls out a little man, about 9 inches high and sets him on the counter.

He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench, which he places in front of the piano. The little man sits down at the piano, and starts playing a beautiful Piece by Mozart!

""Where on earth did you get that?"" says the bartender.

The man responds by reaching into the paper bag. This time he pulls out a magic lamp.

He hands it to the bartender and says, ""Here. Rub it.""

So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there's a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him.

""I will grant you one wish.. Just one wish.... each person is only allowed one!""

The bartender gets real excited. Without hesitating he says, ""I want A million bucks!""

A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. It is soon followed by another duck, then another. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!

The bartender turns to the man and says, ""You know, I think your Genie's' a little deaf. I asked for a million bucks, not a million Ducks.""

""No shit!!"" says the man, ""do you really think I asked for a 9 inch pianist?""",Aman walks into a bar...,16

It seems so easy, so I thought I'd pass it on to some of my younger friends. The article suggested doing it three days a week.

Begin by standing on a comfortable surface, where you have plenty of room at each side.

With a 5-lb. potato sack in each hand, extend your arms straight out from your sides, and hold them there as long as you can. Try to reach a full minute, then relax.

Each day, you'll find that you can hold this position for just a bit longer.

After a couple of weeks, move up to 10-lb. potato sacks.

Then 50-lb. potato sacks, and eventually try to get to where you can lift a 100-lb. potato sack in each hand and hold your arms straight for more than a full minute.

After you feel confident at that level, put a potato in each of the sacks; but be careful.",Exercise for seniors,11

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope
and listened to the duck’s
chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head
sadly and said, “I’m sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has
passed away.”

The distressed woman wailed, “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am sure. The duck is dead,”
replied Dr.Santa.

“How can you be so sure?” she protested.
“I mean you haven’t done any testing
on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.”

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left
the room.

He returned a few minutes later with a Labrador.
As the duck’s owner looked on in amazement,
the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the
examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom.
He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and
shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it
out of the room.

A few minutes later he returned with a cat.
The cat jumped on the table and also delicately
sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its
haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of
the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said,
“I’m sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely,
100% certifiably, a dead duck.”

Dr.Santa turned to his computer terminal, hit a
few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.
The duck’s owner, still in shock, took the
bill. “$150!” she cried, “$150 just to tell
me my duck is dead!”

The vet shrugged, “I’m sorry. If you had just taken my word for it,
the bill would have been $10, but with the Lab Report and the
Cat Scan, it’s now $150.”","A woman brought a very limp duck to Dr.Santa, a veterinary surgeon.",324

""Hold on a minute!"" said the Pope, “You can't do that - you'll destroy the reputation of the Church!"".  ""This is my lottery win"", said the photographer, ""I'll be financially secure for the rest of my life with these photos!""  So, the Pope offered to buy the camera from the photographer, and after much negotiation, they eventually settled on a figure of $2,000,000.  The Pope clothed himself and headed off to destroy the images on the camera.  Along the vast Vatican hallways, he bumped into his personal housekeeper.  Being a bit of a photography buff, she noticed the camera and said, ""That looks like a really expensive digital SLR camera, how much did it cost you?""  Not being one to lie, the Pope replied, ""Two million Dollars..""  ""TWO MILLION Dollars!"" replied the housekeeper, ""Wow! They must have seen you coming!""",Pope taking a shower!,12

post,etqg7d,2qh72,jokes,false,1579956941,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/etqg7d/6_life_lessons/,self.jokes,,"**Lesson 1:**

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

“Who was that?” “It was Bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”

*Moral of the story:*

Always let your boss have the first say

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,”Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest apologized “Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”

*Moral of the story:*

If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ”Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” The crow answered: “Sure, why not.” So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

*Moral of the story:*

To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull “I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but I haven’t got the energy.” “Well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “They’re packed with nutrients.” The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it wont keep you there

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy
2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend
3. And when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!",6 life lessons,14906

The tiger looks at his beer, looks at the rabbit, and back his beer. He takes a claw and cracks open the beer and proceeds to carefully place it down beside him. He gets up and walks over to the rabbit, lifts up a paw, and starts mauling the shit out of this rabbit!

The giraffe and sheep are in shock. And they say, ""Dude, what the fuck? He was just trying to help you!""

We started some easy standing poses but as soon as we got to the floor poses it started to hurt. With each pose my panties were travelling deeper and deeper into my crack. The yogi then said “Class. We will start our meditation by  envisioning ourselves on a bridge gazing at the water...” all I could envision was getting these panties out of my ass so I seized the moment while everyone’s eyes were closed and went excavating for the thong gone wrong. 

After class was over the yoga teacher locked eyes with me beckoned me to come over. When the class emptied he said, “When you can move a river between two mountains without hands, you will have peace.”

In case it's been a while since you've seen Disney's Animated Mulan:

Mulan - Daughter of a war veteran  who steals her father's armor and takes his place in the army as a boy named Ping

General Shang - Captain of a squadron of new recruits

Chien-Po - A new recruit in the army. Tall, Fat, loves food

Yao - A new recruit in the army. Short, Short-tempered, short on brain cells

Ling - A new recruit in the army. Medium height, skinny, likes jokes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao, and Ling were getting lazy sitting around after defeating the Huns. So General Shang decided to throw them back into training camp. But this time he sent them on quests around the world.  

Yao proposed that they should make all his challenges into a competition and whoever wins the most gets to sit next to the emperor at the next Chinese New Year's celebration.   

First, they had to retrieve an arrow from the top of a giant Sequoia tree in California while carrying heavy amulets. Much like the original training camp Mulan's ingenuity allowed her to win that challenge.  

To be as swift as a coursing river they had to swim across the Amazon river. Ling with his streamlined body slithered to first.   

To have the force of a great typhoon. They had to protect a house in a Phillipino village for the month of August. While most of them ran around being buffeted by the winds. Chien-Po literally just sat in front of his house and all flying objects bounced off him. Earning him a victory.  

To have the strength of a raging fire they tight roped across the Sakurajima volcano in Japan. Yao was angry at this point and fireballed across the rope (literally he may have gotten singed but he finally had a win under his belt).  

With one win each, they entered the final challenge. Mysterious as the dark side of the moon. They had to go to Antarctica and disappear into the wildlife.  

 Ling painted a box white and hid inside it.  

Yao covered himself in white furs and lumbered around on all fours.  

Chien-Po flopped around on the beach.  

Mulan changed into her father's armor, sliced her hair off again and marched deep into the heart of Antarctica.   

General Shang arrived to judge who fulfilled the task best.  As soon as he stepped off the boat he saw a shivering 6'tall cardboard box.   

""Ling! That is the lowest effort ice block there is! Eliminated!!""  

Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a bear chomping on some fish.  

""Yao! There are no polar bears in Antarctica! Disqualified!"" 

When the leopard seals slid into the icy waters. They left behind someone with blubber - but not quite enough.  

""Chien-Po solid effort but you still missed the mark!""  

Next, they followed footprints into the heart of Antarctica until they reached an Emperor colony. At the heart stood a male figure 2 feet taller than the birds. 

""Mulan! You're clearly not blending into those puffins!! You lose! "" 

""No. Ping win.""","Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao, and Ling were getting lazy sitting around after defeating the Huns",0

""You talk?"" he asks.

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when  I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA.

He is greeted by the bartender who promptly asks him what he would like to drink. “I’ll take a... I’ll do a Crown and 7-Up,” the man says. The bartender nods his head in acknowledgement, does a quick search under the counter, and produces an apple which he sets in front of his customer. The man is a bit confused and reiterates his order, stating “I asked for a Crown and 7, I’m not very hungry...”
The bartender smirks and tells his patron “Sir, that is what I have given you... go ahead and take a bite.”

The man bites into the apple, and to his amazement it tastes like 7-Up. “Can I have one of these, but with Crown?” the man asks. The bartender smirks again and tells him to turn the apple around. The man does this and is even more amazed that the apple is an edible mixed drink.

A second man walks into the bar, and takes a seat. The bartender greets him, asking what this second customer would like. The man #2 responds with “I’ll have a Jack and coke.” Again, the bartender briefly searches  beneath the counter and produces an apple which he places in front of man #2. “What the fuck is this? I ordered a drink, not a damn apple!”, man #2 says in an irritated manner. The firs customer hears man #2’s dismay, and tells him that he needs to try the apple. Man #2 bites into the apple and smiles once he realizes that the bite he took actually tastes like Jack Daniels. He proceeds to ask for a cola mixer, to which the bartender replies “turn it around”. Man #2’s attitude diminishes, and he sits to enjoy his apple.

Shortly after, a third man walks in and takes a seat between man #1 and man #2. Man #3 is confused that 2 men in a bar are eating apples rather than drinking. He’s so perturbed by this he decides to ask them both, “why the hell are both of you sitting here eating apples instead of enjoying a few drinks?” Man #1, already on his third apple, is excited to share his newfound love of apples with the man sitting next to him, “you tell the bartender what kind of drink you want, and he has an apple with those exact flavors! I’m eating a Crown and 7 right now!” 
In disbelief, man #3 looks at man #1 and call him an idiot and a liar. Man #2 who is on his second apple chimes in, “he’s not lying. I’m enjoying my Jack and coke flavored apple. It’s like he’s got an apple for any flavor you want...”
Man #3 is perplexed and takes a look at the bartender and asks, “is that true?” The bartender only responds with a nod of his head. 
Man #3 decides he wants to show the other two men that it’s some cheap parlor trick. He grins, looks at the bartender and says, “You got any that taste like pussy?”
The bartender doesn’t hesitate, and immediately takes a look beneath the counter. Once again, he produces an apple and sets it in front of man #3. Man # 3 takes a look at the other 2 patrons who are eager for him to share their love for the magical apples. Man #3 takes a bite, expecting it to taste only like an apple. As soon as the bite touches his tongue, he spits it out. “This tastes like shit!”, man # 3 exclaims.
The bartender grins and says “turn it around...”",A man is driving when he notices a new bar has opened up,498

My prospective sister in law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts and generally was Bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me. I always got a nice view. It had to be deliberate, she never did it around anyone else.

One day, she called me and asked to come over. 'To check the wedding invitations' she said. She was alone when i arrived. She whispered to me that she had feelings and desires or me. She couldn't overcome them anymore.She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married. She said ' Before you are commited to my sister'. Well I was in total shock, and I couldn't mutter a word. ""I'm going up to my bedroom, if you want just one last wild fling, just come up and have me"".

I was stunned and frozen in shock as i watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment. Then turned and made a bee-line straight to the front door. As i'm walking to my car, Lord and behold, my entire future family was standing outside clapping! With tears in his eyes my father in law hugged me and said that I had passed the test and couldn't ask for a better man for his daughter.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Once upon a time,24

The guard detains the guy, then rips open the bags.  Nothing but sand.  He even has the sand analyzed... only to find out that it really is just sand, and the sack really is just a plain old sack.

Two days later, the same thing happens.  And then it happens again two days after that.  Every time, the guy guy on the bike is carrying nothing but sand.

This goes on for seven years.

This drives the border guard crazy... like really crazy.  He loses his job because of it.  So, one day, he tracks the Mexican down and says to him:

“I’m no longer a border guard, but I gotta know—What is it that you’re smuggling?  Because I know you’re smuggling something.”

The guy smiles at him and says:

“Bicycles, sucker.”","So, this Mexican guy comes riding up to the border on a bicycle with two big sacks over his shoulders.",18

post,etc3hq,2qh72,jokes,false,1579880768,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/etc3hq/first_time_at_the_barber/,self.jokes,,"I had never been to an actual barber  before yesterday, I've grown my hair and beard out for the past several  years for a few reasons, but mostly because up until a couple weeks ago  I've been too poor to afford regular haircuts. I string enough  jobs together working out of a labor pool to get by, but I struggle to  spend money on things I don't deem absolutely necessary, my personal  appearance being one of them. 

A  deceased relative recently left me a fair sum of cash and being the  type of person I am I wanted to pay it forward while beginning the  process of turning my life around by taking a first step of making  myself presentable again. I stepped into the barber  as a walk-in and got some blank stares from the regulars, nothing I'm  not used to. The guy at the back of the shop came up front and asked if I  was lost or just in desperate need of a haircut, I obliged that it was  the latter. 

He said, 'we generally don't take charity cases here, but I think I can help you out.' 

I  told him I appreciated the kindness, but I do actually have money, but  seeing as how he was going to help me out anyway I asked him if he'd be  willing to make a wager. 

""How much cash we talkin'?"". 

$100. 

""OK my brotha, so what's the wager?"" 

How  about this: I've got $100 here, I just need a hair and beard do to make  me look decent; I've been growing this mop and rat's nest on my head  and face for several years and I just need something to make me look  like I don't live under the 7th street bridge.

""OK, so what's the bet?""

At  this point I don't even know what I look like under here, but I'm  willing to let you help me find out. How about this, you cut my hair and  beard however you see fit. If I like what you do with it you keep the  $100, if I don't like it, then I'm just another charity case.

""BET!""

For an hour I'm in the chair. Wash. Hot towel. Trimmer. Razor. 

Then  came this goo that made my face tingle like those cold winter  nights when my face was still bare, the fire already burned out, is this  the night I freeze? A sweet escape from my choices? No,  that day never came. 

In  that moment, I found myself in the snow, lost in nostalgia of my nightmare, the fear of continual loss, failure, the  burnout I had become. Had I reset to a past moment? Had I fallen back in  time? Was this a chance to make new decisions? 

He spun the  chair and for the first time I saw myself anew. The tears streaming down my face, the emotion of that moment overwhelming my ability to recognize my own reflection.

I touched my face 'what have you done?'

""You don't like it?""

I loved it.

...but I didn't tell him that.

The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed,  saying, ""Hey old man, can you dance?""

The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, ""No son, I don't dance... never really wanted to""

A crowd had gathered as the gunslinger grinned and said, ""Well, you old fool, you're gonna dance now!"" and started shooting at the old man's feet.

The old prospector, not wanting to get a toe blown off, started hopping around like a flea on a hot skillet. 

Everybody standing around was laughing.. 

When his last bullet had been fired, the young gunslinger, still laughing, holstered his gun and turned around to go back into the saloon.

The old man turned to his pack mule, pulled out a double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun and cocked both hammers. 

The loud clicks carried clearly through the desert air. The crowd stopped laughing immediately. 

The young gunslinger heard the sounds too, and he turned around very slowly.

The silence was deafening. The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old timer and the large gaping holes of those twin 12-gauge barrels. 

The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old man's hands, as he quietly said;

""Son, have you ever kissed a mule's ass?""

The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, ""No sir... but.... I've always wanted to""","An old prospector shuffled into the town of El Indio, Texas leading a tired old mule.",182

The ENT doc says “you’re on!” The urologist goes up to the owl, rubs a special spot on its neck and performs the surgery.

The ENT doc notices this and says “ok, double or nothing I can give it a tonsillectomy without it waking up.” The urologist thinks his secret is safe and agrees. The ENT goes up to the owl, does just like the Urologist and does the procedure. 

Later that night the owl is flying with his buddy when his buddy suggests flying down to the ninth hole to check for food. The owl says

“No way! I slept on that branch over there last night and ever since I can’t f$&amp;@ worth a hoot or hoot worth a f$&amp;@!”",A urologist and a ear nose and throat doctor are golfing,7

and happy to be released from his confinement, the genie grants him 3 wishes.

The Irishman thinks about it, and says ""I want me a pint of Guinness that is never empty.""

""So, what would you like for your other two wishes, sir?""

What did she think I had, an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry.

The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish Setter's a$$ and a car hit us both.

I'm writing this slow 'cause I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left. Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't be able to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers with them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address. This place has a washing machine. The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen 'em since. It only rained twice this week, three days the first time and four days the second time. The coat you wanted me to send to you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she comes. About your sister, she had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or a girl so don't know if you are an Aunt or Uncle. But I hear it has your brothers eyes. Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat. Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so he drowned. We cremated him and he burned for three days. Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup. One was driving and the other two were in the back. The driver got out. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. The other 2 drowned. They couldn't get the tail gate down. Not much more news this time. Nothing much happened. If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I will send another one.
