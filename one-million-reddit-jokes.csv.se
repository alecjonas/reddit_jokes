 A eunuch (think Varys from Game of Thrones) was wandering around town.

Back in ancient China, many high ranking jobs had castration as a requirement. 
This particular eunuch was a public official, but was also extremely insecure about his condition. He would throw fits over anything perceived as an insult, and was not liked.

The official eventually came to the house of a writer. He demanded the writer tell him a story involving him, the great official. The writer knew of this eunuch's short fuse, and decided to toy with him.
He began his story after a pause: ""A eunuch was riding on a horse...""


And then stopped.


After another long pause, the eunuch lost his temper and lashed out. ""Why have you stopped? You clearly have not finished the story!""

The writer responded, ""Well, that's the point, isn't it? It cannot *finish*. I doubt it could even start!""

Tell me what happened and I'll let you know if I can let you in.""

""Well I came home early from work because I was suspicious that my wife was cheating on me. I searched the house but there was no one there except her, so I figured I was wrong. I grabbed a snack from the cupboard and went out onto the balcony of my apartment to clear my head, and sure enough, there's this guy hanging by his fingertips from the edge, trying to stay out of sight. So I look around and see a hammer I'd been using the day before. I snatch it up and start hitting away at his fingers. He quickly falls the twenty stories to the ground and I look over the railing in triumph, but the lucky bastard has landed in some bushes and seems stunned but otherwise fine. In a fit of rage I run inside, pick up my fridge with inhuman strength and hurl it over the balcony and it squashes the adulterous asshole dead. Problem was that the exertion had given me a heart attack, and moments later I found myself here.""
St peter looks aghast, ""That is simply horrible, I'm so very sorry. Please, please come in."" And the first man enters in to heaven.

The second man approaches and St Peter gives him the spiel about heaven being full and them only letting in people with tragic deaths.
The second man nods and says, ""I was working out on the balcony of my twenty first floor apartment, which has been having renovations done and the railing was down. Not real smart I suppose, but I didn't want to ruin the new carpet with sweat. Anyway I had just finished a set of push ups when my sweaty hands slipped and I fell off the balcony. Luckily I caught the edge of the balcony one story below but because of my work out I was too tired to pull myself up. I cried out for help but no one seemed to hear. Finally someone came out and I thought I was saved but before I could ask for help the manic grabs a hammer and starts beating on my fingers. I fell to what I thought was my death only to be saved by landing in some bushes below. I was climbing free and thanking my lucky stars when out of nowhere a fridge smashes down crushing my legs and stomach. It took a few minutes of agonizing pain, but eventually I bled to death and woke up here.""
""That's awful,"" says St Peter, ""You'd better go in.""

And so the second man enters into heaven. The third man approaches St Peter who tells him the same as the last two. Heaven is full, tragic death's only. But before he can start, St Peter adds, ""and those last two were absolutely horrible. To get in your story is going to have to be really heart wrenching. I mean we've already filled the daily quota. There is almost no chance I can let you in.""

I'm a 27 year old Lesbian, and I've always thought I'm just a lesbian. 


I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really. I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. 



I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. 




Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing. Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through. I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. 




She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. 




We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. 




I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said ""what are you doing"" ""are you sure, you want this."" I told him ""please, this is what I want"", and then he went with it too. 



I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like ""Damnit Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin you no treefiddy!""",TIFU by sleeping with a guy for the first time,0

He's sat on the grass, chewing on a straw, watching his sheep roam around under the last rays of the setting sun. A jeep leaving behind clouds of dust stops before him, and off gets a businessman clad in an expensive suit and leather shoes with a camera on his hands.

The businessman starts snapping pictures of the surrounding area and, once he's finished, looks at the shepherd with curiosity and asks, ""Is this your land?""

""Aye..."" responds the shepherd.

A look of glee forms in the businessman's eyes as he asks again, ""And are those your sheep?""

""Aye..."" says the shepherd.

""Would you sell some of your land?"" asks the businessman.

The shepherd looks up, studying the businessman with a cautious look, before  searching upon his eyes and asks ""And why would I do that?""

""So you can make some money, and buy more sheep,"" explains the businessman with a smirk.

""And why would I buy more sheep?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can sell their wool, and make more money,"" says the businessman.

""And why would I do that?"" insists the shepherd.

""So you can buy even more sheep, and sell even more wool,"" says the businessman.

""And why would I do that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So, at some point, you can build a factory and fill it with looms,"" says the businessman.

""And why would I do that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can make your wool into clothes, instead of selling it, and make even more money,"" explains the businessman.

The shepherd looks at his sheep for a second, spitting out the chewed straw, and asks, ""And why would I do that?""

""So you can buy more and more sheep, sell more and more clothes, and make more and more money,"" says the businessman, getting giddy at the thought.

""And why would I do that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can be rich!"" offers the businessman.

""And why would I want that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can build yourself a mansion. Right here!"" says the businessman, tapping the ground with his foot.

""And why would I do that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can have a big bedroom. On the top floor! With big windows! And a big balcony!"" says the businessman, his voice increasing in volume.

""And why would I do that?"" asks the shepherd.

""So you can sit back, look over your sheep, enjoy the sunset... Enjoy life!"" says the businessman, practically jumping up with excitement.

The doctor performed a long operation and it was successful. When the teacher woke up, she saw the face of the doctor and smiled.

He also asks for the other hiker's name, but Bob explains she's a stranger.  The sheriff, having formulated a plan, asks the hiker what food they brought.  Bob speaks very softly so as to not alert the bear, saying the name of a candy bar she has in her pocket.

The sheriff asks whether Bob can tell the woman to throw the candy bar she has to distract it.  Bob stops talking, and the sheriff instinctively knows the bear's now extremely close to Bob.  He tells Bob to discreetly pass the phone over to her, saying he will directly tell the woman to throw the candy bar to distract it.

Bob passes the phone over to the woman and she listens to the sheriff's directions.  She then gives back the phone, picks up the baby, and throws it to the bear which quickly devours the poor thing.

""What the hell did he tell you?!"" Bob asks, in complete shock.

The woman, confused, replies ""How did he know my name was Ruth?""

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

There was a very long line, as many other boys were renting tuxedos as well, but he waited patiently because he was so thrilled, and orders his tuxedo. A week passes. Doug realizes he wants to rent a limo for the big night to impress Susan, so he goes to a car rental shop. There's an even longer line and over a hundred people are waiting, but he's so excited that he waits and waits and finally secures his limo reservation. The big day approaches, and Doug can't contain his excitement. He goes to the flower shop to buy a corsage and a boutineer. Every guy in town is already waiting in line, but he patiently goes to the back and waits his turn. Hours pass, and he finally purchases his items. Flower in hand, he goes and picks Susan up for prom. The night is well, and Doug and Susan are having a blast. They're dancing and laughing and having a generally good time, and soon Susan leans in close to Doug and whispers that she'd like a glass of punch. So Doug, bent on getting her a drink, looks over to the drink tables and sees that there's no punch line.",Prom,2

""F**k me or climb the ladder to success"" she says as she raises the hand that was in her pants to her lips.

Not being turned on by this, Peter continues to climb up. He gets up to another cloud and he sees a average looking woman lying on a bed. She too has her hands busy in her panties. 

""F**k me or climb the ladder to success"" she says as she raises one of her hands that was in her pants to her lips.

Peter thinks to himself 'Okay this lady is definitely a lot hotter than the first one. Maybe if I climb up higher on this ladder I would get another one that is significantly hotter than this one' so he climbs up until he gets to the next cloud. 

Once there he sees two super hot super model gorgeous women, both with huge tits, completely naked and they are oiling nd fingering up each other. They notice peter and come walking seductively to him.

""F**k us or climb the ladder to success"" one of them says as she grabs her friends breasts from behind and plays with them for a moment.

Peter thinks to himself, 'Okay these women have been getting hotter and hotter the higher I have climbed. so at the top of this ladder I would be in absolute heaven', then continues to climb up.

He then gets to the very top. but all he sees is a small hut, and once he steps off the ladder to go closer to the hut, the ladder evaporates into nothing. He then notices a small sign on the way to the hut that says 'Success to go back'. He then gets to the hut, opens it, and instead of it being full with beautiful women wall-to-wall it instead has one really huge, overweight, greasy, boil and pimple covered skin of a man.

“I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes” replies Watson.

“And what do you deduce from that?”

Watson ponders for a minute.  “Well,

- Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three.

He was a pretty chill person, not too out of the ordinary.  In fact, we were pretty good friends.  That was before the incident though.

He went out to pick up groceries for us while I was at work, and he called me and said ""Hey AngerIssuez, do you want some ice cream?""  And me, being the lardass I was, responded with a ""Hell yeah I want ice cream!""  So he picked some up.

Then it started getting weird.

He started sending me pictures of the ice cream, and telling me how awesome it was.  Even though it was a bit weird, it got me a little excited, I'll admit.

So after about an hour after I get off work, Sean shows up with some grocery bags and asks ""Who's ready for some god-damn ice cream?!"" So I get up and walk over to him to finally dish myself a bowl of this ice cream that's I've been so ready for.

But it wasn't ice cream.  It was just fucking milk.","Sean Murray? You know, I think he was one of my college roommates!",0

anything! I want a pet that can do 
everything!""

The woman looks at the owner skeptically and says,""A millipede? 
can't imagine a millipede doing 
everything. But okay, I'll try a 
millipede."" 

When the woman gets the 
millipede home, she's eager to try 
him out, so she says to him,""Please 
clean the kitchen."" Thirty minutes 
later, she walks into the kitchen and 
it's spotless. All the dishes are cleaned 
and neatly put away. The cabinets are 
clean and the floor is waxed. She's 
absolutely amazed. 

Wanting to see what else he can 
do, the woman says to the millipede, 
""Please clean the living room."" 

Twenty-five minutes later, she walks 
into the living room, and again 
everything's perfect. The carpets have 
been vacuumed. The furniture was 
cleaned and dusted. The woman is 
once again impressed. 

The woman thinks to herself, 
""This is the most amazing thing I've 
ever seen. This pet really can do 
everything."" Wanting him to do more, 
she says to the millipede,""Run down 
to the corner store and get me a 
newspaper, please.""The millipede 
walks out of the living room. 

Ten minutes go by and no 
millipede. Twenty minutes go by and 
still no millipede. After thirty minutes 
the woman is starting to wonder 
what's going on. It should have taken 
the millipede only a couple 
minutes. But forty-five minutes later 
and still no millipede. 

Deciding to look for him, the 
woman goes to leave out the front 
door. She opens the door and the 
millipede is just sitting on the front 
steps. The woman becomes furious. 
She says,""Hey! Where have you been 
all this time? I asked you 45 minutes 
ago to go to the corner store and get 
me a newspaper. Then I come to find 
you and you're sitting down on the 
job. What's going on?""

Behind St. Peter was a gigantic wall of clocks. It went so high and so far off into the distance that the man couldn’t see where it ended.

The man, astonished by just about everything he was seeing because he had just transitioned from life on Earth, asked, “St. Peter, what are all those clocks behind you?”

St. Peter, looking up from his ledger and having found the man’s file, looked over his reading glasses and said matter-of-factly, “Those are ‘lie clocks.’”

The man looked puzzled and asked, “I’ve never heard of such a thing. What is a ‘lie clock’?”

St. Peter explained that in Heaven everyone alive on Earth has a ‘lie clock.’ He continued to explain that each and every time someone lies, the hands on his or her lie clock moves.

The man, a bit nervous because he knew he had lied a time or two during the course of his lifetime, pointed to a clock that seemed to be at midnight. “Whose clock is that?” he asked.

“That’s Mother Teresa’s clock,” St. Peter responded. “The hands on her clock have never moved; a testimony to her goodness and honesty.”

The man then pointed to a clock that signaled it had only moved two seconds. “Is that the clock of a child?” the man asked.

“No, that’s Abraham Lincoln’s clock,” St. Peter replied. “The hands on his clock have only moved twice telling us he lied only twice in his life. Remarkable for most.”

The man, having just dropped dead while screaming at a television set showing a Hillary Clinton campaign ad, asked, “Just out of curiosity, where is Hillary Clinton’s clock?”

St. Peter looked up from his ledger and, with a wry grin, said, “Oh, Hillary’s clock is in Jesus’s office. He uses it as a ceiling fan.”",Hillary's Lie Clock,0

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, “There's no charge.”

“No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,” she says.

“Honestly, ma’am it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.

Roosevelt was having issues with his health and they were discussing the prospect of Truman assuming the Office, should Roosevelt pass away.

Truman: ""Mr. President, any tips you can give me to succeed in office, the way you have for so long?""

""Well"" said the President, ""The most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""

Truman frowned and then asked, ""But how do I know the people around me are intelligent?""

The President: ""Easy, you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle.""

The President pushed a button on his intercom. ""Chief of Staff, would you come in here, please?""

Chief of Staff walked into the room and said, ""Yes, sir?""

The President smiled and said, ""Answer me this please. Your mother and father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

Without pausing for a moment, Chief of Staff answered, ""That would be me, sir.""

""Very good! Thank you!"" said the President.

Then he turned to Truman with a smile and said ""See?""


Now it's Truman's turn to apply the same logic...
Truman went back to his office and asked his assistant: ""Answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

""I'm not sure."" said the assistant. ""Let me get back to you on that one...""

The assistant went to the staff and asked every one, but no one could give him an answer. Finally, he ran into Albert Einstein, who was visiting the White House.

The assistant was aware of Einstein's reputation as a man of great intelligence, and asked: ""Hey, Mr. Einstein, can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Einstein answered, ""That's easy, it's me!""

Assistant said, ""Thanks!""

Then he went back to Truman: ""I did some thinking and I have the answer to that riddle. That child's name? Albert Einstein""
