John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula, when he realized he's forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is -π times the radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong, so he starts over, coming back to the same equation.

When promises to call, won't wait weeks.
I pray that he be gainfully employed,
And when I spend his cash, won't be annoyed.
Pulls out my chair and opens my door,
Massages my back and begs to do more.
Oh! send me a man who will make love to my mind,
Knows just what to say when I ask, ""how big's my behind?""
One who'll make love till my body's a twitching,
In the hall, the loo, the garden and kitchen!

The wife says 'I'm fed up with you going out and getting drunk every night, if you don't get clean I'll divorce you'
So naturally the man says 'of course okay I'll stop drinking'
Later that night - he's drinking again, in fact he was so drunk he threw up all over himself, the man doesn't know what to do he says 'oh shit my wife is gonna divorce me I promised her I wouldn't get drunk again!' 
And another man sitting on a barstool replied, 'don't worry mate, just take a tenner, put it in your pocket and say someone else threw up on you and the money is for the dry cleaning'
'Oh shit thanks that's a good idea' the man replies, and proceeds to walk home to see his wife.
The wife opens the door and sees her husband in his state and immediately says 'alright that's it I'm divorcing you!' To which the man says
'Wait I can explain! A man threw up on me I wasn't drinking myself see look he gave me a tenner for the dry cleaning!' T

With the many compasses, ropes, sails, and oars, one exhibit stood out from the others; a seemingly makeshift Indian submarine. It was covered in rust, and it was not uncommon for people to tape pages of derogatory phrases and jokes onto the ship with the gift shop's calligraphy set. 

On a particularly busy day, a man saw a flyer on the vessel, and upon the stationary was the most intricate joke he had ever seen. The sudden and relatable punchline made him collapse into knee-slapping hysteria, which attracted many people to the flyer. 

As the contagion of laughter grew, the museum's curator became more and more annoyed. ""Why, they don't even care about MY Museum anymore. They just care about some joke a child wrote."" He thought to himself. He didn't want his museum to be tarnished by whatever joke was written, so he decided to put a stop to it.

He marched to the submarine's exhibit, where he pushed through a crowd of laughing lunatics, and tore the page from the ship. 

It took a few seconds, but there was a sudden outcry of protest. 

""Why, man? Can't we have some fun for once?"" A loud man's voice echoed over the protest.
""This joke is highly not safe for work! I cannot have my venue tarnished by such foul words!"" The old curator spat.

An older gentleman walked out of the now quieting crowd. ""There is a simple solution"" his gentle voice spoke.
""And what would that be?"" The curator said, in a mocking tone.
""Repost the joke to this sub; you may have some good karma in it for you."" The man said, chuckling to himself. 

But the crowd did not buy it.
""The greedy creep is just going to take credit for this genius's work!"" A man yelled, reigniting the flame of protest. 
""No! I'll credit the original writer!""
But the curator's words were lost in the chaos of this sub.

The day was really quite beautiful, and the drink facilitated some deep thinking. My wife walked by and asked me what I was doing, and I said, ""Nothing.""  The reason I said ""nothing"" instead of saying ""just thinking"" is because she then would have asked, ""About what?"" At that point I would have had to explain that men are deep thinkers about various topics, which would lead to other questions. 

Finally I pondered an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?  Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?  Well, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion.  A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""  On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

Dear John, this is Alan next door. I am sorry buddy, but I have a confession to make to you. I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling you in text as I can’t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing. The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you.

I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. I promise that it won't happen again. Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.

Regards, Alan.

The Response



John, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, stomped next door and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home, poured himself a stiff drink and went out into the garden for some fresh air. He took out his phone where he saw he had a subsequent message from his neighbor.


The Second Text Message

Hi John,

This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the slight typo on my last text. I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you noticed that my smart phone’s Autocorrect feature changed “Wi-Fi” to ˜Wife”. Technology hey?? Hope you saw the funny side of that.

You think to yourself ""Hey, I bet one of those bricks will fall today"", and you go up to it, and begin grilling down on it, trying to guess exactly which brick will fall.

And then you hear it, the sound of 2 unstable bricks scratching each other, and you have a long discussion to yourself which will fall first. Like, you see that one brick tilting more downwards than the other, but then again the other is shaking slightly. Finally, you make a decision, and try to force that brick to fall with your mind, or you just blow on it, hoping you will win. ""C'mon son, I know you can do it, just fall and beat your rival, Adam!""

And when Adam falls down, you switch sides automatically. Bashing down on your son, ""You are a disappointment to me Ryan, why couldn't you just fall down and beat Adam. Look at him, he's a natural at this. I have disowned you, and you mean nothing to me"". Then you hear a slight whistle above you, and look up to see whats going on. 

Oh look, a brick in the air, just sitting there. Wait a minute, why is it growing? ""Adam, are you coming to embrace your parent? You are the best brick I have ever seen, Adam, give me a hug."" And then you come back to your senses and wonder why exactly that brick is growing by the second? Could it be that Adam is really coming to embrace you, or does he just need to stop eating mortar? You think over it for a few seconds, trying to find a logical solution to this magic. And then it hits you.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

He goes deeply and you shiver, your body tenses, but he's gentle like he promised he would be. He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him. He's done this many times before. His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room, for easy entrance. 

You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause as little pain as possible.

 As he presses closer going deeper, you feel the tissue give way. Pain surges through your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. 

He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are filled with tears, but you shake your head and nod to go on. He begins going in and out with skill, but you are now too numb to feel him within you.

 After a few moments you feel something bursting within you as he pulls it out. You lay panting, glad to have it all over with. He looks at you and smiles warmly and tells you with a chuckle, that you have been his most stubborn, yet rewarding experience.

 You smile and thank your dentist.

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""
""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me Id like you to pass a little test. Its called the Triple Filter Test.""
""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.
""Thats right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes lets take a moment to filter what youre going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""
""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""
""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you dont really know if its true or not. Now lets try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""
""No, on the contrary...""
""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though youre not certain its true?""
The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""
""No, not really.""
""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

This made her feel much better and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and she started to follow it.

After quite some time had passed she was somewhat surprised when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to her car and signaled for her to roll down her window. The snow plow driver wanted to know if she was all right as she had been following him for a long time. She said that she was fine and told him of her dad's advice to follow a snow plow when caught in a blizzard. 

The driver replied that it was okay with him and she could continue following if she wanted but he was done with the Walmart parking lot and was going over to the K-mart  next. ",A blonde got caught in a blizzard…,137

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""


""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,


""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""


Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.


""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.


At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""


Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.


""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.


""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.


Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.


Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""


His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

We advise outdoorsmen to wear noisy little bells on their clothing so that the bears are not startled unexpectedly by a human's presence. We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.

It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of bear activity. Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear poop and grizzly bear poop.

post,6nrcnz,2qh72,jokes,false,1500272522,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6nrcnz/high_noon/,self.jokes,,"An old west dime novel writer is out looking for a good story when he wanders into a saloon. He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""",High Noon!,97

""Excuse me, sir, is there anything I can help you find?"" said one of the store clerks from behind him. 

""Oh, uh, yeah,"" the customer said, startled. He looked around him quickly and picked up one of the  newer-looking tricks. ""What does this do?"" he asked. 

The store clerk replied, ""Oh, that?"" She picked it up and spun it around her finger - or attempted to. ""It's a Fidget Spinner Joke. You can try as hard as you want, but it will never spin.""

He laughed. ""That sounds hilarious! What does this one do?"" 

""That's our Padlock Joke - it will never open with any key ever, even the one that's provided with it.""

""Cool! Can you tell me about these?"" And so it went on and on as he asked the poor shopkeeper about what seemed like every new item in the store, until he came back to the wall of sweets. 

""What about these Chirp Chocolates?"" he asks. 

""Well,"" says the worker, somehow still keeping her energy up, ""If you eat one, it'll make you chirp like a bird for a whole minute.""

""That's hilarious!"" laughs the boy. ""Do these Hoot Gummies make you hoot like an owl?"" She nodded. ""And these Squeaking Marshmallows? And- hey, what's this?"" He reached into the large container of wrapped mints and pulled out a brightly-colored fishing reel that had a very tiny handle.

The bartender asks, ""Are you a talking duck, too?"" 

""Yessir,"" says the duck. 

""Well, what's your name?"" he asks. 

""Douie,"" says the duck. 

""Well, how was your day?"" asks the bartender. 

""Great. I've been in and out of puddles at the pond, blew bubbles for a bit, and now I can have myself a Bloody Mary as well,"" Douie says. 

The bartender says, ""Oh, that's fine!""

Out jumps a third duck. 

The bartender says, ""Well, I suppose you talk, too."" 

""Yes, I do,"" replies the third duck. 

""Let me guess, you are Louie and want a Bloody Mary?"" asks the bartender. 

""No,"" says the duck, ""my name is Puddles. And don't ask how my day is going, just get me a shot and get one for my buddy in the hat, Bubbles.""","A guy walks into a bar, takes off his hat, and places it onto the counter. A duck jumps out.",17
