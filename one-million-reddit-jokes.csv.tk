""This is your last chance, get in!"" yelled the boatman. 


""No, Jesus will save me!"" came the reply. 


The boat went off and a couple of seconds later, the man drowned. Arriving in Heaven, he was greeted by Jesus.

Hare used to make fun of the tortoise about his speed. After getting fed up of all the remarks of hare, tortoise proposed a bet to race to finally conclude who is faster. Hare being confident in himself agreed to the bet. They both started the race from the agreed point. Hare ran as fast as he could to reach the end point soon but tortoise being as what God made him dragged with his speed. Hare after reaching the mid point of the race track stopped and decided to take rest because of his confidence of winning the race. Being tired of the running he soon fell asleep under a tree. Meanwhile, tortoise maintained his speed and kept on dragging himself to the end point. Soon enough, tortoise reached the end point but the hare kept sleeping. When he woke he mistakenly realised he was still winning the race and tortoise was way back. But when he reached the end point he knew he had lost the race because of his over confidence.

Hare was not satisfied with the result so he proposed the bet again for next day to which tortoise agreed. When the race started hare ran as faster as he could, and this time he didn't take rest and reached the end point. He won and gained his over confidence back. When tortoise reached the end point after few hours he saw that hare has already won.

This time tortoise was not satisfied with the result and proposed to race again next day but this time he added that the track would be chosen by him. Hare being over confident agreed to the new term and reached the next at the chosen track. But the tortoise proved to be clever because the race track he chose was to cross the river to opposite bank. Hare knew he couldn't swim so he stayed there and tortoise jumped into the river to reach the end point, but he drowned because tortoise can't fucking swim.",The Tale Of Hare &amp; Tortoise,9

""how do you boil eggs without cracking them?""

I got the following response comment with 0 answers:

&gt; Mod here. This is a cooking website and eggs cracking is not related to cooking. However, as an exception I will allow this question for you and lets see what responses we get. A little more details would be appreciated

So I modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops."".

&gt; mod here. Please describe which species, texture and color.

So I did some research and modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken"".

&gt; Please mention how you're boiling it, which vessel, for how long, how much water.

I now modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken. I'm boiling them in a kettle, with enough water to submerge the eggs. Have boiled them for around 8-10 minutes"".

&gt; Mod here. It would be great if you could provide a link to the bird species and upload a screenshot for your kettle. Please ignore this if you don't think that this is necessary.

I replied that I didn't think it was necessary.

&gt; Mod here. I have edited your question anyhow and provided a link for the hen's species. I have also added a generic image showing a kettle and the boiling egg and deleted all previous conversations.

I replied ""okay cool. It looks good so far. I hope someone replies to it"".

&gt; Mod here.  This question has received 1 vote for closing as ""too subjective"". This question is too vast and cannot possibly be answered by anyone.

Meanwhile my question already had a couple of upvotes and I received the following answer -  ""Are you sure you didn't shake the egg before boiling it? Maybe you were trying to spin them to check whether they were boiled but in the process upset the albumen structure.""

That's it! I chose the answer as the right answer and marked my question as answered.

&gt; Mod here. This question has been closed as ""too subjective"" based on 5 votes. There is no way of answering this question. Please modify your question so that it's less subjective and it relates to the community.

*I made up this joke on the stackexchange websites based on how strict their community is. When you try to ask a simple question then the mods keep trying to edit your question until it ends up closed for some reason or the other.*",Joke on the stackexchange website (You'll only understand it if you have asked queries on the stackexchange sites),17

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that. It is Modi in India and not Manmohan.

Trump: So what?

CIA: Modi will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our stealth drone back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite gov't of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1Bs.
USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of staff: If you do so we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump: What  the hell should I do???

In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. 

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. 

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. 

The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.",Happy May,315

The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then found it kind of amusing.

When her 2 teenage daughters returned from school, the bird saw them enter and said, ""New house, new madam, new girls.""

The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation considering how and where the parrot had been raised.

She informs them that they will not only be free to go after the ensuing ritual of tribute, but they will also take the three of them back to civilisation on the tribes own canoe.

Four amazons hold down friend number one, and check his canvas bag for the offering... 
He's brought a bunch of grapes.

I really didn't want to take this thing home so i obliged. 
Knocked on the first door and the guy told me it was the old lady on the corners cat.

With a heavy heart i knock on her door, she answers and says: oh yeah thats my mittens, i knew it was bound to happen.

'God Almighty!' shouted Mary and the teacher said, 'Very good,' and Mary slowly fell back asleep.

A while later the teacher asked Mary, 'Who is our Lord and Saviour?' But Mary didn't even stir from her slumber.

Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.

'Jesus Christ!' yelled Mary and the teacher said, 'Very good,' and Mary slowly fell back asleep.

When the teacher asked for volunteers to tell their story, a number of children raised their hands, including Little Johnny, but the teacher knew better than to call on him. She called on Susie instead.

""My daddy is a farmer,"" said Susie. ""When we took our eggs to the market this Saturday, we hit a bump and the basket bounced. All our eggs broke.""

""That's a good story Susie, what's the moral?"" Asked the teacher.

""Don't put all your eggs in one basket,"" Susie replied.

Happy with that example, the teacher asked for another story, and again ignored Little Johnyy's flailing, this time calling on Tommy.

""My daddy is also a farmer,"" said Tommy. ""Last spring we put 200 eggs in incubators, but only 170 hatched. The moral is 'don't count your chickens before they're hatched.'""

Very satisfied now the teacher asked for a final volunteer. At this point Little Johnny looked like he was about to have a seizure, so she took pity on him and asked for his story.

""OK,"" said Little Johnny. ""This story is about my Uncle Ted. Uncle Ted was in Afghanistan. One time Uncle Ted was flying a recon mission when his engines failed. Uncle Ted checked, and in the plane he had one pistol, with 9 rounds, a machete, and a bottle of scotch.""

""As Uncle Ted was floating to the ground after bailing out, he drank the entire bottle of scotch. To his shock, he landed right in an Al Qaeda training camp. Well, Uncle Ted didn't hesitate, he pulled out his pistol, and with 9 rounds killed 9 terrorists.""

""Then Uncle Ted pulled out the machete. He killed five guys before the blade broke. There were only two guys left at that point, and My Uncle Ted strangled the life out of them with his bare fucking hands.""

At this point, Little Johnny has concluded his story to stunned silence. 

""What moral could that story possibly have?!"" Demanded Little Johnny's teacher.

""Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""

""I have an older friend, much like you, who is an avid hunter and never misses a season. One day he was setting off to go hunting. In a bit of a hurry, he accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his gun.""

""As he neared a lake, he came across a very large male beaver sitting at the water's edge. He realized he left his gun at home, and so, he couldn't shoot the magnificent creature.

While he was lying there, a cow came by and took a dump on him. As the frozen blue bird lay there in the heap of steaming pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was.

The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

Morals of the story:

(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.

(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.

(3) And when you are in deep shit, it is best to keep your mouth shut!

post,4h3zsj,2qh72,jokes,false,1462012336,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4h3zsj/there_was_once_a_priest_who_went_to_see_the_world/,self.jokes,," After many years of
wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in
the middle of nowhere. The people there
believed in the same religion as he did, but they
had no church; they had to go to the nearest one
which was in a small town 25 km's from there.
The priest took the initiative, asked the Church
for support, and with the help of the local men
they built their own temple. From there on, he
was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining
together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and
saying prayers at the funerals.
Many years passed by like that.
At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring,
on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding
the people out of the church, was about to close
the gates when an unknown man stepped into
the churchyard.
With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before
the priest and said:
Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!
- the priest was a good man, and even though he
thought the request was a bit strange, he went
back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in
half, took it back to the man and gave it to him,
who looked back to the priest with gratitude.
However, the priest was curious. He asked:
Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with
a fright on his face, and before the priest could
have said a thing, he rushed out of the
churchyard gate and took off.
A week later, around the same time, when the
priest was leaving the church, he found himself
in front of the same man in the churchyard. The
man said:
Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!
- the priest was surprised by the appearance of
the man and his strange request. Of course he
was good, went back to the rectory, and brought
the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand
and immediately he asked:
Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why
do you need this half a lemon? - the man was
obviously frightened and immediately ran away
but the priest was not sluggish either and ran
after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he
has never run so much and so fast before so he
was out of breath by the end of the village,
almost fainted. He thought the strange man
might appear again next week, and it would be
nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent
his week working on his cardio. It turned out to
be a good idea, because as he thought, the
stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The
priest didn't even wait for the request, he was
good, and brought the half lemon. He received
these words from the man:
Thank you priest for being so good and giving me
half a lemon.
Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please
tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time
he finished his sentence the man was already
running, but the priest was close behind. They
were running for a while and the priest was
starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a
wide and swift river. The stranger without
thinking threw himself into the river and swam
across the river and disappeared on the other
side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't
swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He
spent the next week learning to swim at the
swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away.
He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday;
now he was sure that the weird fellow would
visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the
church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:
Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!
- the priest was good, went back, put on his
swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half
of the lemon and took it to the stranger:
Here it is, my son, but please tell me already,
why do you need it? - the guy was terrified,
rushed out the gate with the priest following.
Reached the river, swam across, the priest right
behind him. He kept running on the other side of
the river and the priest was still on his tail. They
kept running until they got to a tall tree on the
verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the
tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not
knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the
ground. He was cursing everything as he walked
back home. The following week the villagers
watched as the priest in the garden of the
church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and
generally behaving very strangely. The priest
didn't care, he was exercising obsessively,
preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday
before the mass, he put on his trunks and
running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was
good and put half a lemon in his pocket in
advance. The mass finished much earlier than
usually, and he emptied the church as soon as
possible so he could warm up. In the same exact
time the mass should have ended, the strange
man entered the churchyard.
Priest, please be good... - the priest was already
handing him half of a lemon, and asked:
Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the
man ran away terrified, the priest followed him.
They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the
tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the
stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to
the other side of the ravine. The priest was
about to have a stroke, but then he saw another
vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across.
There, however, he encountered an unexpected
obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man
closed himself in one of the wreckages. The
priest was raging as he walked around the
wreckage several times, but he found no
entrance except for the sealed door on the side
of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He
was furious but he went home. He spent every
day at the village's locksmith and learned every
possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he
held the mass in his swimming trunks, running
shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was
a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill,
then he stood in front of the church and waited
for the man. He was there on time.
Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!
There you go, son - handing him the lemon,
because he was good, but in the same time he
grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and
with obsession in his eyes, asked:
But what do you need it for?! - panic came over
the man as he made his escape from the
priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was
very close behind. Racing to the river they
quickly got across, running up the tree almost
breaking their necks, one after the other swung
across the ravine, the man barely managed to
close the door of the wreckege in the priest's
face. Little did he know that the priest would not
stop there, because he grabbed his backpack
and started working on the lock with his tools. In
less than an hour the heavy door creaked open.
Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he
was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant
look. The priest slowly strode up to the man,
crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly
smile on his face, gently asked:
Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for
the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to
you, even in the future, I am only asking in return
that you tell me: why do you need it?
All right, priest ... - came the answer in a
trembling tone - I will answer your question, but
please, be good, and do not tell anyone.
The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.,93

After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, 'Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we were destined to meet and be friends for the rest of our days.'

The man replies, 'I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God!'

The woman continues, 'And look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.'

Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle before handing it back to the woman.

The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it to the man.

The man asks, 'Aren't you having any?'

The woman replies, 'No, I think I'll just wait for the police...'

Here's the evidence: Do you really believe that the Rams and Eagles would give up that much for unknown quarterbacks if the draft was real? I sure don't. They did it because the NFL promised them victories and records if they made this draft drama happen. They did it because the NFL will make sure these two young men are successes, unless they want them to be busts. If they want that, they'll set the poor guys up like they did with Johnny Football, RG3 (though this one had way more drama!!!!), David Carr, Ryan Leaf, Jamarcus Russell, and so many more! The only one who tried to go off script was Tim Tebow, and he got blacklisted for it!!! There is also no way that Laremy Tunsil would post a video of himself smoking pot... unless the NFL told him to for more ratings on draft day. He seems like a smart young guy, he wouldn't do it if the league was real. Too bad, the NFL will probably have him arrested for ""drug possession"" in a year or two. And now the best evidence, I will predict some more drama today (though if the NFL sees this, they'll change the script to make me seem like the crazy one, LOL). Maybe Myles Jack will have some troubles aside from his injuries? Or something like that. So anyways, the only real winner yesterday was the only real team left, the New England Patriots. The NFL and Goodell are trying to stomp out any REAL integrity by bringing them down with (fake) penalties. But it's okay, because the great New England Patriots can see through the haze to win the Superbowl. Goodell wants to take the best QB ever away? Fine, we have a future Hall of Fame QB waiting to take over. You want to give the (cheater) Broncos the Super Bowl for Payton 'HGH' Manning's birthday? Fine, at least we won where it counts. And you can bet your a** that there will be HUNDREDS of ""questionable"" calls against the great New England Patriots this year, but we'll overcome and win the entire thing again!",The real joke is the NFL,0

""That's amazing,"" his Dad says. ""How do I get Ole' Blue in that program?""
""Just send him over here with $1,000,"" the young man says, ""and I'll get him in the course.""
So, his Father sends the dog and $1,000.
About two-thirds of the way through the semester, the money again runs out.  The boy calls home.
""So how's Ole' Blue doing son?"" his Father asks.
""Awesome, Dad, he's talking up a storm,"" he says, ""but you just won't believe this. They've had such good results they have started to teach the animals how to read!""
""Read!?"" says his Father, ""No kidding! How do we get Blue in that program?""
""Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class.""
The money promptly arrives. At the end of the year, his Father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. Even though he was always pretty much able to lie his way out of trouble, the fellow asked his girlfriend to help him think of a really good lie to tell his Dad.
She very quickly came up with a plan for him.  She has him shoot the dog.

So the fox has just come back from a weekend break in Amsterdam, and managed to sneak some high-grade weed back with her. It's a beautiful sunny day, so she decides to relax at a nearby lake and smoke a joint.

She's just sparked up when a frog pops his head up out of the water and is like:

""Brah that shit smells next level, wanna gimme a hit?""

Being a bit of a trickster, and also a little bummed that her sweet 'Dam weed is already being blagged, the fox decides to fuck with the frog a little.

""This weed is so good, that you need to get as high as possible from it, and not waste it.

So my little green friend, I'll make you a deal. If you can take a hit, hold it in, and swim underwater all the way around that island out there and back without coming up for air, I'll let you have another hit!""

Even though this seems like an impossible task (the island is at least a 1/4 mile from the shore), the frog agrees - after all he'll get at least one free toke. So he takes an almighty hit from the joint, and starts swimming. The Sativa power of this weed must have given him Shiva's super strength or some such shit, because he makes it all the way around the island and back, before popping his head out in front of the fox and breathing a cloud of smoke out of his red-eyed little face.

The fox, now pretty stoned, bursts out in laughter at this. 

""Oh my god man, I can't believe you actually made it! I'm so impressed, that I'll do you the same deal again. You make it, you get a third free hit!""

The frog shrugs, takes a moment to get his breath back, then hits the joint like a hero and dives in. But this time, he gets halfway round the island and realizes there's no way in Hell he's going to make it. He surfaces, breathes out, and through the dissipating smoke he sees the silhouette of a hippopotamus. 

""Hey there little guy!"" says the hippo, ""that smoke smells dank as your mamma's sweet ass, you got any spare nugs fam?""

Coughing and spluttering, the frog says ""No, but, uuuuuh there's this cool fox over on the shore that can sort you out!""

""Nice one bruv!"" says the hippo, dives down, and swims towards the shore to find the fox.

He surfaces right in front of the fox, and before he can get a word in, the fox screams:

""Oh my dear god, exhale the smoke, EXHALE THE SMOKE GODDAMMIT!!!!""",Fox goes to Amsterdam,3

Upon further investigation, and only 1 attempt to eat it, they release the genie inside who graciously grants them each 3 wishes.

Bear, who lives in the moment quickly says:

""I wish that every other bear in the forest was a hot lady bear who wanted my sweaty bear balls!""

Rabbit and the Genie are clearly disgusted, but Genie being a slave, begrudgingly grants the wish.  While this was happening Rabbit was considering his options, and when it was his turn to make a wish, he didn't wait either.

""I wish for a Harley Davidson, that I could ride, you know, one made for Rabbits!""

Genie smiles, and grants his wish.  (Genies don't like you to ask for something easy, or gross, challenge them you know?)

Bear all this time, what little their was, is thinking about all that sweet bear action he is going to get, and he gets hornier and hornier, finally blurting out,

""I wish every other bear in the country, was a hot lady bear who wanted my sweaty bear balls.""

Genie is even more disgusted, this time with himself, knowing in a single generation or two, bears will be nearly gone from this country, but being a servant he grants the wish, and bear sees a lady bear coming into the clearing and goes to her, and starts doing what comes naturally to a horny bear.

Rabbit, opposed to watching this, is checking out his sweet new ride, and notices he is missing something.  He turns to the genie and says

""I wish for all the accessories, and leather vests, and helmets, and saddle bags.  I need all of them to be rabbit sized, and I need holes in the helmet for my ears, and a sidecar, so I can take my friends on rides too.""

Genie smiles and in a cloud of smoke rabbit and his Harley disappear in a flash, and a cloud of smoke.  When they reappear Rabbit is decked out, and his bike has enough chrome to make SAMCRO jealous.  Rabbit starts up the bike, and starts riding circles around the clearing.   

Bear, who is on his ""Lady Friend"" nearing completion, screams out over the noise of the Harley and smoke

""I wish every other bear in the world was a hot lady bear, who wanted my sweaty bear balls.""

Genie and Rabbit stare at each other, wondering who will speak first after standing witness to the destruction of a species.  All bears in the world are essentially dead, and only they know it.  

Rabbit laughs, and rides across the clearing, screaming as he goes...

post,4h0rt8,2qh72,jokes,false,1461954280,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4h0rt8/the_ancient_secret_of_the_monk/,self.jokes,,"About 35 years ago there was a single man taking a drive down a seeming empty country side. His car began to stall a bit as he turned down the green, mountainous land. When it finally died it just so happened to roll in front of a little monastery.

A monk came out and asked if he needed help. There was no reception anywhere and the nearest station was at least 75 miles so he obliged. The monks took him on and said they could fix his car at no charge but it would take the night. The man was having a midlife crisis so he did not even have a plan for where he was heading. He had quit his job and was just traveling anywhere.

After he barely dozed off to thoughts about what was next in life for him he heard this strange, mesmerizing sound. It started light, but grew to a louder hum that seemed to penetrate his soul. He could feel power coming from the sound and pure beauty. It kept him up all night. The next morning the monks told him his car was fixed and asked if he needed anything else.

""I would like to know what was that sound?"" The man asked.

""Sorry I can't tell you because you're not a monk."" The head monk replied.

The man shrugged it on and moved on with his life. He ended up getting a small apartment and a boring office job. He never forgot the sound but it gradually became a very faded memory until one fateful day.

The man got a job offer at a bigger firm back across the country and he packed up his car to head back. He was going to be making almost triple what he was and have more perks. he decided to drive the same scenic route from 5 years ago and revisit the colorful countryside.

As his car moved him down the pavement he suddenly heard a familiar sound. The engine echoed a call familiar to five years ago and began to stutter. Fate must have returned him because it broke down in front of the same monastery.

As he lay awake at night, this time not sleeping at all, he let the same strange sound soak into his being. It consumed him, he could not escape it and he knew it brought him back.

The next morning he begged to be told or shown the source of the sound, but was met with the same friction.

""I can't tell you because you are not a monk.""

He pleaded, ""obviously you weren't always monks if some of you can fix cars like this foreign one. Please tell me how can I become a monk.""

The monk could feel the triangular connection between this man, the universe and himself. He decided he was worthy and told him to become one with nature. 

The monk gave him to simple tasks for anyone destined to be a one of them, ""Travel all the world and become one with yourself and the earth. When you have traveled the world and can tell me the exact number of grains of sand and blades of grass you will be a monk.""

The man set out on his journey, forgoing the new job. It took him 30 years but he traveled all of the world and finally understood the answers. He was able to see the numbers because he became on with the world itself. To him it was now like counting fingers. It was simple.

He returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for.. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monk congratulates him and says, ""You are now one of us. You are ready for the secret to the sound, the secret of the monk, the secret of the universe.""

That night they headed down to a basement where the sound was getting louder and louder with each step. The power was radiating through the man and around him already as he stepped to the wooden door.

""What you seek is behind the door."" The monk stated.

The man pulled at the wooden door but it was locked so he asked the monk for a key. The monk already had it in his hand and gave it to him. Behind that door is a door made of stone. The man asked for the key to this one as it was locked as well.

""use your palm, you already know the technique."" The man was hesitant but as he had become one with the world he believed and places his palm on the door. The rich sound was vibrating the door to his touch and opened for him. 

This continues on through a ruby door, a sapphire door and even more...emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst. 

Until finally they reach a door made of diamond. It is suddenly quiet as they stand before the door. The man places his palm on it and nothing happens. The monk tells him to believe and it will open.

As the man closes his eyes and breath deep, remembering the past 30 years something begins to happen. The sound returns, humming low at first. It is as if the sound is intertwined into the gleaming beams of light reflecting off the diamond door.

The sound now surround him, it floods out as the doors burst open. He open his eyes and is astonished. Here is the most astonishing, beautiful thing in all of the universe. Tears form in his eyes but are swept away in the radiance of the light and sound. He can't believe what he just saw.

 I just can't tell you what it was because you're not a monk.

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that. It is Modi in India and not Manmohan.

Trump: So what?

CIA: Modi will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our stealth drone back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite gov't of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1Bs.
USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of staff: If you do so we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump: What  the hell should I do???

A biologist, a physicist, a mathematician, and an engineer can't take it anymore and decide to commit suicide. 

The biologist reviews some data and determines the impact velocity required to kill a human. He then  calculates the appropriate drop height using basic conservation of energy, and finds a suitable building.  The biologist jumps off, but the wind resistance slows him down just enough that he survives with major crippling injuries. 

The physicist, hearing of this, develops a more complex model. He models himself as a uniform cone and uses a second order drag model to account for wind resistance. He obtains a numerical solution for the appropriate drop height, which is a little bit higher than what the biologist had anticipated. He finds a suitable building, and jumps off. On the way down, a strong gust blows him into a tree, and then he bounces to the ground. He survives with major crippling injuries. 

The mathematician hears of this and is determined to do it right. He models himself as a non-uniform complex 3D body, and sets up a full-on coupled analysis using the Navier-Stokes equations. To determine the required impact velocity, he uses nonlinear FEA software to model skeletal impact. He then reviews 50 years of local wind statistics and surveys the surrounding area to determine any possible gusts and their respective  probabilities. He analyzes an array of scenarios using a supercomputer running the best CFD software, and determines a 99% confidence interval for the required drop height. He picks the highest number and applies an additional 10% margin of safety. Finally, the mathematician finds a suitable building and jumps off. Higher than average ambient temperatures cause a nearby snow pile to collapse and slide right into the impact zone. The snow cushions his fall just enough that he survives with major crippling injuries. 

The engineer shot himself in the face.","A biologist, a physicist, a mathematician, and an engineer...",133
