- You musta jack-off, now!

- You musta take your dick out and masturbate, right now or I'll shoot you!  
So the guy has no choice, and does what the paesano asks. After 5 minutes, he's done, and the paesano shouts ""Again, now! Or I shoot!"".  
The guy doesn't understand what's going on, but no choice, he tries to focus as much as he can, he close his eyes and thinks of beautiful girls, and after 10 minutes of effort, he manages to cum.  
""Again, or I'll shoot! I'll splash your brains on the road!"" yells the paesano  
This is really getting too much, but what choice does he have? The poor guy thinks of all his fantasies, even the darkest, and after twenty minutes of painstaking jacking off, his dick raw and sore, he manages to spout a little drop of cum.  
He's exhausted, and begs ""No more please, I really can't do it anymore""  
So the paesano goes behind a bush and brings back a pretty young girl, and gently asks the guy:  
""In that case, mister, could you kindly drive my sister to the  city?""

He kidnapped the first three people he could find - a physics professor, a chemistry professor, and a math professor. The janitor was able to drag them all into separate pantries in the cafeteria, and once he was satisfied that the doors were sufficiently locked, left the school as well.

When the school reopened, the staff were shocked when they entered the cafeteria and found a pantry door broken open. Inside, they found chalk writings on the walls and floor, containing formulas and equations for force, structural integrity of the lock, and angle of strike. They reasoned that a physics professor was trapped inside, and managed to break the lock with the cans and escape.

The next pantry door was also opened, and the interior likewise had chalk writing on every surface - this time, chemical formulas and equations for the chemical composition of the lock, the cans, and the canned contents. A few opened cans and metal shavings were on the floor, and a large black mark on the door. The staff reasoned that a chemistry professor had also been trapped, but had blown the door open and escaped.

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control tractors and even tractor board games. All he ever wanted to do was one day own his own tractor. When Jimmy was 15 he even managed to find himself some tractor porn, which was not easy to come by. One day whilst Jimmy was reading about tractors he gets a call from the hospital, his father had been in an accident and he needed to get there right away. Jimmy immediately put down his book and ran to the hospital to see his father. Once he arrived he was greeted by a nurse and taken to see his father, it was bad, his father was crossing a road when a car came hurling down the street and hit him. The nurse told him that he may not have long left and left the room, his father, very weakly said, ""Jimmy, all your life all you have ever wanted was a tractor, if I don't make it through this I will leave you my estate and you can buy your very own tractor."" After more heartfelt conversation between the two, his father sadly passed away. A few weeks later Jimmy received his father's wealth and set off to a farming auction to buy himself a tractor. The first tractor for sell was a dark green onre, it was just within his budget and he really took a shine to it, so he bid and bid until he reached his limit and then said to himself, ""no more, I will wait for the next one"". The next tractor up was a modern blue tractor, Jimmy like this one even more than the first one so as before he bid and bid until he reached his limit, but this was a great tractor so he carried on bidding a little bit more but alas he kept getting outbid. So he stopped and waited for the third tractor. This tractor was the cutting edge red tractor, Jimmy immediately fell in love as it was on the cover of his porno magazine, he was now determined to get this tractor. So he bid and bid and bid but just kept getting outbid, he then passed double what he was willing to spend because he loved this tractor so much, so he kept bidding but to no avail, he simply just getting outbid, with tears in his eyes Jimmy let it go and left the auction. He walked home absolutely devastated that he couldn't get the tractor he wanted, this eventually became rage and he ripped off his tractor wallpaper, through out his remote control tractors, the out his tractor board games and he even burnt his tractor porn. After this rage he decided to go to a bar to make him feel better. The bar he choose to drown his sorrows ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that he was having some trouble breathing. After many minutes of displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the bar, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he went back over to the bar, the barman asked ""how on earth did you do that?"" to which he replied, ""I'm an extractor fan.""",Jimmy was always a big fan of tractors,9

""Do not enter"" reads a yellow sign right before the fenced in entrance. Defiantly so, the Asian man persists they walk through.

Shortly upon entering they hear, ""Don't move or I'll shoot."" Shocked, they all put their hands up and turn around to an elderly man hoisting a gun. ""What are you all doing trespassing, didn't you read the sign?"" Says the man. Just as the Caucasian prepares to answer, he is interrupted by the elderly man saying, ""Gather me 10 of your favorite fruits and meet me back here, and don't think about leaving or I'll shoot."" 

The Asian is the first back, and he had gathered 10 grapes. ""Now, I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen. I'm gonna shove these up your ass, and if you make it to 10, I'll let you go. If you make any noises before 10, I'm shooting ya."" Well, one by one the farmer shoves them up his bum. Around 6 the Asian winces in pain and is shot.

So next is the Caucasian man. He had gathered Apples, so the farmer explained to him the rules. Well he started the routine and the American gets to 9 and starts busting out laughing. Without hesitation the farmer shoots him.

Rejoined in heaven is Asian and white man. The Asian asks, ""Bill! You were so close, one more and you could've been free, what happened?"" Bill smiles and says, ""I saw Dax over there in the watermelon patch and couldn't contain myself.""",The Fruit Farmer,3

Not just any bar though, this bar is located on the 112th floor of a skyscraper. The depressed man, dragging his head, sits down and with a slight sob in his voice asks the bar tender for his cheapest whiskey.
A tall, somewhat nerdy looking gentleman sitting nearby notices the depressed man, ""Hey buddy, what's bothering you?"". 
The depressed man looks deep into his glass shaking slightly, ""My wife left me for my best friend... she took everything, the house, my kids, my money, even my dog. I have nothing left"". 
The gentleman smirks, ""Well hey, it's never too late to turn things around"". 
The depressed man turns with empty bloodshot eyes, in a harsh tone, ""What do you know of it, pretty boy?! It's easy to say that shit when you're so well off!""
The gentleman slaps his knee, ""Hah! Just three months ago I was right where you're sitting! There is a secret in this bar though... one that can change everything!""
Skeptical, the depressed man scoffed, ""Yeah, right. Sure...""
The gentleman stands up sharply and gestures to a window behind him, ""This here is a magical window. If you leap from it and make a wish on the way down, you will instantly pop back into this room and your wish will be granted!""
The depressed man drinks from his cheap whiskey and pretends to ignore the clearly insane ramblings.
Grinning, the gentleman walks to the window and opens it, ""Don't believe me? Fine, I'll prove it to you."" The gentleman begins to step out of the window...
In a state of shock, the depressed man stumbles to try and pull the lunatic from the open window, but he is too late! In a thundering clap, the entire bar shakes as a gust of wind rips through, clashing glasses and knocking over stools. To the depressed man's disbelief, the gentleman was back in the room standing near the pool tables!
In awe, the depressed man stutters, ""H...how... wh... what did you wish for?!.
With proud look the gentleman announced, ""I wished for superhuman strength!"" As he spoke, he grasped the side of the nearby pool table and lifted it high into the air with a single hand!
The depressed man still in shock looked back at the magic window, ""S... so all I need to do is c... climb out that window and make a wish??""
The gentleman nodded. Moving towards the window the depressed man was scared, but for the first time in months he was gripped by another emotion - hope. He looks out the window down 112 stories to the busy steers below. The people down below looked like ants trapped in a maze. The man hesitated and looked back. With one last nod from the gentleman, he let go of the windowsill.
After several moments the hard packing sound mixed with shattered glass and the screams of women rang out through the air.
The bartender, while cleaning the whiskey glass, says in a disapproving tone, ""That was fucked up, Superman.""",A depressed man walks into a bar...,106

Since I left for college I have been remiss in writing and I am sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay?

Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day. Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory, and my jump, was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Department and the Ambulance. He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It’s really a basement room, but it’s kind of cute. He is a very kind boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven’t got the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

Yes Mom &amp; Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection which prevents us from passing our pre-marital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have concussion or skull fracture, I was not in hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I am not infected and there is no boyfriend. However, I am getting a “D” in American History, and an “F” in Chemistry and I want you to see those marks in their proper perspective.

I had to get all of them back individually and only retrieved 99 of them. Now the last one... 

(at this point comes the tricky part. You have to credibly pretend that you don't remember the ending of this joke. Practice this - it's crucial. Sometimes it can help to say all the way at the start 'I'm not entirely sure anymore whether I remember this joke correctly, but I'm sure I'll get into it if I just start telling it'. Then it's more credible If you pretend to have forgotten it. ) 

The last tennis ball... No wait, let me think. Ah shit I think I don't remember how it went anymore. Oh but wait! I just remembered another one! Let me tell this one - it's a good joke. Maybe I'll remember the other one later. 

So a man is sitting on the train with his dog. He is sitting across from another man who is smoking a pipe. It annoys him, so he tells him 'excuse me sir, could you please stop smoking, it really bothers me.' the man does not respond at all. After a while the man becomes very annoyed and raises his voice a little: 'sir, could you PLEASE stop smoking your pipe'. Still no reaction. So after a little while, the man loses his temper, grabs the other man's pipe, and throws it out of the window of the moving train. The other man immediately responds by grabbing the dog of the first man, and throwing it out of the window as well. They soon arrive at the next station, and from the distance, the man sees his dog come running. And guess what he has in his mouth?

There was a businessman who was going on a long 
business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious
sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something
to keep her occupied while he was gone, because 
he didn't much like the idea of her screwing 
someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex
toys and started looking around. He thought about
a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to 
another man for him. 

He was browsing through the dildos, looking for 
something special to please his wife, and started
talking to the old man behind the counter. He 
explained his situation. The old man said, 'Well,
I don't really know of anything that will do the 
trick. We have vibrating dildos, special 
attachments, and so on, but I don't know of 
anything that will keep her occupied for weeks,
except -- ' and he stopped. 

'Except what?' the man asked. 

'Nothing, nothing.' 

'C'mon, tell me! I need something!' 

'Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but 
there is the 'voodoo dick.'' 

'So what's this voodoo dick?' he asked. 

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled
out an old wooden box, carved with strange 
symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very 
ordinary-looking dildo. 

The businessman laughed, and said, 'Big fucking
deal. It looks like every other dildo in this 
shop!' 

The old man replied, 'But you haven't seen what 
it'll do yet.' He pointed to a door and said, 
'Voodoo dick, the door.' 

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over
to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. 
The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a
crack developed down the middle. Before the door
could split, the old man said, 'Voodoo dick, get
back in your box!'

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box
and lay there, quiescent once more. 

'I'll take it!' said the businessman. The old man
resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he 
finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took
it home to his wife, told her it was a special 
dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was
say 'Voodoo dick, my pussy.' 

He left for his trip satisfied that things would 
be fine while he was gone. After he'd been gone a
few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She 
thought of several people who would willingly 
satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo 
dick. She got it out, and said, 'Voodoo dick, my 
pussy!' 

The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started 
pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever 
experienced before. After three orgasms, she 
decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it
out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. 

She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing
worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how
to shut it off. So she decided to go to the 
hospital to see if they could help. She put her
clothes on, got in the car and started to drive
to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of
the dildo. 

On the way, another orgasm nearly made her 
swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a
policeman. He asked for her license, and then 
asked how much she had to drink. 

Gasping and twitching, she explained that she 
hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was
stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. 
The officer looked at her for a second, and then 
said: 

'Yeah, right......... Voodoo dick, my ass!'

He came round the next day to look at my shower in the morning on my day off work. He told me that one of the pipes had came loose and he needed to put the right one back in. He seemed nice, we had a conversation about where he came from. He said he came from Berlin in Germany and then smiled at went back to work. Later on, he said it was finished and I gave him my money. I wake up the next day ready to go to work. I walk into the shower, turn it on, nothing. It's not working. I get a headache all of a sudden from the frustration and stress going through my head. I have to go to work, smelling like this. So I man up, spray what can only be described as a shit ton of deodorant on me to hopefully mask the smell of B.O.

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Also is a dream I made up. 

Ok, after all of that, we get to take a shower, have some fruits, the pizza pockets are finally out of the microwave, immediately put them back inside, because 8 minutes wasn't enough, finished my tax return, and was finally able to kick back and relax for the weekend.!

Neville remembered what he forgot! He was a full grown adult and they were 8 year old children. He happened upon a slight hill that went down to an old field. On the far edge of the field, they saw a perfectly sized table. But the table was set. There were sandwiches, chips, already cooked hot dogs still sizzling on the grill, and drinks galore.

Curious the bank manager asks how an old Lady earned such a huge amount of money. She tells him ""I  earned this money by making odd bets, for example I bet you all the money in this suit case that you have square balls"" 

The manager thought that's an impossible bet to win and says I'll take you on that. The old Lady told him let's meet up tomorrow in this same office and left for the day.

The next day the Lady had arrived with the suitcase and a man in a suit. They both entered the Managers office and he asked who the man was. She said that this was her lawyer and he was here to witness the bet. 

She told the Manager to take his pants off so that she could examine his balls. The Manager thought this made sense and obliged. After thoroughly examining his balls the old Lady came to the conclusion that his balls were indeed round and not  square. 

She gave the Manager the suit case and as he took his reward he saw the lawyers face in awe. He then asked the lawyer why he looked so grim and the old Lady said ""I bet him $700,000 that I would have the balls of a high end bank manager in my hands in his office today.""

So the bartender, puts an apple on the bar before him. Confused the man looks at the bartender wondering if this is some kind of joke. Before he can ask, the bartender already knows to explain. 

""In this bar I have an apple with every flavor in the world, trust me, go ahead and see for yourself, take a bite.""

So the man, hesitantly bites into the apple. ""Wow, that tastes like Crown""

The Bartender replies, ""Now turn it around""

So he does, ""That tastes like Red Bull, wow that's amazing.""

It's not long until another guy comes in and sits next to the first man. ""I'm waiting on a friend, but go ahead and give me a Coke and Rum""

Again, the bartender, places an apple in front of this second man. 

""What the fuck is this?"" the man asks upset

The first guy says ""Trust him, take a bite""

So he takes a bite of the apple, ""That tastes like rum."" 

""now turn it around"" he says to the second man.

He turns it around and takes another bite, ""Well I'll be damned, that tastes like Coke.""

The second man apologizes for getting upset and the bartender fills him in about the apples. A few moments later, the second guy's friend comes in and is greeted by him.

""Dude, you won't believe this, the bartender has an apple of every flavor in the world, sit down and order something.""

The friend sits down, and with a smug grin on his face goes ""...I want pussy."" 


The bartender sets the apple down in front of him and the guy takes a bite, he almost immediately spits it out. 

""What the fuck, this tastes like ass!"" 


The Bartender says, ""Turn it around""

""Look, I tend to keep this to myself, but over in that closet there is a genie who will grant you one wish. Maybe he can help you out.""

So the man heads over to the closet. Inside it's larger than he expected and there was actually two people inside. One sat on the left, looking rather shady and smoking a cigar. The other sat to the right. He was a very small man and was playing a familiar tune on an equally small piano. The man decided to try his luck on the left. 

""Are you the genie?"" Asked the man. ""Can you help me?""

""Sure."" Replied the man. ""Why not. I'll grant you one wish.""

""Well in that case I suppose I wish for a million bucks.""

The man snapped his fingers and all of a sudden there were ducks everywhere. They were running about the floor, walking on the tables, they were everywhere. The man knew it was too good to be true and fought his way back into the bar.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. 

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant. 

This is for everyone who sends me those heart-warming bullshit stories. ","In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.",149

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. 

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. 

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. 

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.  

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:
