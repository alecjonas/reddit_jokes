He has small horn-rimmed glasses and the classic Larry David hairline. When he gives you a little half-smile in greeting you notice that his teeth are very white and perfectly straight, a trait that stands out from the mans overall shabby appearance. He politely introduces himself as Tim, and informs you that he's here about the blowjob.

It takes you a few seconds to process the information. ""Excuse me?""

""From the coupon code? You tried it on our website?"" His perfect teeth flash again.

""Right. Ok, yeah."" Your brain train has rumbled into the station, but the conductor is drunk at the controls. You're confused. ""That couldn't have been real.""

""Oh, quite real!"" He nods enthusiastically. ""It's a popular code.""

""But it didn't even go through!"" You protest.

""It did, it's just that only the second half of the code was functional."" Tim says with another nod.

You stand there for a few seconds and stare at the man. You're not gay. You're not even Bi. But it's been a slow month. Or two. Or six. Hell, Tim's the first person you've even talked to in over a week. You crave interaction. Attention. And most of all, release. Could you really be considering this? But before you've realized it you've let him in and shut the door behind you.

""Alright. Let's do this."" Shyly you shimmy your basketball shorts down and kick them aside. ""I haven't taken a shower in a day or two, though.""

Tim looks at you confused. ""Why do you need to take a shower to give a blowjob?""",You use the coupon code 100percentoffandablowjob,0

It takes heavy liberties with the cymbal part. Joe is ecstatic; cymbal players rarely ever get the recognition they deserve. This could be a revolution in the music industry!

They begin tuning and setting up to start the jam session. All of a sudden, the tuning is drowned out by the obnoxious sound of Joe murdering his cymbals. Dave, annoyed, turns to Joe and says, “can you quit it? Your instrument doesn’t even require tuning.” Joe, miffed, shakes his head quietly and stops.

They begin the song and hit it off immediately, except for one small issue. Joe cannot seem to get in rhythm with the rest of the band, and the tempo is suffering for it. Tommy, annoyed, turns to Joe and says, “can you pay attention? It’s not that hard to hit a cymbal on key.” Joe, quickly losing confidence, shakes his head and adjusts his instrument.

The whole band is playing in tempo and the song is going quite well. Joe gets his solo, and he plays the single note with artistry. Towards the end, the entire song is interrupted by loud sobbing. Rodney, infuriated, turns to a teary-eyed Joe and says, “can you stop crying? Your cymbal part isn’t even that emotional.” Joe, all soul devoid from his eyes, shakes his head and grabs a tissue.

At the end of the rehearsal, their first recording in the bag, the band gathers to reflect on what they’ve accomplished. Rodney, the established frontman of the band, looks at each of them and asks, “what additions or suggestions do you have to make the band even better?”

Immediately, both Dave and Tommy chime in.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",My favorite (old) joke: Everyone Knows Dave,157

He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.

An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him.

The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, “What kind of car ya got there, sonny?”

The doctor replies, “A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!”

“That’s a lot of money,” says the old man. “Why does it cost so much?”

“Because this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!” states the doctor proudly.

The moped driver asks, “Mind if I take a look inside?”

“No problem,” replies the doctor.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.

Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, “That’s a pretty nice car, all right, but I’ll stick with my moped!”

Just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.

He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph.

Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror – what it could be…and suddenly…

WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH!

Something whips by him going much faster!

“What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?” the doctor asks himself.

He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 175 mph.

Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it’s the old man on the moped!

Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph.

WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH!

He’s feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN!

Astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 250 mph.

Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

The Ferrari is flat out, and there’s nothing he can do!

Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

The doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive.

He runs up to the mangled old man and says, “Oh my gosh! Is there anything I can do for you?”

Dave Blanchfield was one such person. Dave worked for an insurance firm based in the “Windy City”, and had recently booked a trip to the Bahamas, 

On the 27th of December, Dave got up early and drove to the airport. He checked in his baggage, cleared security, and made his way to his gate. Half an hour later he boarded the plane, and waited for takeoff. As his plane was taking off, Dave noticed a magazine placed in front of his seat. Bored as he was, he decided to flip through. One particular advertisement within the magazine caught his eye. Scuba Diving Trip $50. Dave had always dreamed of going Scuba Diving, and at such low a price, he couldn’t resist the idea. He decided that he would book the next available Diving Trip as soon as he landed. 

When the plane landed, Dave rushed out, hailed a cab, and gave the driver directions. The cab driver obliged him, and less than 10 minutes later they had pulled up to a dock with a shack in front of it. Dave paid his fare and went up to to the shack to inquire about the Scuba Trip. He knocked on the door, which was opened by a tall Nordic man. “When is the next Scuba Trip?”, Dave inquired. “Well, I haven’t had many customers in a while, so I guess I could fit you in right now”, responded the Nordic Diver. Dave was eager to dive, and gave the man $50.

After filling out the necessary paperwork, the Diver gave Dave instructions on how the gear worked, and before long, they were on a boat heading toward their diving destination. After they were about a kilometer off of the coast, the Diver stalled the boat, and the pair of them dove off. 

As they went deeper, Dave saw fish of all kind, fish more colorful than you could ever imagine. The Diver led Dave deeper an Deeper, until they had reached the ocean floor. The Diver tapped Dave on the shoulder and pointed East. Dave turned his head and saw the most magnificent thing. A yellow school bus was lying on the ocean floor, frozen in time. And drawn on the bus was a beautiful mermaid, with the biggest breasts that Dave had ever seen. Dave was getting aroused just by the mere sight of the drawing. The Diver tapped him on the shoulder again, and signaled that it was time to go back up to the surface.

When they got back to the surface, Dave thanked the Diver for the Diving Trip, and inquired about the drawing of the mermaid. “Well”, the Diver said, “that mermaid isn’t just a fictional drawing. The mermaid actually exists.” “Every night, the mermaid appears here, on this very dock, and if you bring her a pearl, she will give you a blowjob in return"". Dave thinks this is quite ridiculous and drives off to his hotel room in the city.

As the day goes on, Dave cannot help thinking about the story the Diver has told him. He was sure that it was pure nonsense, but he couldn’t resist the idea of that mermaid giving him a blowjob. He resolved to go to the dock at night to see if the Diver’s story was true.

At 11 pm, Dave went to the market, bought a fake pearl, and drove to the dock. He looked around, and lo and behold, the mermaid was lying on the dock. Dave felt himself getting hard. He walked over to the mermaid, fake pearl in hand, and knelt down to give it to her. The mermaid took it, smiled, and began unzipping his fly. Dave stood in awe, letting the mermaid do what the Diver said she would do. 

As she finished, Dave said, “I have a confession to make. The pearl is fake. I am truly sorry.” 

The mermaid said, “That’s alright, I also have a confession. I’m not really a mermaid. I’m the Bus Diver!”",December in Chicago,1

One day, Merv decided to invest his money in a small, but growing telecom business called R. Jokes Communications.

After weeks of negotiations, he bought the company outright. 

But, after signing on the dotted line, he realized that he knew nothing about running such a business and quickly set out to hire someone who could do that for him.

The next day he had set up three interviews.

The first guy was great.

 He knew everything he needed to and was very interesting.

At the end of the interview, Merv asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

And the gentleman answered, “Why yes, I couldn’t help but notice you have no ears.” 

Merv got very angry and threw him out.

The second interview was with a woman and she was even better than the first guy.

He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?” and she replied, “Well, you have no ears.” 

Merv again was upset and tossed her out.

The third and last interview was the best of all three.

It was with a very young man who was fresh out of college. 

He was smart.

He was handsome. 

And he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together.

Merv was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?” 

And to his surprise, the young man answered, “Yes. You wear contact lenses.”

Merv was shocked and said, “What an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that?”

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no ears!”","Merv was in a terrible accident at work.

The bear pulls out his dick and starts beating the rabbit on his back. The rabbit cried a lot, but after some moments, he starts laughing. 

The bear was confused and starts beating him more and faster, but the rabbit is still laughing, so the bear gave all his strength to beat the rabbit, but he won't stop laughing.

Johnny thinks and thinks for about 3mins, then replies: Oh that’s easy, it’s red. 

Here’s how I got to it. 

A fire truck has 6 wheels. 
6 times 2 is 12. 
12 made me think of a dozen, a dozen made me think of eggs, eggs makes me think of a hen and a hen makes me think of a rooster. 

There’s a rooster on the church tower. The church tower is high, opposite of high is deep. 

Deep in the ocean there are fish. Fish have fins and in 1827 the Finnish attacked the Philistines and their flag was red.","Little Johnny is in 1st grade, but extremely smart.",9

As soon as it was paid for and fastened around her neck, she felt paranoid, like she was being watched.








She was right.  As she was getting into her car, she saw a blinding light and collapsed to the ground, as a thug hit her across the back of her head with a brick.  She didn't completely lose consciousness, and she kept waiting for the next blow, a gunshot, or someone to rip her new necklace from around her neck.

That never happened though, but she heard the sounds of fighting and yelling. She blinked and saw a passerby on his phone, describing the scene to who she assumed was 911.   

She looked in the direction of all the commotion, and came to the conclusion that she must have been in worse shape than she thought, as she couldn't believe what she was seeing.  There were *four* people who had been trying to rob her, but instead, they wear all fighting this...well...midget, to be politically incorrect.  But this guy was amazing - he looked every bit the hero.  Tight spandex outfit (had he just come from the gym?), Muscles rippling everywhere, even topped off the look with long flowing hair.  The victim stared in amazement as her hero moved deftly, struck with amazing strength, and eventually incapacitated all 4 of the villains that had ruined her day - the mystery rescuer took quite a beating at first - he *was* outnumbered 4 to 1, plus there was the size difference - but he managed to leave all 4 of the bad guys groaning and slumped against a fence when the police showed up (of course) just as he finished.  

Meanwhile our victim was being tended to by the citizen who had called the police.  She asked, ""where did he come from?  I didn't see him before they knocked me down, but then instead of me getting killed or robbed, he's defending and saving me"". The bystander said he saw her get hit, then the fight, but he had no idea where the guy came from or who he was.

The medics tended to the victim while the cops rounded up the would-be robbers and spoke with the manager who had beat them all to a pulp.  After talking for a bit, one of the cops asked him point blank, ""so who are you?  Can we get your name for the report?"". Another nearby officer interrupted, ""Hey, hey, calm down.  He got smacked around a lot too - the second ambulance just pulled up and he probably needs to get checked out - looks like that black eye really hurts.""

The mystery superhero turned to both the officers and answered, ""well I have to admit, I'm a little Thor.""

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota .""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.’",THE salesman story.,823

The Canadian woodpecker accepted his challenge and promptly pecked a hole in the tree with no problem. The Mexican woodpecker was amazed.

The Canadian woodpecker then challenged the Mexican woodpecker to peck a tree in Canada that was absolutely 'impeckable' (a term frequently used by woodpeckers ). The Mexican woodpecker expressed confidence that he could do it and accepted the challenge.

The two flew to Canada where the Mexican woodpecker successfully pecked the so-called 'impeckable' tree almost without breaking a sweat.

Both woodpeckers were now terribly confused. How is it that the Canadian woodpecker was able to peck the Mexican tree, and the Mexican woodpecker was able to peck the Canadian tree, yet neither was able to peck the tree in their own country?

After much woodpecker pondering, they both came to the same conclusion: Apparently, your pecker gets harder when you're away from home",A Mexican woodpecker and a Canadian woodpecker,71

post,9wy34e,2qh72,jokes,false,1542182108,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9wy34e/a_comedian_was_on_vacation_in_london/,self.jokes,,"A comedian was on a vacation in London when he came across a large crowd. He pushed and squeezed his way past the ocean of people and saw the Royal Family who were on their way to have lunch. As he takes out his phone to snap a photo, he saw from the corner of his eye a shady man pushing past the crowd. The comedian, having a gut feeling of a bad omen, walked towards the stranger who pushed past the security and ran straight to the Queen. With his quick reflexes, the comedian jumped and tackled the attacker, knocking him down and subduing him long enough for the guards to seize him. 

The Royal Family, grateful for the comedian's heroicism, thanked the comedian while the crowd applauded. The Queen, not wanting his effort go to waste, offered anything in return. The comedian denied her gifts and rewards, but the Queen was persistent. In her last effort, she offered him a dinner at the very least in the royal palace itself. The comedian mulled it over, and as he had no plans for the night anyway, accepted her offer.

He was not able to wear anything half decent to the dinner. The guards mistook him for a beggar at first before the prince came by to grant him entry. When they entered the main hall, he was mesmerised by the extravagant display. Rare antique paintings line the walls, while a huge glistering crystal chandelier hung above them. It reflected every colour of the spectrum, casting rainbows everywhere. The prince led him to the dining hall where the dinner will take place.

Right as they enter the dining hall, a group of high-ranking officials paraded the comedian with applause, something he could never say about his comedy career. He was escorted by a butler towards his seat, right across the crown prince and heir to the throne. 

The Queen began the dinner with a greeting to all. She acknowledged the presence of their saviour from earlier, this simple comedian, for his act of courage which saved them all. She went on about the duties of a knight, likening them to the bravery of this comedian. 

As he was getting bored by the Queen's long message, his eyes wandered off to scan the dinner table. An elegant, skillfully woven piece of tapestry lay atop the expensive ebony table. The plates were of the highest quality, luxurious enough to make the lamest meals look like gourmet. The cutlery were shining, absolute fine silverware and crafted to perfection. His eyes met the prince's plate, which was peculiarly out of place. It was but a cheap paper plate, the ones that can be bought in bulk for spare change. He was using disposable utensils, made of plastic that looks like it would snap the moment the prince applied force on it. Likewise, the princess was using the same cheap dinnerware, and seemed to be perfectly fine with it while the rest of the esteemed guests used the most expensive ones.

The royal chefs enter the room carrying on their silver platters their meals for the night. It was the most exquisite steak the comedian has ever seen, smeared with sauce infused with herbs and spices from God knows where- this was their dinner. Behind the head chef was a line of assistants carrying individual side dishes to the guests and royal family. Their glasses were filled with expensive wine, emitting a strong scent. 

Meanwhile, a pair of lower-ranking cooks assisted the prince and princess with their food. They were having basic, poorly made spaghetti. The cooks sloppily scoop the sauce on top of their noodles, making a mess while they did.

The Queen offered a toast to begin the dinner. The chattering of the guest died down as they began to enjoy their meals. The comedian is still bothered by the two heirs, who are eating such simple meals while no one bats an eye. While the others ate, he silently stared at the prince and princess eat their meals.

The comedian leaned over to the Queen and asked, ""So what's the deal with the heir line food?""",A comedian was on vacation in London.,14

Their favorite spot takes them almost a quarter of a day to walk to, being turtles and all. When the two turtles get to their favorite spot, they're starving! They can't wait to dig in. As they're getting their picnic set up, one of the turtles says ""I can't find the bottle opener. I can't have a nice picnic without my beer!"" The other turtle says ""why don't you go back home and get the bottle opener?"" He responds ""I don't want you to start eating without me."" The other turtle says ""that's fine, I'll wait. Just go."" So he does.

The turtle waits patiently for his friend to come back with the bottle opener before he eats. Four hours pass, and the turtle hasn't returned yet. ""It's a long trip"" thinks the turtle, still patiently waiting.

Eight hours go by. Nine. Ten. The whole day goes by, and the turtle STILL isn't back with the bottle opener. The turtle waiting is wondering where his friend is, and at this point he is absolutely starved. ""Forget it,"" he says. ""If I don't eat, I'll starve to death!"" So he starts to dig in. Just as the turtle is about to start eating his food, the turtle that left for the bottle opener jumps out of the bushes and yells ""I knew it! I'm not fucking going!""",Turtle Picnic,37

The old man slowly reached over and pushed the camel's testicles to one side and then released them, letting them swing to a stop. ""10:27"" he said. 

The archaeologist was stunned as he had never seen someone tell time like that before. He rushed back to the hotel to find his colleagues and then brought them back to the town square to find the old man. 

Having found him again, the archaeologist said, ""I will give you this $50 bill if you'll show me how you tell time."" 

The old man pocketed the $50 bill and said, ""OK, kneel down here with me and put your head close to mine. Now swing the camel's testicles out of the way. Now, can you see the clock on that building over there?""",An archaeologist in Egypt was taking a walk in the town square one morning.,7

""Sorry, I've fallen on hard times myself. I had to sell all of my horses!""

The cowboy noticed a rather strange-looking steed standing right in the stable behind the keeper, a horse with matted, mangy fur, a deranged, glazed-over look in his eye and a stiff, motionless stance that would have made him look more like taxidermy than a living animal if it hadn't been for the occasional twitch.

""How much for that one?"" the cowboy asked.

The stable keeper shook his head. ""Trust me. You do NOT want that horse. I got him from a real shady-lookin' preacher one day. I don't know what that man did to him, but all's I know is that the horse ain't right. Never has been.""

The cowboy had his doubts, but he was desperate, and insisted on buying the horse despite the stable keeper's warnings. The keeper let him have the horse for free, as he couldn't bring himself to charge money for such a defective creature in good conscience. Before sending him on his way, the keeper gave the cowboy some instructions:

""As I said, this horse ain't right. He's completely unresponsive to everything except for two specific sentences. To make him go, you have to say 'Thank you Jesus!' To make him stop, you say 'Hallelujah!' In all honesty I can only hope the Lord is riding with 'ya tonight, 'cause otherwise... Well... Just be careful, okay?""

The cowboy excitedly hopped on his new horse, ready to ride off into town. Remembering what the old stable keeper told him, he shouted ""Thank you, Jesus!"" and instantly the horse went from standing to top speed in a second, nearly giving the cowboy whiplash!

Onward the horse galloped, smashing into fences and bushes that didn't slow it down for a second, dashing in a straight line even after missing its first turn a long time ago. It almost seemed a miracle that there were no trees directly in the way, because the horse would have surely ran into one.

The cowboy instantly regretted his decision, and in his panic he'd forgotten which phrase made the horse stop. Then, to his horror, he realized that the horse was heading full-speed off the edge of an incredibly steep cliff. The cowboy began frantically pulling on the reins, screaming all the religious phrases he could think of to try and halt the beast, but to no avail. Suddenly, when all hope seemed lost, he remembered at the last minute:

""HALLELUJAH!!!""

And instantly the horse froze, a single inch away from the edge of the cliff.

The cowboy was trembling and drenched in sweat. He had never been so close to certain doom. With a sigh of relief, he wiped his brow, looked up to the heavens and said:

""Thank you, Jesus!""",A cowboy's horse died on his way to town...,92

 In the middle of a forest, there was a hunter who was suddenly confronted by a huge, mean bear.   


In  his fear, all attempts to shoot the bear were unsuccessful. Finally, he  turned and ran as fast as he could. The hunter ran and ran and ran,  until he ended up at the edge of a very steep cliff. His hopes were dim.    


Seeing no way out of his predicament, and with the bear closing  in rather quickly, the hunter got down on his knees, opened his arms,  and exclaimed, ""Dear God! Please give this bear some religion!""   


The  skies darkened and there was lightning in the air. Just a few feet  short of the hunter, the bear came to abrupt stop, and glanced around,  somewhat confused.  


Suddenly, the bear looked up into the sky and said, ""Thank you God, for the food I'm about to receive...""

The father was always strict to discipline him when he saw him acting up. Well, he eventually came home with the fish he had caught and his wife cooked them, and eventually supper was ready. So they’re all eating together when the fathers says to the wife:

“What’s that honey?” Said the mom

“I want some of those Dam fish.”

""Unbelievable, you're absolutely correct. How do you know all this about me?""

""Well,"" the professor says, ""I observed there was a dog house in your backyard, so you must have a dog. I also saw bicycles next to your garage, so you must have children.

She is still mocked constantly because of her not so ordinary name. She comes home from school one day, obviously disturbed. I ask her if it's about her name. She says nothing and just kisses me on the cheek and leaves. First time she has kissed me since she was a baby. Just wasn't her thing. Then, I hear my wife pulling in. She is home early from work. I hear the door open from daughter's room. The door then opens from garage. Loud blast goes off directly behind me. I fall to the ground. Wife looks at me and screams.

Her biggest insecurity was always the way her vagina looked. She had rather large pussy lips (labia minora). Occasionally, she would be rejected by a client because of the way her lady bits looked, and she seeked the advice of a surgeon.

""Sure, we can reduce the amount of external flesh and create a more aesthetically appealing area in the process. Just know that the procedure will result in a lengthy healing process,"" the doctor said after a thorough examination. 

""Please, doctor. I need this,"" the woman said.

The procedure went very successfully. No complications, sutures in the right places, everything was shaping up to heal quicker than expected.

When the woman woke up, she had 3 bouquets next to her bed. The first was a modest 6 roses and a card. The card read ""To my daughter, I hope your recovery is swift. We may have our differences, but I will always love you. - Mom."" The second bouquet was 2 dozen beautiful roses and also had a card. This card read ""I can't wait to see that delicious slot when it's healed. I'll triple the usual rate to have first crack at it! - #1 John."" There was a third bouquet that had a dozen roses, a dozen daffodils, a dozen sunflowers, and 2 dozen lillies, and countless protea blooms. But there was no card accompanying it. 

Her doctor came in to follow up on the surgery and after examining her, she said ""Excuse me, doc? I know who these two gifts came from, but there wasn't a card for the third. I don't know who to thank for the gesture. Would you happen to know who sent these?"" 

The doctor smiled and looked at his feet, as if slightly embarrassed. ""Well, ma'am. When we copied your ID for record keeping, we saw you were an organ donor.

They agree that Pan and the Lost Boys will stay mostly on the mainland, and Hook and the Pirates will stay out to sea, only coming to port for supplies at Tiger Lily's tribe. However, the only thing the two can't agree upon is how far Hook and crew will be able to venture inland for trade. Hook wants to be able to go to the village proper, and Pan thinks they should only be allowed on the area where they dock.

&amp;#x200B;

To settle this, they agree to a debate, with the Chief as the moderator. Pan consults the Darling children, the Lost Boys, the mermaids... anyone he can think of to support his argument. Hook consults with Smee and his crew.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the day arrives and Pan eloquently delivers his point of view, countering each of Hook's points brilliantly and in a way that would make Michael Darling quite proud. However, at the end of it all, Hook merely snarls, sticks out his tongue and smirks knowingly at the Chief.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly, the Chief sides with Hook and allows him into the village, to the dismay of Pan and Tiger Lily. After Hook leaves smugly, Pan walks up to the Chief. ""Chief,"" he says, "" I thought I had done really well today, using words to fight instead of my knife and hands. Everyone in the crowd appears to have been on my side. Tell me... what did Hook say that convinced you?""

&amp;#x200B;

The Chief looked at Pan and, after a moment's thought, replied ""Well, on one hand, you did have a very good argument and countered his points skillfully. On the other hand, Hook had a point.""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,
