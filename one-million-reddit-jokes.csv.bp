The woman is at first taken aback but after a moment realizes she might as well make the kid happy in their final moments. She passionately kisses him. 

The boy, elated, goes on, “Sorry to bother you again after such a lovely kiss, but we might die and I’ve never felt a breast.” 

Again the woman is taken aback but decides there is no harm in it and slides his hand under her shirt. 

After a good long feel, the boy again says “you’ve been so kind already but please, I don’t want to die never having gotten a blow job.”

Already committed to helping this boy have new experiences before they die, the woman smiles and begins to undo his belt. Just then the plane levels off.

As everyone exits the plane they shake hands with the captain and congratulate him. The woman walks off the plain she says “thank you so much for saving us from certain death.”

The father eventually wants his son to take over the business and has tried to teach him the ins and outs of woodworking, along with other important lessons he thinks that every carpenter should know.

“The most m’portant thang,” the father always reminds his son in his heavy country accent, “is to know yer tools and ta make sure ev’ry tool has a place.”

True to his statement, the father has his tools in immaculate order. Each one has its place and he even has each tool labeled so that it’s easy to find and can be returned to the proper place when it is not in use. Over the years, he has perfected his labeling system and can name a tool just by reading the double-lettered code he has assigned to it.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,82

This was not the end of their adventures and they continued traveling the land for many years performing incredible feats with the occasional misstep. During one such misstep, they ran afoul of a powerful witch and were both cursed in different ways. John Price grew to well over 9 feet tall while James Pricing shrank till he was barely over a foot tall.  
With their adventuring careers effectively ended, they returned home to their village to live out the rest of their days. As they sat in John Price's house a neighbor noticed the lamps in Price's house were lit. Having always had an open invitation, the neighbor ran over and opened the door. Seeing only the hulking John Price, he closed the door and immediately ran off to find someone to tell.  
Not knowing that he had been seen, Price had adjourned to another room leaving Pricing alone as the neighbor brought the mayor to the house. ""I must warn you,"" said the neighbor, ""There is a huge Sir Price on the other side of this door."" The mayor slowly opened the door, looked inside and saw the diminutive James Pricing sitting alone. Closing the door, the mayor told the neighbor, ""Oh, I don't know about that.

On the third hole he had just scored his first ever hole-in-one when his cell phone rang... it was a doctor notifying him that his wife had just been in an accident and was in critical condition in the ICU.

The man told the doctor to inform his wife where he was and that he'd be there as soon as possible. As he hung up he realized he was leaving what was shaping up to be his best ever round of golf.

He decided to get in a couple of more holes before heading to the hospital. He ended up playing all eighteen, finishing his round shooting a personal best 61, shattering the club record by five strokes and beating his previous best game by more than 10. He was jubilant...

Then he remembered his wife. Feeling guilty he dashed to the hospital. He saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about his wife's condition.

The doctor glared at him and shouted, ""You went ahead and finished your round of golf didn't you! I hope you're proud of yourself!""

""While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself at the country club your wife has been languishing in the ICU! It's just as well you went ahead and finished that round because it will be more than likely your last! For the rest of her life she will require round the clock care and you will be her care giver! She will need IV's; you will have to change her colostomy bag every 3 hours; she will have to be spoon fed 3 times a day and don't forget the hygiene care.""

The man was feeling so guilty he broke down and sobbed...

After a decade, he returned, after instructing the natives to perform a musical show for the people. The show starts, and it sounds great! Everyone is rocking out to the traditional drums + bass + guitar band they got set up, and then the drummer starts a solo. He hits those skins real hard for a long while, and when he starts to settle down, the crowd starts chanting ""Bu gu! Bu gu! Bu gu!"" The philanthropist asks what the meaning of Bu Gu is, and is told ""Bu Gu mean don't stop."" So he figures these people really love their drums, shrugs, and continues to listen. However, things are getting odd... Every time the solo winds down, the crowd keeps cheering him on with their chants. The problem is, this is been going for half a day. And then a day. And then two. The philanthropist is astounded, and is hungry and tired, but he stays there out of sheer curiosity. Surely, all the other people are tired and hungry too, why don't they just stop telling the drummer to go on? Finally he cracks and says ""We've been here for three days, everyone is hungry, tired, and thirsty! Why don't you tell the drummer to stop?!"" They reply: ""Drum solo no stop."" ""WHY?!"", he asks.

When the intended victim - almost always male - has loaded their shopping into their car they are approached by two or three female teenagers who will ask or beg for help. The story is usually that one is trying to get away from an abusive older boyfriend or that they have been at a party where their phones were stolen, and they will ask for a ride. They will be very convincing, often crying and pleading to be taken to the police station or anywhere.

Once they are in the car, one will make advances on you, pretending to be grateful and wanting to repay you in sexual favours. They may offer you a threesome, or simply start making out in your car. Once they have convinced you to join them, while one or more of them are engaged in sexual activity with you, another will steal your wallet, cellphone and any other valuables they can get.

Cases have been reported in various locations around the country, including at my local mall, where this happened to me last month, twice last week and again tomorrow.",Latest scam warning.,66

When he went to the post office to send the letter, he met the mail deliverer Kurt. Kurt said he would deliver the letter.

The man waited a few days and went back to the post office since he didn't receive a letter back. He saw Kurt and asked him if he delivered the letter. Kurt said he tried to, but no one answered or took the letter, so he brought it back the next day.

The man was upset that his daughter ignored him. He left a copy of the same letter every single day at the post office, in the hopes that she would answer one of them someday.

Kurt noticed the man sending letter after letter, day by day, for months. His curiosity got the better of him after some time, and he decided to read one of the letters before delivering it. He was astounded at how useful the man's advice was and decided this was worth sharing with everyone, so he called up a local newspaper company.

The newspaper company sent a reporter to come speak with Kurt, who told them, ""A man sent the same letter every day for months to his daughter, who never answered the letters. Read the letter! It has some very good information that could help the whole world out.""

The reporter, instead of being interested in what the letter said, was interested in the man's dedication of sending the same letter every day to someone who never responded. The reporter wrote an article and sent it to Kurt to look at before publishing.


When Kurt looked at it, he said, ""It's Outrageous! The Reposting gets more attention than the Original content !""","A man had an adult daughter who he loved dearly but rarely met. He decided to send her a letter, and in it was hundreds of pieces of advice to help her succeed in life.",20

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter. 
In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. 
Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. 
Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent ""e"" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.

Thinking that it was just a phase, his father didn't worry too much about it and hoped that one day his son would grow up.

However, one day his son came home with terrible news: ""Dad, I've made up my mind I'm going vegetarian!""

He could accept anything else, but that! Shocked, he threw his son out of his house.

As the months and years went by, he regretted his decision, and decided that maybe he should try to understand his son's point of view. So he read up about the nutritional value of plants, looked up recipes, and even asked the neighbouring squirrels about what they ate.

Finally, one cold evening, he decided that it was time to try out eating plants. Peas were a good place to start- they were high in protein, like the rotting flesh he usually ate, and they were easy for him to eat with his beak. So in addition to his usual plate of roadkill, he put on a pot of peas to boil.

Suddenly there was a knock at the door. He opened it and gasped with surprise- there was his son, thin as sticks and weak as water! His son collapsed into his wings, and managed to croak out,

""Dad, I'm starving. Do you have anything for me to eat?""

Crying at seeing his long-lost child after so many years, he nodded and said,

""Carrion, my wayward son! There'll be peas when you are done.""",There was a vulture who had a rebellious son.,92

The man told me that he had a son, for whom he cared about deeply, so much so that for his 15th birthday, he offered him anything he wanted in the world.

In response, the son said 
“Thank you father, but I believe I already have enough. I don’t require anything else... except maybe one thing...”

The father said
“Yes, anything! If you want it, it is yours! You just have to ask.”

The son replied
“Alright... I would like...a ping pong ball, please”

“A...ping pong ball?”

“Yes. More specifically, a green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball. Just one will do.”

The father was obviously confused, but did what his son asked. The next day, the son unwrapped his only present, and found the green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball that he had asked for. He was delighted, and he took the ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. After a few hours, the he emerged. The ping pong ball was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with it, or why he wanted it.

One year later, and it’s the boys 16th birthday. Again, the father tells him that he can have anything he wants, he simply has to ask.

“Well father, you are very kind, but I believe I already have enough. I require nothing else... except maybe one thing.”

“Whatever you want, son”

“Well... I would like... a pack of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please.”

The father was again very confused, but again follows his sons wishes. The next morning, the son opened his only present, a pack of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. Again, the boy was delighted, and again he took the pack of ping pong balls up to his room, locking himself inside. He emerged hours later. The pack of ping pong balls was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the boys 17th birthday. The father offers him anything we wants, again”

“Father, I know I already have a lot, but... could I please have a pallet of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls?”

The father is beginning to see a trend, but nonetheless gets him what he wants. The next day, the boy opens his only present, a pallet of green, pink and purple ping pong balls. The boy was delighted as always, and he took the pallet of ping pong balls up to his room, locking himself inside. Hours later, he emerged. The pallet was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with it, or why he wanted it.

One year later, and it’s the boys 18th birthday. Before the father can even make the offer, the boy says 

“A truck full of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please!”

The father is now seriously concerned, but nevertheless follows his sons wishes. The next day, a truck rolls up to the family mansion, filled with hundreds of pallets of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. The boy is delighted, and as expected, he takes the truckload of ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. Hours later, he emerges.
Every last pallet is gone. The boy never mentions what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the boys 19th birthday.

“A warehouse of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please!”

At this point, the father is thinking about hiring a doctor, but nevertheless he follows his sons wishes. The next day, he takes his son to a warehouse filled with millions of pallets of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. The son (as expected) is delighted, and he locks himself inside the warehouse. Hours later, he emerges, Every last pallet is gone. The boy never mentions what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the day before the boys 20th birthday. He’s driving along the road, lost in the thought of the green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball factory he is going to ask for. In fact, he is so lost in thought that he misses a red light, and collides straight into another car.

The boy is taken to hospital. His injuries are severe. The nurses say he won’t have much longer to live. As he lies in the hospital bed, his father comes to visit him. 

“Oh no, my boy... my dear sweet boy...”

After a few minutes of crying, the father finally decides to ask

“My son... we both know you may not have much time left in this world... so please, answer me honestly... what did you do with those green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls?”

The son smiles

“Ah yes...those wonderful green.... purple... and pink polka dot... ping pong balls. Father, I think it’s time. I think that I’m going to tell you now. There’s no use hiding it any longer. You see, the reason I wanted those green, pink and purple polka dot ping balls... what I did with them... the truth is-“

and then the boy dies.

St. Peter looks alarmed, and says ""You must NEVER step on a duck! Those are God's favorite! If you step on a duck, you'll be punished for all eternity!""  

The three are left to their own devices, but inevitably one of them steps on a duck. After much quacking ensued, St. Peter sternly marches up and handcuffs the offender to the ugliest woman the three have ever seen. ""You were warned! Now you're attached to her for all eternity!""  

The other two are now much more careful about trying to avoid stepping on ducks, but as luck would have it, one of them manages to do so, to the same scenario with an even uglier woman.  

The remaining man is so careful he can hardly move, but manages to go for several years without stepping on a duck.  

In spite of this, he sees St. Peter sternly approaching him with a woman and a pair of handcuffs. But the woman isn't ugly, she's drop-dead gorgeous!

He silently grabs his pistol, making sure that he doesn't get noticed by his wife and her lover, and prepares to shoot them both.

Suddenly, a few thoughts come to his mind. He started to remember the previous six months.

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason, his wife stopped asking him for money to buy new clothes, yet every other week, she came home with new clothes, new shoes, new earrings.

Their kids stopped going to public school. This year, they started going to that fancy private school with a very good reputation.

The new car, yeah that's right, his wife got a new car. He always thought it was a little weird, given that he doesn't get a raise in nearly 5 years, he can barely save money for himself, and his income is supposed to be higher than hers, but he never really gave it any thought.

Now that he thinks about it, despite his shit income, he's been eating like a king these past few months. There has always been food at the table, good food, steak every week, quality wine every so often, the fridge is full, he's been eating pretty much what he wants when he wants.

Bills? He now remembers that he's not been seeing them for a while. For some reason, the bills stopped being a problem, and now that he thinks about it, he never got to question why.

Life has been very good.

&amp;nbsp;

He looks at his wife again, she's having sex with that stranger, a man he's never seen before in his life, shamelessly using his wife like she belongs to him, in that same bed he sleeps in.

Feelings of rage and disgust cloud his brain, he has the finger on the trigger, he's ready to shoot. But he starts thinking again.

&amp;nbsp;

The truth was that his wife was a bomb. She's well in her forties, yet her beauty remains the same as when she was young, that woman seems imune to aging, even after giving birth to 2 kids. She had a good pair of tits, a round delicious booty, and sex with her was simply amazing.

Hell, seeing her in action right now was just reinforcing the idea of how perfect she was in bed.

&amp;nbsp;

He stood there silent for one more minute, pointing his pistol at his wife and her lover, while reflecting on those thoughts.

Then, he silently puts his pistol back in its place, and slowly leaves the room, still careful so he doesn't get noticed.

He says to himself:

-The motherfucker pays for my wife's clothes, buys her a new car, pays for the kids private school, pays for the food so I get to eat like a king for free, and he even pays all our bills. Yet, at the end of the day, I still get to have passionate sex with my hot wife when I get home every day...

&amp;nbsp;

He closes the door behind him, and laughing, reaches the conclusion:

-Well, fuck it... He's the cuckhold, not me!",Wise decision,7

Yes, it's bad.  Context: My wife and I took a summer long road trip across America, spending nights in motels and getting up early and driving far to our next destination for almost two full months so we could see as many of the sights as possible.

One morning, bright and early as we were somewhere in the Dakotas... I looked out over the horizon and saw some cows... I yawned loudly and mumbled ""more mooers"".  My wife misheard me and asked ""Lawn Mooers??""  

I chuckled, liking that more and we worked on the set up so we could tell our friends kids when we got back, since it's a good joke for kids.

Thanks.",What do you call a cow grazing on grass?,4

They dropped it from the highest cliffs, and crushed it in the deepest oceans.
They tried igniting in it the sunniest of locations, and in the darkest of crevasses.
They subject it to the hottest temperatures they could muster, both natural and manmade.
And yet, the material was unwavering, refusing to yield to any force…until a scientist suggested the impossible.
“What if it only explodes when it’s really cold?”
Out they set to test the theory. Sure enough, as the temperature grew ever colder, the element began to show signs of degradation. Excitedly, they began pushing the temperatures even further into the freezing zone. As the temperatures reached nearer and nearer to 0 Kelvin (absolute cold), the element continued to increasingly react.
Finally, when the temperature reached approximately that of absolute zero, there was a blinding flash as the element exploded before their eyes, leaving a gaping hole on the laboratory bench.
As the applause from the team of scientists began to die down, relieved of finally solving the mystery, one of the senior scientists boldly asked, “so what do we name this newfound element?”.
Amongst the thought that ensued, one of the younger scientists was quick to make a suggestion...

My mum tells this joke and she swears it's the funniest joke ever. However the rest of the family don't get it. I feel like she has forgotten an element or something. Here is the joke.

2 troubled boys are told that they have to behave or santa won't bring them gifts. Their behaviour improves and their mum buys them presents. To avoid them finding them pre Christmas she finds them behind a wall mounted moose head. 

Come Christmas day, their mum forgets where she hid the gifts (or maybe she died, or was otherwise unable to give them the gifts). The boys decide behaving well isn't worth it and they turn to a life of crime.

Years later, in a police chase/ shootout situation, the two boys find themselves escaping into the family home. The house is shaken up by the entrance of the police, dislodging the moose head. Gifts come out.

The boys exclaim ""There's been a huge mistake!""

That's the end of the joke. My mum CACKLED when she tried to retell it. But so far as I can tell it isn't funny. Does anybody know this joke? Are we missing something? Is my mum just Norm MacDonald?","Need help finishing a joke - Moosehead Christmas Presents ""There's been a huge mistake.""",1

post,e4e1mw,2qh72,jokes,false,1575188925,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/e4e1mw/why_monks_exist/,self.jokes,,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.  


Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there.  


One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.  


The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.  


He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.  


""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


""Well, then can I become a monk?""  


""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""  


So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.""  


So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.  


""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.  


The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""  


""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""  


Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end.  


Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!  


Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""  


""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""  


The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.  


Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor.  


The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.  


Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!  


Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!  
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""  


""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""  


The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.  


Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.  


Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.  


Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.  


Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.  


Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!
