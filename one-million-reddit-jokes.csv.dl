She started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house, and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to do.

""Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint my porch,"" he said, ""How much will you charge me?""

Delighted, the girl quickly responded, ""How about $50?""

The man agreed and told her that the paint brushes and everything she would need was in the garage.

The man's wife, hearing the conversation said to her husband, ""Does she realize that our porch goes ALL the way around the house?""

He responded, ""That's a bit cynical, isn't it?""

The wife replied, ""You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes we've been getting by email lately.""

Later that day, the blonde teenager came to the door to collect her money.
""You're finished  already?"" the startled husband asked.

""Yes, she replied, and I even had paint left over, so I gave it two coats.""

The fields were full of hops, and the countryside was dotted with oasts, little round buildings for drying them out.

Now, as you know, Rumpelstiltskin would go on to be famous for his magical ability to turn straw into solid gold, but he first learnt his skill using the local hops. Every night he went out with his little scythe, reaped a few hops from the corner of a field, and turned them into gold back at home. He knew it was dishonest, but he took such tiny quantities that the farmers never noticed.

Over time, though, Rumpelstiltskin noticed his gold was fetching less money at the market. His steady supply had driven the price of gold down, and he was going to need more hops to make the same money.

So he cleared bigger and bigger areas each night, and before long the farmers noticed there was a hop thief about. Worse, it was taking Rumpelstiltskin the entire night to gather all the hops that he needed. Soon he wouldn't have enough hours of darkness to keep up.

Just as things were looking bleak for him, Rumpelstiltskin had a brilliant idea. The farmers and labourers were already doing the time-consuming work of harvesting the hops and piling them up inside the oasts. If he wanted to grab hops quickly, he just had to break into one of the oasts. Instead of reaping the fields...

""Reap oasts,"" he murmured. ""It might be stealing, but it's the quickest and easiest way to get gold.""","When Rumpelstiltskin was a young man, he lived in rural Kent.",412

post,ce4urg,2qh72,jokes,false,1563319829,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ce4urg/lpt_always_read_product_reviews_before_buying/,self.jokes,,"Like a lot of people, I’ve been drawn in by Amazon to check out their prime day deals. I was browsing through the electronics earlier, looking for a new flash drive for transferring documents between my home and work computers.  The primary one I use currently is only USB 2.0 and I figured it might be a good time to upgrade it. Came across what looked to be a really good deal on a 128GB SanDisk drive, and I was about to buy it when I looked at the reviews and saw how many 1 star ratings there were. That struck me as odd because usually SanDisk is a good company for that sort of thing.

So I dig in and start reading some of these reviews, and they’re horrible. Repeated issues of transferring files to the drive and being unable to find them afterward, or saving things one place and them showing up in a completely different folder later. One person spent hours writing a script in python and found it reformatted entirely elsewhere, forcing him to start over. It got so bad that another reviewer even posted a picture of his SanDisk drive run over with his car out of frustration. Review after review, people seeing red due to issues with their flash drives imprecisely saving data. Several people commented that they wished they had believed the reviews before buying, and that they were shocked by such a reputable company making such an unreliable product. Frankly, I’m as surprised as they are.

Nobody expects the SanDisk imprecision.",LPT: Always read product reviews before buying electronics,6

The first boy, Jonathan, takes a brick and throws it up in the air. The brick flies high towards the sky, and comes falling back to earth again where it lands with a soft splat about two inches deep in the soil.

The second boy, Frank, thinks he can do better than this. He takes a brick and hurls it in the air. The brick seems to fly even higher than Jonathan’s, and lands with a soft thud in the soil, three inches deep. 

Mark, The third boy, then takes a brick of his own, determined to throw it even higher than Jonathan and Frank. He gathers his full strength and throws the brick into the air with all his strength. The blick flies, high up into te sky, and...

He had a large pond in the back. It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some apple and peach trees.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't  been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket  to bring back some fruit. 

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing.

As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. 

One of the women shouted to him, 'we're not coming out until you leave!'

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't!

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.

With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus.

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""","In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus.

One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant.  Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he said he would pay her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child. Furthermore, if she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18.

She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discreet, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin. 

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. 
 
'Honey, she said, 'you received a very strange post card today.' 

'Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,' he said. The wife did and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted.

A couple days in, Bob and Harvey go out for coffee. As Harvey walks in the door, a man Bob has never seen before walks up to the two of them and says, ""Long time no see, Harvey! It's been at least thirty years since we saw each other"". Harvey and the man have a conversation for a while, and finally, after they are done, Bob asked who that was. Harvey responded, ""Oh, just a college friend"". As they walk up to the counter, the man behind the counter also recognizes him. After a similar conversation and three cups of coffee, Bob and Harvey leave.

Walking down the street, lots of people wave to Harvey, some walking over and saying hi. Bob finally had enough, and had to know how Harvey knew so many different, seemingly random people. Harvey simply said, ""I know everyone"". Bob laughed and said, ""You can't possibly know everyone. Name ten people who haven't waved or said hi yet"". And Harvey did. The ten people even turned around and waved to him. 

Bob still didn't believe him. ""I bet you don't know the mayor, or the police chief"". Later that day, while walking past the City Hall, the mayor and police chief were sitting on the steps sharing a box of donuts. Harvey waved to them and they called him over. There were a couple ""Hey Harveys"" and some more old memories remininced upon. 

Bob still didn't believe him. ""I will bet you $1,000 that you don't know the president. Harvey said, ""Okay"". Bob drove the two of them to Washington D.C.. After they got out and approached the White House, some of the security guards waved to Harvey and called out to him. As they kept walking, people moved out of the way for them, all of them knew Harvey. They passed through security gate after security gate, finally arriving at the Oval Office. Harvey was let right in, without an ID or security check, but Bob was checked a few times. As they walked in, Bob was face to face with the president. ""Hey Harvey, how've you been? Who is that with you?"" Bob was dumbstruck. ""Oh, that's Bob, a friend I used to work with"". The three talked for about an hour before Bob and Harvey left. 

Bob reasoned that Harvey might know everyone in the country. ""I will bet you one million dollars that you don't know the pope"". Harvey said, ""Okay"". That night they flew to the Vatican. Harvey was greeted by lots of people in many different languages as they walked through the airport. As they made their way towards the Apostolic Palace, Harvey was mobbed by massive throngs of tourists.  ""Could he really be this popular?"", Bob thought. Bob decided to wait out on the street and told Harvey walk out with the pope as he addressed the people. About a half hour later, Harvey appeared with the pope as he had promised to Bob. As Harvey waved out to the crowd, he spotted Bob, who had collapsed to the ground. Harvey ran down to him and shook him awake. He said, ""Bob, are you okay?"" Bob responded, ""I was doing fine until the guy next to me said 'Who's that guy up there with Harvey?'""","I haven't been on this sub long so I don't know if this is a repost, I heard it a really long time ago from someone",3

I'm Joe Buck and as always I'm joined by my friend and colleague Troy Aikman. We now go down the field to our sideline reporter Pam Oliver with an update on the injured Aaron Rodgers 

I just finished up talking to Head Coach Mike McCarthy and he said Aaron Rodgers will play dispite the rib injury he sustained last week at Indianapolis. So we'll see how that affects his performance this afternoon 

Troy, your thoughts? 

Yes, I think him playing is the key factor in this game, many people even myself have thought he wouldn't be playing today, and a rib injury will definitely slow down and affect his mobility in this game.

We now go down the field for the playing of our national anthem performed by John Legend

""Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.  Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, over the ramparts we watched, we're so gallantly streaming and the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

He was trying everything he could think of. “Thank the Lord,” “By the blood of Jesus,” “Amen” But the horse would not stop. The man then realized that the horse was running towards a cliff.

Barber: ""Mr President, certain pollsters are claiming that your approval ratings are dipping. How is the mid-term campaign going for the party?"". 

""That's fake news. Don't worry we'll win bigly. You'll see!"" Trump states unabashedly and goes into a verbal assault on the fake news media.

The haircut turns out well and everyone complements Trump so he decides to go to the same barber again.


This time the barber doesn't waste much time and goes straight to politics. 

Barber: ""Mr. President, I heard on CNN that things are starting to look really bad for you especially after some of the mid-term losses. You confident you'll still be able to keep the Democrats off in the next election?"". 

Irritated at this Trump bursts out ""It's the fake lying news media again. They say that all the time. I'm not worried and neither should you..."" and goes into some rambling about being the best President ever.


Again the haircut turns out really well so much so that Melania insists Donald keep the guy for this job so after some hesitation Donald pays him a third visit.


Just as he has Trump seated in the chair ready for the haircut, the barber goes ""Mr. President there is so much chatter about the FBI closing in on you for the Russian interference in election and with people calling you a racist bigot and demanding to impeach you, do you think you'll be alright in 2020?"". 

Immediately Trump goes berserk in anger ""That's it! I've had enough, you're fired!""

The barber somewhat apologetic pleads Trump to relax and reminds him ""I've done a good job previously, didn't you notice?""

Trump: ""Yes that is true but what does that have to do with all of this.""

Barber: ""Well that is because Mr. President every time I bring up the ""fake news"" your hair stands on edge""",Trump finds a new barber for getting a hairdo,1

However, all of a sudden, he spots something in the middle of the road. At first he says:

\-""Get the fuck out of the road you fuck!""

The cow gently raises her head and replies:

\-""Go around you cunt!""

The guy can't believe what he just witnessed, he's completly astonished as he slowly goes back into the car.

He sits, puts his hands on his head and, still thinking of what he's just seen, says:

I can help you - let’s play a little game. You each get one chance to name a task I can’t do. If you succeed, I’ll save you.”

The first man immediately replies, “I bet you can’t build a highway that goes around the entire world!”
The devil snaps his fingers, and instantly, a road appears that circles the globe. The first man expires on the spot from a mixture of thirst and despair.

The second man, looking at the corpse of his friend, thinks for a minute. He thinks of his job, his family, his friends, and the life he has to return to. 

After spending some time drawing figures in the sand and doing some calculations, he hesitantly says, “There’s no possible way you can build a ladder that reaches space.” But the devil simply smirks and taps his pitchfork on the ground, and at once, a ladder to the stars appears. The second man perishes where he stands, muttering the name of his wife and children until his last breath.

The third and final man calmly looks at the bodies of his companions and sits down in the sand to brainstorm. He thinks of the time his spouse first kissed him, the moment he first saw his son, and the last words of his late father telling him how proud he was of him. 

Having made up his mind, he quietly tells the devil, “First make a chair.” Puzzled, the devil creates a simple wooden chair. 

“Next, poke 20 holes in it about an inch in diameter.” The devil follows these instructions. The man suddenly pulls down his pants, sits on the chair, and passes a loud fart. 

As the devil looks on in amazement, the man stands up and asks “Which hole did I fart through?” 

So the devil points to the hole three rows down, in the second column. “That one.” And sure enough, it is.

But the man smiles and bends over, pointing to his rear, and replies, “Wrong - I farted through this hole.”","Three men are lost in the desert with no supplies, when the devil appears before them.",48

(That's ""massive"" in the sense that they are very large, although they are also particularly passionate about eating other humans.) They are immediately bound and carried back to a village – the explorers, I mean, not the cannibals – where they are presented to the chief.

""You are very fortunate!"" the chief bellows (in perfect English, somehow), ""for tonight, you will be given a choice! You may choose to be eaten in a grand feast... or you may marry my beautiful daughter, Bahuda!""

""Why can't Bahuda marry one of the other cannibals?"" the second of the three explorers whispers.

""Shut up,"" hisses the first. Then he clears his throat and addresses the chief. ""I will marry your daughter!""

A cheer goes up in the village, and every cannibal starts to chant ""Bahuda! Bahuda! Bahuda!"" From a nearby hut, a truly gargantuan woman emerges, her muscly arms as broad as some of the nearby tree trunks. The first explorer is intimidated by the sight of her, but he goes through with the ceremony, being wed to her on the spot. The other two explorers are allowed to stay alive for the evening, in honor of the happy occasion.

That night, as the village grows quiet, the sounds of screaming, bones cracking, and decidedly ominous squishing fill the air... and the next morning, the two unwed explorers are brought before the chief again.

""Alas,"" he says, ""my gorgeous daughter, Bahuda, was unexpectedly widowed during the night... so I shall present you with the same choice as before! You may choose to be eaten in a grand feast, or you may marry Bahuda!""

The second explorer raises his hand. ""Sorry,"" he says, ""but I'm still not clear on why Bahuda can't marry one of the other cannibals.""

""I heard 'Bahuda' and 'marry' in that sentence,"" replies the chief, ""so I'm going to assume that you intend to wed her.""

""Okay..."" the second explorer mutters.

""*Excellent!*"" the chief exclaims. ""You shall be wed immediately!""

As it had before, a cheer goes up in the village, and every cannibal starts to chant ""Bahuda! Bahuda! Bahuda!"" From within her hut, the imposing figure of Bahuda appears, her balled-up fists as large as a man's head. The second explorer swallows nervously, but he goes through with the ceremony, and his remaining friend is allowed to stay alive for another day, if only to provide an impromptu best man's speech.

That night, as the village once more grows quiet, the sounds of shrieks, limbs being snapped, and not-at-all-reassuring crunches echo beneath the stars... and the next morning, the third explorer is yet again brought before the chief.

""A grave misfortune has befallen this village,"" he says, ""and my impossibly alluring daughter, Bahuda, has experienced a second widowing... so I shall present you with the same decision as I did your friends! You may choose to be eaten in a grand feast, or you may marry Bahuda!"" He grins expectantly. ""I assume you will take the latter option.""

""Well, that's where you're wrong!"" the third explorer shouts back. ""Haven't you heard that one in three men is gay?""

The chief considers this. ""I mean, Bahuda is fairly manly.""

""I don't care,"" replies the third explorer. ""I will die with my dignity. I choose death!""

A murmur ripples through the village, and the chief looks stunned. ""Nobody... nobody has ever chosen death,"" he eventually answers. ""Still, if that is your wish, so be it."" Then he turns to face his tribe, raising his hands above his head. ""He has chosen death; death by Bahuda!""",The Terrible Legend of Bahuda,44

It all started on the first day of second grade. There was a young boy who was super excited to go back to school and see all of his friends from first grade again. In fact, He was so excited he had gotten up really early and packed his little backpack full of all his school supplies like pens and pencils, paper, coloring markers, and more. 

He got into the car with his mom and they drove to school where she dropped him off. He strode into class that morning smiling ear to ear because he knew today was going to be a wonderful day. That’s when it happened. In addition to seeing all of his old friends from last year, there was this one new girl. The boy, wanting to welcoming and friendly, decided to walk up to her and say something nice. He gets a bit tongue tied and blurts out, “Hey, I think you have a pretty dress.” At this point the girl’s jaw drops, she looks at him and then slaps him as hard as a second grader can. He goes to his seat ashamed and confused and sits down wondering why she would react so strongly to a simple awkward statement. 

Right before class starts, the teacher calls him up to her desk and asks, “what did you say to offend this young lady?” He responds with, “I don’t know, I just wanted to make her feel welcome, so I told her she had a pretty dress.” The teacher stares, stunned, at the little boy, then says, “How dare you say that to her! Go to the principle’s office right now!” The boy is shocked at the teacher’s reaction, but he obediently exits the classroom and starts walking down the hall towards the principle’s office. He opens the door and steps inside the office thinking that surely the principle will be more understanding of his predicament. The principle looks and the boy and says to him, “Now now son, what did you do to get sent here on the very first day of school?” The boy responds saying, “Well, there was a new girl in class, and I wanted to make her feel welcome, so I told her she had a pretty dress.” The principle stands up, towering over the young boy, slams both his fists into the desk, and ferociously screams, “How dare you say such a thing in my school! Go home now! I’m calling your parents to let them decide how to deal with you!”

The little boy walks out the principle’s office, and then out of the school, and began to slowly trod home wondering where everything went wrong. He is unable to come to any conclusions about his mistake, but he holds onto the hope that his parents will understand that he did nothing wrong. As he rounds the corner onto his street his heart sinks as he sees his mom waiting outside the front door with her arms crossed and that disappointed look on her face that only moms can do. He walks up to his house, and his mom simply says, “Go up to your room, we’ll discuss what happened when your father gets home from work.” The boy goes upstairs to his room and starts crying because he has no idea what he did wrong or why everyone is turning their back on him. Eventually he hears his dad’s car pull into the driveway, so he heads downstairs after wiping his tears away.

While the three of them are gathered around the dinner table, the father can tell there is some extreme tension in the air, so he breaks the awkward silence by asking what’s wrong. The mom nods at the boy and says, “Go on, tell your father what you’ve done.” The boy collects his thoughts and then explains, “Earlier today, I saw a new girl at school. I only wanted to make her feel welcome, so I went up to her and said, hey I think you have a pretty dress.” The dad slowly stands up, fuming, rage about to spill over, but he contains himself. He looks to his wife and says, “Honey, we need to discuss this in the other room.” The parents both leave and go into a separate room where the shut the door and start talking. In just a short while, the boy can here them yelling and screaming and furniture being thrown around. Eventually they both emerge. The dad slams the door behind himself and says to the young boy, “You aren’t my son anymore. You have five minutes, go pack a bag and get out of my house.” The boy stands aghast for moment, unmoving, until he realizes that they are both dead serious. He goes back up to his room where he throws a change of clothes, his markers, some goldfish, and his piggy bank into his school backpack, and proceeds to leave his house. That evening as he finds a bench to rest on, it hits him, he is homeless, with virtually no money, no plan, and no hope.

And so he remained homeless for many years, sometimes hungry, sometimes just barely scraping by, but always with the lingering question in the back of his mind as to how he could have ended up this way just by telling a girl she had a pretty dress. One day, while the boy was in his late teens, he was sitting on a bench at a bus stop, enjoying the sunny afternoon, and an elderly man sat down a few feet from him. The boy could tell that this man was also homeless based on his torn clothing, scraggly beard, and dirty face. Despite this, the man offered to buy the boy a sandwich. The boy said, “No thanks sir, I’m doing alright and you clearly need the money.” The man insisted though, “It’s no problem, the sandwich shop is just across the street.” The boy refused again, but still the man continued, “Seriously, you don’t look well off, and I want to do something nice for you.” Finally the boy conceded saying, “Fine, do what you must.” The man stood up and started across the street when…

\#SLAM!!!

The man is hit by a bus, smashed into the pavement, and instantly killed.

Moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing the street.",The girl in the pretty dress.,15
