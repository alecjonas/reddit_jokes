""Yes, but there better be one this time""

""This is the third day in a row I have been here and I have yet to receive a joke with my order, I wish to complain to a manager""

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife.",Socrates the philosopher . . .,65

He goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.

The bartender says, ""Sure, I'll take a bet. What's your action?""

The man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. The bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.

Laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. ""Double or nothin' says I can bite my other eye.""

The bartender thinks it over. He knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.

The man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.

Now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. Just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.

""Real sorry about that, pal. I get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so I'll give you another chance to win some cash. I've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, I can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. This is kinda hard for me to do, though, so I think it's fair if you give me two chances at it.""

The bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. Especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. After a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.

The man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, ""Go!"" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.

The man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. However, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.

Catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. Once again, he shouts, ""Go!"" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar.

Once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. However, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass.

Head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.

All of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams ""Fuck!"" at the top of his lungs.

The bartender mutters aloud, ""I wonder what his problem is.""

To which the man replies, ""Oh, I just bet that guy $10,000 that I could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy.""","A man walks into a bar, he goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.",1022

""Welcome to the Husband Store! There are 9 floors in all, but be warned: once you go past a floor, you're not allowed to go back down. You either make a purchase, or leave empty handed.""

The woman scoffs at the sign, and makes her way to the second floor. On the second floor, there are a selection of men in glass tubes, in stasis. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These are men. There's nothing special about them, but they are desperate for love.""

The woman browses momentarily, but is displeased and moves to the third floor. On the third floor, there are more men, locked away in tubes. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men have well-paying jobs.""

Looking around, she sees men dressed as doctors and bankers. She's still uninterested, and goes to the fourth floor. On this floor, there are even more men. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men have well-paying jobs and are good with kids.""

She looks, but isn't amused. She is getting a bit frustrated, but she makes her way to the fifth floor. On this floor, the men are noticeably more attractive. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men have well-paying jobs, are good with kids and are very handsome.""

Somewhat more interested, the woman looks around. She finds a nice looking man, dressed as a surgeon. As she's about to push the button to release him from his prison, she thinks to herself:

""Hmm, well, the men seem to get better with each floor, and I'm only on the fifth floor! I should keep going!""

And so, she did. She climbed the stairs to the sixth floor, with a room full of more men. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men are rich and retired, good with kids, and very handsome.""

The woman looks around, but some of the men are a bit older this time. Dissatisfied, she moves to the seventh floor. In this room with men, on a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men are rich and retired, young, good with kids, and very handsome.""

She looks around and finds a perfect man. He's in a black suit, and he's holding the keys to an expensive car in his right hand. As she's about to push the button to release him, she thinks to herself:

""Wow, he's perfect! But...there are still two more floors! Why not get an even better man?""

So, she left the man to stay frozen forever in time, and went to the eighth floor. In this room, the men were naked. On a podium, there is a sign that reads:

""These men are rich, young, hung like horses, good with children, romantic, and loving. They will cherish you forever, but you must make a choice soon...""

The woman looked and looked, and she found yet another perfect man. Perfect in every way, she almost pushed the button to free him, until she thought:

""Well, if these men are so perfect, the ninth floor men must be gods! I'll skip you.""

And so, the woman went to the ninth floor. This room was far different than the other rooms. It was empty, and as she stepped in, the door slammed and locked behind her. After that, another door on the right of her opened up with the words ""EXIT"" in red above it.

After staring in confusion for a few seconds, she heard a whirring sound. After a few seconds, she sees a figure in the distance of the far side of the room.

It was two podiums, one with more text, and another with a dildo laying atop of it.

On the podium, there is a sign that reads:

""Congratulations, you're ninth floor visitor 3,424,872,185. You've reached the top. In doing so, you have passed by over 100 men that we captured and locked away here. You could have freed one of them to live a happy life with, but instead, you proved that it is impossible to satisfy a woman. As consolation, here is a dildo to go fuck yourself with.

Now get out, and have a nice day.""","A woman is desperately looking for a husband, but she happens to stumble upon a stores that sells men.",31

Skip ahead to monday, the bros woke up late and hungover, and realizing they're late for their exam they rush to class.

When the professor asks them why they were late they tell him that their tire blew out on the way to class so they were delayed. Understanding, the professor tells the bros that he'll set them up for the exam the next day.

The bros show up the next day confident that they're gonna ace their exam, they studied all day and all night, there's no way they're going to fail! 

The professor takes the bros' phones and gives them their exams. Before letting them go, he tells the bros how the exam works. He tells them:


""There are two parts to the exam, the first part is multiple choice, there will be 100 questions""
 

The bros are a little taken aback, but understand, this is an exam after all.


""The second part is short answer, there will be one question, this is worth 90% of your mark""


This really knocked the bros off their feet, but overlooked it because it's an exam after all.
The professor sits the bros down in seperate rooms leaves them to do their exams. 

The bros are breezing through this exam, all thst studying really helped, but what would be the point of doing the multiple choice if it only couts for 10%? Curious, one of the bros flips through to the final page and reads the short answer.

He spends countless hours training under the best coaches in the country and wins several local and regional awards thanks to his tireless efforts. However, he was only the second choice for the main event in the upcoming Olympics, as he had one thing he wasn't that good at: landing. 

Despite countless hours practicing and trying out new solutions, he is unable to correct his wobble when he dismounts from the rings, pommel horses, or the parallel bars. He'd visited the best doctors in the country for their advice, trained under various specialist coaches, and subjected himself to countless fad diets in an effort to cure his affliction. 

Having resigned himself to his fate of being second-best, he simply chugs along, doing what he can to prove himself worthy. Just when he was about to lose hope, the number one gymnast suffers a nasty fall and breaks his ankle, just 6 months before the Olympics are due to start. Though devastated for his teammate, he is overjoyed at the prospect of representing his country and bringing back a medal. 

His coach, knowing about his issues with landing, tells him:

""Listen, the other countries are going to be sending only their best out to the Olympics, so we're going to have to find a way for you to fix your... little problem.""

""One of the very best gymnasts of all time - retired now - is out finding himself spiritually or something. I want you to go and find him, and get him to teach you how you can get yourself on the ground without looking like you're trying to balance yourself on a kayak! So go and get to it!"" 

And so the coach sends him out to look for a mentor who could possibly solve his problem. The man's head spins with anticipation: the gymnast he was going out to look for can only be described as a legend. He had won almost every international competition during his heyday and dominated the front page of magazines, newspapers, and blogs for the duration of his career! He was famous for his impressive physique, impeccable form and, most importantly, his rock-steady landings. 

After several days of research, the man goes to the mountains, where the retired gymnast is rumored to be trying to find peace with himself, and spends countless weeks searching high and low through the snow-capped peaks and fog-filled valleys. Time was beginning to run short as the Olympics drew closer, when he finally runs into an old man, with a grey beard and piercing blue eyes. What truly gives him away as the retired gymnast is his taut body and perfect balance as he balances atop a rock on one leg on the edge of a steep precipice. 

Not wanting to disturb the old man, the troubled gymnast watches in awe while the retired gymnast goes through his poses and motions. When the legendary gymnast is finally done, he approaches the fledgling Olympian and asks:

""It looks like you've come a long way to find me... What can I help you with?""

And so the young gymnast recounts his woes and his efforts at trying to resolve his problem. The old man, after some consideration, tells him:

""It is good that you have come. I have spent many years in these mountains trying to find peace, but since you are here, I may finally be able to absolve myself of my guilt and finally come to terms with my actions."" 

The young gymnast, despite being confused, listens earnestly.

""When I began my career, I had the exact same problem as you: I was completely unable to land without stumbling like a newborn calf. When I finally ran out of ideas, I resorted to something that will bring me endless shame... I cheated: I applied adhesive to the bottom of my feet so that when I landed, I would not move... It was the only way I was able to solve my problem, and the reason why my landings were the best in the world.""

""I am so sorry... Perhaps now I have shared this secret with someone, I will be able to forgive myself.""

The young gymnast could not believe it. His idol, a man he had admired for years: a cheat! 

Dejected, he travels to the Olympics and arrives just in time for the big event. Hurriedly changing, his thoughts dwell on the fraudulent gymnast's words. He spies a bottle of glue in a toolbox in the changing room, and quickly applies the glue to the soles. As he walks out into the bright lights lighting up the arena, he rationalizes to himself that if he didn't do this, all his efforts would have been in vain and he would never be allowed to compete again after making a fool of himself in front of the whole world. 

The gymnast mounts the pommel horse and begins his routine. It's breathtaking to watch: he twirls around effortlessly, making moves that the layman would barely be able to comprehend. He flips, he bends, he _flies_ through the motions as the end of his routine approaches...

The crowd waits with bated breath, wondering if this gymnast would be able to finish his routine flawlessly and time seems to stand still as he launched into the air, dismounting the pommel horse with a flourish...

...

**And he sticks the landing.**",A man's dream is to become an Olympic gymnast...,0

The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for.

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.'

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years.'

Joe tried the shirt and it fitted perfectly.

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?'

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..'

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36.

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..'

The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your Testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a Headache.'",Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years.,3631

The blue collared man is confused. 

""Sample a profession?  You mean I only have two days to try it out before I go back to my blue collar job?""

""YES""

So the man thinks for awhile about his options.  
""Actor maybe?....  Lawyer?.... President?...""

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",A handsome man went into a hotel,0

Ernie really wanted to ride the helicopter and so they went and upon getting there Ethel told Ernie he couldn’t go because the ride cost $50. Ernie pleaded with his wife and she kept refusing because, as Ethel would say, “$50 is $50!” 

The helicopter pilot having heard the whole thing and feeling sorry for Ernie approached the couple. He said “How about I make a deal with you folks? You can come up on the helicopter and if you can make it the whole ride without letting out a scream the ride is free. If either one of you let’s out a beep though, then you owe me the $50.”

Ernie was happy to accept and Ethel reluctantly agreed. So up they went and once they were up in the air the helicopter pilot started doing all kinds of tricks. Each one more dangerous than the last. To his amazement though, he didn’t hear a beep out of either Ernie or Ethel. Amazed he decided to land the helicopter. He landed and he got out and as he opened the door to let the couple out he started saying how he was amazed at how they kept their composure when he realized Ethel was no where to be seen!

He asked Ernie where Ethel was and Ernie told him she fell out the helicopter during one of his fancy tricks. The pilot asked “Oh my god why didn’t you tell me?” To which Ernie replied “well you told us neither one of us could make a beep and after all, $50 IS $50!”",$50,16

So they talked for hours, until they came to the subject of sex. The humans told the aliens how humans have sex and the aliens were in shock! It was very similar to the way the aliens did it. The men in the group decided to have a little experiment with switching wives for a night. When the human woman saw the alien man undress, she immediately laughed at his ""thing.""

The alien looked down and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot."" And he hit his head twice and ""it"" grew at least two feet.

The woman said ""Wow! That's impressive, but I could snap that thing if I wanted to.""

So the alien pulled his ears twice and it expanded. The two had the greatest sex of their lives.

The next morning the human man came for his wife and asked, ""How was it?""

The wife replied, ""Great!""

He tries to apologise, trying to come up with an excuse. The nun, seeing right through him  says : 'This is the right place. If you want to get fucked by the Sisters of Eternal Bliss, you have come to the right place'. The man walk in, a bit surprised and also a bit skeptical . As the nun leads him through an  extravagant corridor, she goes on to explain the working of the establishment. She shows him a door and explains  that each door leads to a room and another. 'Every room has a nun who will pleasure you in one way in increasing order of pleasure'. She warns him, however, that these services don't come cheap but he is free to stop after any room and leave if it was expensive or if he can't handle it. This was an unusual way to do things, the man thought, but out of sheer curiosity he decided to pay 5$ and entered the first room. 

As soon as he entered the first room, a nun waiting for him started to disrobe. She was the prettiest woman he had ever seen. But as he approached her, she stopped him. 'Only looking, if you want to more, you will have to the next room...that will be 50$'. That was asking a lot, the man thought, but if the next is even half as pretty as this nun, it would be worth it. He pays and enters the next room.

As soon as he entered the room, a nun waiting for him started to disrobe. To his amazement, she is even more stunning with a perfect body. He touches her and fondles her breast to his hearts content, but when he starts to undress, she stops him saying : 'Only touching, if you want to more, you will have to the next room...that will be 500$'. At this point, the man is all fired up and pays without hesitation.

As soon as he entered the room, a nun waiting for him started to disrobe. He couldn't believe that was possible, but the woman was even more beautiful than the previous. She  walks up to him, put her arms around his shoulder and give him the most sensual kiss he has ever had. She then tells him 'Only kissing, if you want to more, you will have to the next room...that will be 5000$'
 The man remembered the advice he got not too long ago. 5000$ was a lot, but his xperience so far was unlike anything he ever experienced. He pays and enters the third room.

He expected to see a nun, except to his utter dismay he was outside back on the street. Confused and bewildered he turns around to try and  renter, only to find a note stuck on the door :

After hours of arguing, they agree to go into the woods and convert a bear. They would meet up in next week to see who won.

The next week, the Priest comes in to the coffee shop with his arm in a sling and sees the minister drinking coffee with a cast on his leg. The minister sees him and asks if he converted his bear.

""Yes"" said the priest, ""though it was tough. I wrestled the bear for hours and that's how I got this, "" he points to the sling, ""but eventually, I pushed it into a river and baptized it, then it became docile as a lamb, its coming to Mass on Sunday.""

The Minister said ""I have a similar story, I found a bear eating a honeycomb, so I grabbed the honeycomb and ran to the nearest pond. The bear caught up to me and I had to wrestle him into the pond, not before he gave me this though,"" he pointed to his leg, ""anyway, once I got it into the water and baptized it, it became docile as a lamb. Its coming to Congregation this Sunday.""

Everyday he goes out  looking for work and everyday he comes back dejected. 

One morning—while flipping through the classifieds with his toes—he comes across the following ad, ""Wanted: bellringer for cathedral. Long hours, repetitive task. Strong and patient a plus. All welcome to apply."" After reading and rereading the ad he decides that he will apply.

The man gets to the cathedral and approaches the bishop regarding the position. ""I'm sorry, my child,"" says the bishop, ""but I do not see anyway you can perform this role."" The man tries to persuade him but continues to receive the same answer. Just as he was about to give up, light comes through the stained glass window and the image of the Holy Cross illuminates. The man says to the bishop, ""As a man of Christ, are you not supposed to give all God's children a chance?"" The bishop acquieces and agrees to give the man a trial.

The bishop and the man walk up the long, spiral staircase to the top of the belfry where a massive eight foot tall bell is situated. Once at the top the bishop says, ""The time is almost 1pm. If you can ring the bell on the dot then I will give you the job."" The man sizes up the bell, bends his knees toward the bell and sprints at it as fast as he can. He hits the bell as hard as he can with his head and a great cry rings out.

""Good,"" says the bishop, ""Continue to do this every hour on the hour until 8pm, and we will pay you each day at the end of your shift."" Excited, the man thanks the bishop and prepares for his new role.

The man sits and reads his newspaper. As 2pm approaches his watch alarm goes off and he lifts his ankle to look at it. ""Okay, time to prove myself,"" he says. He stands, sizes up the bell, bends his knees and sprints face first into the bell. The bell cries out.

As 3pm approaches the watch again goes off and he stands, sizes up the bell, bends his knees and sprints at the bell face first. The bell cries out.

4pm arrives and the man feels dazed but is determined and stands up. He sizes up the bell, bends his knees and sprints again into the bell. The bell cries out.

5pm approaches and the man's face is now swollen. He stands, sizes up the bell, bends his knees and runs at it. The bell cries out.

6pm has arrived and he can barely stand but he will not give up. The man stands, sizes up the bell, bends his knees, but feels wobbly, and runs into the bell. The bell cries out.

It is 7pm and the man only has one more hour to go. He is bleeding from cuts in his forehead and struggles to wipe away the blood dripping into his eyes. He is concussed and struggling to stand but he will not give up. He sizes up the bell, bends his knees and runs at the bell but not straight. He hits it this time on the side, loses his balance and falls out the window of the belfry.

The belfry is tall and he screams and screams as he falls to the crying of the bell. Eventually he hits the street below is killed by the impact.

A crowd surrounds the man as no one is sure what happened or who he is. An elderly woman approaches and bends down to touch his poor, beaten head. 

A man seeing this comes up behind her, rests his hand on her shoulder and asks, ""Do you know this man?"" ""No,"" says the woman, ""but his face rings a bell.""

Not long after the appointment, the man was at work when sure enough he started getting some very sexy texts from his wife, explaining in detail all the dirty things she planned to do with him when he walked through the door.

He finished his work anxiously and rushed to his truck to start making his way home, when the doctor's advice suddenly popped into his head. 'Where am I going to do this??' he wondered to himself, his options growing more and more limited as he got closer to home..

'AHA!' he thought 'I know what I'll do! I'll just pull off on the side of the road and lay under my truck for a couple of minutes, finish the deed, and no one will be the wiser.'

Feeling rather clever he pulled over, climbed under his truck, unzipped his pants, and closed his eyes tightly, allowing tantalizing visions of his beautiful wife to consume his mind.

Not very long in to his fantasy, the man soon heard approaching footsteps. Closing his eyes tighter to maintain his focus, he listened as a voice called out to him - ""Uh, sir, is everything alright?""

""Oh yes everything is fine, I'm just down here checking to see if I'm leaking any fluids, but thank you anyway for stopping"" he replied.

""Oh.. Well you might want to check the brakes while you're at it 'cause your truck rolled down the hill a couple of minutes ago.""

His bookkeeper is deaf and mute, that was the reason he got the job in the first place. It was assumed that Enzo would hear nothing that he might have to testify about in court.
When the Godfather goes to confront Enzo about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the 10 million bucks is that he embezzled from me.""

The lawyer, using sign language, asks Enzo where the money is.

Enzo signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you are talking about.""

The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Enzo's temple and says, ""Ask him again!""

The lawyer signs to Enzo, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him.""

Enzo signs back, ""OK. You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my cousin Bruno's backyard in Woodbridge !""

The Godfather asks the lawyer, ""What did he say?""

They are canned peaches and part of the appeal is you don’t have to pit them. They are pitted by other people before they get out in the cans! Easy! So he has this idea to hire a model to photograph in the process of pitting to communicate this idea to the consumer in a visual way. He sees a girl at a mall who is cute and asks her if she’s ever modeled before. The girl becomes shy and demure and tells him, no. He says, “I think you’ll be great for my ad campaign and label. Please would you pit this peach for me?” She finds it odd that a man brings peaches with him to a mall but she agrees to pit the peach. The guy is stunned, it’s the most beautiful image he’s ever seen, perfect, girl next door looks, pitting a peach! She’s sure to look even better with lights and makeup so he tells her to come to a photo session in a studio. She warns him that she is too shy and couldn’t be a model but he insists. A few days later at the photo shoot, she is dolled up and has peaches to pit in a rustic kitchen environment set that has been made just for this scene. There are several photographers and lights and everybody is waiting but she gets stage fright. In front of everyone she finds she cannot go through with the process of pitting the peach. She stands there, frozen in inaction, cursing herself for saying yes. After growing increasingly frustrated, the man shouts at her eventually, “I’m going to need you to pit, or get off the shot!”",An ad campaign for pitted peaches (long),10

""It's my salary you're living on, I do not want to do the dishes,"" says the father in the family.

""I did it last monday,"" said the girl.

It's quiet in the kitchen for a while, until mom gets an idea: ""I know how we'll do. The first one to talk does the dishes""

A quarter passes in absolute silence before hearing the daughter's boyfriend arrive on his bicycle. He has an old bike that makes a  squeaking noise every time he hits the pedal. When he arrives, he parks his bike and walks in.

""Good evening!"" The boyfriend's greetings are met with total silence. A little surprised, he sits next to the girl at the table. The father goes out to the kitchen, fetches the soup and serves it under silence.

""Great soup."" Says the boyfriend. No answer.

Whatever he says during the meal there is no one who answers. At this point, the boyfriend begins to panic and decides to do something drastically to get the family's attention. ""Oops!"" He says loudly and puts his hand on the girl's thighs. No reaction.

He touches her breasts. Still no reaction.

This is insane. ""What should I do?"" Thought the boyfriend. He then decides to have sex with his girlfriend in front of her parents. He bends her over the table and lifts her skirt up and starts having sex.

When he is done, the girl sits down quietly and continues to eat without saying a word.

""I can't believe this. You are a bunch of fools! At least say that I have to marry her!"" Screams the boyfriend desperately. He storms out of the house and walks away. While his bike still makes that awful squeaking sound.

""This is crazy!"" He says to himself.

Couic, couic.

""I had sex with their daughter on the table and they said nothing!""

Couic, couic.

""I probably could've had sex with the mother too, they would not have said anything either!""

Couic, couic.

He turns around and walks back. He opens the door, walks up to the mother, bends her over the table, lifts her dress up and has sex with her. When he's finished, he's thanking and leaving. Still met by a wall of silence.
