Eventually, I asked her if she wanted to drive since I may be under the influence of alcohol.

She replied with a stern, quiet, ""No.""

A bit odd, I just told her I'm drunk, and she isn't taking the opportunity to drive.

After a while, I asked again.

She replied with another stern but quiet, ""Rosa does not drive, Rosa only drives at the end"".

So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore.

""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here.""

And the gorilla says, ""At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised.""

The doctor told him, ""Olaf, I'll have to put your willy in a splint to let it heal and keep it straight. It should be okay next week, but leave it on dere as long as you can.""

He took four tongue depressors and formed a neat little 4 sided splint and taped it all together...quite an impressive work of art.

Olaf mentioned none of this to Lena, married her and they went on their honeymoon on the Gold Coast.

That night, in the Fifth Avenue Motel, Lena ripped open her blouse to reveal her beautiful, untouched breasts.

She said, ""Olaf...you're the first vun! No vun has EVER seen deez.""

Olaf immediately dropped his pants and replied, ""Look at dis Lena ... Still in DA CRATE!""","Olaf Swenson, out in his pasture in northern Queensland, took a lightning-quick kick from a cow...right in his crotch. Writhing in agony, he fell to the ground.

""It really tastes like shit. It is shit""

The second one, after tasting it again, replies:

""No, it doesn't taste like shit. It isn't shit""

Eyes puffy from hours of crying and yet tears still streamed down my face.  A lone snot bubble formed as I wiped my nose on my sleeve.  I refused to use my hands.  I looked down and in the pale moonlight streaming through the window I could tell they were still stained with gore.  I did my best to stop the shaking as my anxiety threatened to overwhelm me once more.  I heard muffled footsteps above me and my heart quickened threatening to leave my chest.  A sound at the basement door caused me to jump.  I trained my eyes on the door struggling to see in the dim light.  The door handle rattled and I held my breath.  So soon? I thought.  The door crept inward as someone on the other side pushed.  A tall figure stood silhouetted against the light from the kitchen.  I began to cry loudly.  Begging and pleading.  The figure deliberately took the steps slow.  Almost as though he was counting them. Every second a minute.  Every minute an eternity.  He stopped at the base of the steps and sensing me shift against the wall said ""You know... I didn't think you were capable... But you did it.  Good job.""  I sobbed harder than ever.  A thud next to me almost caused me to faint as my skeleton nearly left my flesh behind.  As he turned to leave he called out ""I hope it was worth it...""  I looked to my side and reached out for the object.  Finally...  I laughed a little.  Feeling slightly unhinged I laughed a little louder.  I fell into a fit of hysterics.  Cupping the cool object to my chest.  I knew it was worth it.  I looked at the wrapper one more time to ensure insanity hadn't finally overtaken me.  Klondike Bar.  I mean...

He learned how to fence at a young age and honed his skills over time, his prowess with the foil unmatched in all of France. After defeating all French contenders, he moved on to defeat fencers in nearby countries, eventually becoming the best in Europe. As his ego grew, so did his desire to put on a show. He staged fencing events in different environments; from sword fights in the Himalayas to duels in shark tanks, he won match after match. 

One day, he decided to host a fencing match in a submarine, which would be broadcasted to millions of viewers. When the day arrived, he was confident in his ability, but his opponent was relentless. Rather than being a pushover like the previous contenders, the match consisted of back-and-forth thrusts and lunges, with both participants straining to concentrate under the din of clashing metal. Eventually, both participants reached a tie of 14 points, meaning whoever received the next point would be the winner. The French fencer went for a feint, but his opponent was not fooled. It was quickly parried and his opponent sent a blinding return thrust into his sensor, earning the last point.
The French fencer was devastated. After so many years of training and so many years of being undefeated, his reign was over. 

He turned to confide in the captain of the ship. What could’ve been the reason? Was it the pressure from so many viewers? Or was the water pressure from being deep-sea throwing off his game?

The captain looked at him and replied, “don’t stress about it son. Ripostes are pretty common in this sub.”",The French fencer,481

&gt;Back in the 60's when I was in engineering school, I needed an easy filler class. I was already loaded down with calculus, physics, and engineering classes, so when I saw Ornithology, I decided to sign up. It only met 1 hour per week! The teacher was an old woman with gray hair and a nasally voice, who never took role or even remembered our names. Each class period we would go on a hike around the campus and she would point various bird species out to us. She never even gave any tests! When finals time came around, she hung various pictures of birds around the room and  asked us to identify them. There was a catch though: the only parts of the birds we could see were their feet. Now me being a good student I had studied for the test, but not the bird's feet. I walked up to the teacher and told her that I wasn't even going to take the test. She argued with me but I convinced her. She asked for my name so she could mark my grade as 0, and to this I removed my shoes and socks, placed a foot on her desk and said, ""You tell me!""

The bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It is shiny and in absolute mint condition. He immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years. ""Well, it's quite simple, really,"" says the seller, ""whenever the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain."" Saying so, he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I have to tell you something about my family before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.""

""No problem,"" he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation and leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word. So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her right there, in front of her parents. His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. ""She's got a great body,"" he thinks. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her in every position right there on the dinner table. Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain. Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, ""All right, that's enough, I'll do the fucking dishes.""",Joe wanted to buy a motorbike.,1606

Presentation day came and Alfred nervously presented the hammer to the smith. The classmates and the blacksmith were in awe of how good the hammer was.

In the greatest days of the British Empire, a new commanding officer was sent to a jungle outpost to relieve the retiring colonel. 

After welcoming his replacement and showing the courtesies (gin and tonic, cucumber sandwiches) that protocol decrees, the retiring colonel said, 

""You must meet Captain Smithers, my right-hand man, God, he's really the strength of this office.  His talent is simply boundless.""

Smithers was summoned and introduced to the new CO, who was surprised to meet a toothless, hairless, scabbed and pockmarked specimen of humanity, a particularly unattractive man less than three foot tall.

""Smithers, old man, tell your new CO about yourself.""

""Well, sir, I graduated with honours from Sandhurst, joined the regiment and won the Military Cross and Bar after three 

expeditions behind enemy lines. I've represented Great Britain in equestrian events and won a Silver Medal in the middleweight division of the Olympics. I have researched the history of...""

He was 30 years old and still lived at home with his mother. Johnny really was all about tractors.. in his room he had tractor posters, tractor toys, his bedsheets had tractors on them as did his curtains. You get the idea, Johnny really really loves tractors.

Anyway, one day his mother comes in and asks him to go down to the bar tonight and find himself a girlfriend. Johnny says "" I don't want to, there's no tractors there."" So his mother says she'll give him 50 bucks if he goes, so he agrees!

Off he goes then down to the bar and meets a lovely woman, he asks her ""Do you like tractors??"" To which she replies "" No I don't like tractors don't be so stupid"". Now, Johnny is furious! Storms home, and when his mother asks him the next day how he did he says ""It was terrible, she didn't like tractors!"". So his mother says ""Okay Johnny this time go down and don't say anything about tractors, I'll even give you another 50 bucks."" He wasn't sure at first, but then agrees to go down again tonight.

So there he is talking to a woman he seems to be getting on well with, and she tells him she's a taxi driver! So Johnny asks ""Do you drive tractors??"" And she says ""No why would I drive tractors don't be ridiculous, tractors are stupid."" 
Now, this didn't go down well with Johnny at all! He storms out the door and goes straight home into his room, tears all the tractor posters off the wall, burns all the toys and DVDs about tractors, destroys anything to do with tractors! The next morning his mother asks how he got on, Johnny says ""Terrible! I hate tractors now, I never want anything to do with tractors ever again. I absolutely hate them!"" So his mother says "" Why don't you go down to the bar again tonight, I'll give you another 50 bucks and this time you'll have no problems because you don't like tractors anymore so you won't talk about them!"" Johnny sees no reason not to so he agrees.

He walks into the bar that night, and after a few beers heads for the smoking room. In the smoking area he sees this beautiful woman! He thinks to himself ""my god that's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!"". But the woman can't breathe, she's coughing on all the smoke in the smoking room, it's burning her eyes and she's miserable. So Johnny walks up beside her, takes one huge deep breathe and breathes in all the smoke in the whole smoking area, suddenly everyone is looking at him in amazement. The woman stares at him and asks ""How did you do that!?"", To which he replies..

He gives the young boy 3 nickels to play with to keep him occupied.  Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face.  The father realizes the boy has swallowed the nickels and starts slapping him on the back. The boy coughs up 2 of the nickels, but keeps choking. Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help. 

A well dressed, attractive, and serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.  At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, neatly folds the newspaper and places it on the counter, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.   

After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last nickel, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.   

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman hands the nickel to the father and walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word.   

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, ""I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was
fantastic.  Are you a doctor? ""   

No, the woman replied. I'm with the I.R.S",The last nickel,174

The bartender was an old friend of John, and basically let anything go that he wanted to do, knowing he brought in most of his business just by being there because John had quite the following at the bar, with people egging him, pressuring him to do the things he said.

 One night, all of John's cronies were there, waiting for him to start ranting. Not long after he started drinking, he stood up and yelled, ""I bet I could down this entire bottle of whiskey!"", grabbing one from off the counter. 

One of his cronies stood up and shouted, ""Yeah! Yeah! You got this!"" while everyone else cheered. John grinned and downed the whole bottle in 10 seconds before smashing the bottle over his head. Everyone started cheering and yelling.

Some time passed, and John became more drunk and even more animated. He looked around and saw that a very large man had entered the bar and was ordering at the other side of the counter. Johns eyes lit up and he yelled, ""I could beat the shit out of that dude!"" The guy appeared not to notice, but one of his cronies called out, ""Yeah! Yeah! Kick his ass!"". So John stood up and walked over to the guy. When he still didn't look up, John picked up a chair, and smashed the guy over the head with it. The man fell to the ground unconscious but John's band loved it, and cheered him on. 

Even later on in the night, John was even more wild. He jumped up on the counter, grabbed a shard of glass from the whiskey bottle he had smashed and screamed, I'm gonna castrate myself, right here!!"" Again, one of his cronies piped up and yelled, ""Yeah! Yeah! You won't, no balls!""

Prickly Bob, not wanting a murder warrant on his head, has decided to let the desert take care of his latest problem with the law.

Now, I won't lie to you. Alone and buried up to his chin in red desert sand, things have never looked worse for ole Dan. But ever the optimist, Dan lets out a single, desperate, mighty whistle. After an hour of blinding mid-morning sun, up trots Skeeter, Dan's faithful bay gelding.

""C'mere, boy. Get close, ain't got the strength but to whisper,"" he gasps.

The horse steps forward and looks down at Dan. Dan whispers out, as quietly as the breeze, and off like a shot gallops Skeeter.

10, 15, then 20 minutes pass and Dan's beginning to worry. Much more time and that noonday sun's fixin' to plumb croak our hero in 30 seconds flat. Dan starts to say his prayers, when along comes Skeeter, carrying a buxom young brunette.

Keep in mind Dan's not too quick to lose his temper, so he kind of gradual-like pastes a frown on his sunburnt face and beckons the horse even closer this time. Skeeter leans down until his brown snout is almost touching Dan's forehead. Dan whispers out and Skeeter again gallops off toward town.

It's a heck of a tight spot, but Dan's feeling a little comfort from the shade of a spindly saguaro off on top of some nearby bluff. Thirty minutes pass, when up comes Skeeter, carrying a gorgeous redhead and a positively stunning blonde, the likes of which Dan's never seen in his life.

Dan can't mask his rage this time, but somehow coaxes Skeeter to come even closer. The horse half-kneels and puts his right ear up against the Deputy's cracked lips. Angrily, Dan gathers his strength and whispers with all his breath: ""No, Skeeter! P...O...S...S...E! Bring me a POSSE, you dang fool horse!""

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay.""

She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

""I'll bet he's an accountant."" said the first builder.

""Looks more like a stockbroker to me."" argued the second. They continued to debate the subject for a good while until eventually the first builder needed to use the toilet. On walking in, he saw the smartly dressed man standing at a urinal.

""Excuse me mate, but me and my friend have been arguing over what a smartly dressed fella like you does for a living?"" the builder said to the man.

Smiling the man replied, ""I'm a logical scientist.""

""A what?"" asked the builder.

""Let me explain"" the man continued, ""Do you have a goldfish at home?""

A bit puzzled, but intrigued the builder decided to play along, ""Yes, I do as it happens.""

""Well then it's logical to assume that you either keep it in a bowl or a pond. Which is it?""

""A pond"" the builder replied.

""Well then it's logical to assume that you have a large garden."" The builder nodded his agreement. So the man continued, ""which means it's logical to assume you have a large house.""

""I have a 6 bedroom house that I built myself."" the builder said proudly.

""Given that you have such a large house, it's logical to assume that you are married...""

The builder nodded again, ""Yes, I'm married and we have three children.""

""Then it's logical to assume that you have a healthy sex life.""

""Five nights a week!"" the builder boasted.

The man smiled a little, ""Therefore it's logical to assume you don't masturbate often.""

""Never!"" the builder exclaimed.

""Well there you have it"" the man explained, ""That's logical science at work. From finding out that you have a goldfish, I've discovered the size of your garden, all about your house, your family and your sex life!""

The builder left, very impressed by the man's talents. On returning to the bar the other builder asked, ""I see that smart bloke was in there, did you find out what he does?""

""Yeah,"" replied the first, ""He's a logical scientist.""

""A what?"" the puzzled second builder asked.

""Let me explain"" the first builder continued, ""Do you have a goldfish at home?""

“Well, then, let me have some,” says the golfer.

“As much as you like,” says the leprechaun. “But I must warn you, there is one serious side effect. It will almost certainly diminish your sexual desire.”

“I can live with that,” says the golfer, and gulps down a cup.

The brew works. Just as the leprechaun predicted, the golfer defeats all challengers and within six months he’s the undisputed local champion.

The golfer is delighted, and one day he goes back into the woods to thank his benefactor.

“It worked,” says the golfer. “It really worked! I’m the best golfer this club has ever seen.”

“Yes, but how about your sex life?” asks the leprechaun.

“Pretty good,” says the golfer. “I’ve had sex three or four times in the past six months.”

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

I wouldn't want to arrive as a guest and then need to leave for an hour or so to purchase gifts.  I would also want to see that they were wrapped.  Asking your host for wrapping paper to wrap their gift is poor etiquette.  And so I ventured out upon some Christmas shopping.

I hadn't got very far before I found a promising opportunity.  To be precise, I had gotten as far as my own doorstep, when I saw my neighbor across the street, adorning his house with some large letters.  I saw an 'O', an 'E' and an 'N'. Filling in the blank, I naturally assumed he was placing an ""OPEN"" sign upon the house, thus declaring his wonderful shop ready for the day's business.

Why would I assume he was selling from his own house?  I happen to know that my neighbor has certain affiliations with a group that is always looking to move some merchandise.  We'll call them the mafia.  I might have had some scruples about the business at first, but I like a good bargain and I also like to support local business.  Across the street is about as local as you can get.  So I proceeded across the street to initiate conversation.

""Good morning, Gary!""

Now, I was taking some liberty in using such familiarities, but I wasn't about to call him Gawrence.  As sturdy and well built as he might be, I didn't think he was prepared for the ponderous monstrosity which was Gawrence.  So I used the nickname Gary, which was a shortened form of his name.  Actually, it was a shortened form of his usual nickname, ""Gary the garroter"", but I've never felt comfortable addressing him as such.  I also prefer to stand facing Gary to give him less chance to misinterpret my intentions.  It doesn't always work.

""Hey, Gary, would you have any suggestion for some stocking stuffers?"", I asked.

He replied, ""It's not really my style, but I'm sure a door knob would probably work.""",Last minute Christmas shopping (anecdotal drivel),0

His comedy act was moving from clubs to theaters and his shows were being sold out months in advance. To top it off, he and his wife – who most of his jokes were about, were expecting their first born son.     

On the day of his birth, Jon took out a full page ad in the local newspaper to spread the news. The next day he got up early, expecting a long day of congratulations from his family, friends and fans. Hours stretched on without a peep. He waited and waited until the early hours of the evening before the phone finally rang.    

“Hey, Jon, it’s Jack.” Jack was Jon’s agent. “I’m sorry to say, your shows cancelled.”    

“That’s okay,” he replied. Jon was bummed of course, but it wasn’t all bad. It meant he was going to be focus on his wife and new child for a little while. “Which one got cancelled?”    

“All of them.”    

“What? What do you mean all of them?”    

“Look, Jon. You’re a good guy, I wish you all the best, but I’m a busy man. I can’t be representing someone I can’t sell.”    

Jon hung up the phone.    

His confusion faded to anger. His anger faded to determination. He was going to do something about this. They couldn’t ostracize him for being a father. They couldn’t just forget about him. He wasn’t about to let them. Taking out a note pad and a pen Jon wrote an open letter to all the haters, signed, sealed and mailed it to the very same paper.     

The next morning Jon got up early once again. He picked up his paper and rifled through it furiously tossing out the business section, global affairs, sports, the comics, finally finding his letter in the opinion section.    

He smiled as he read it, knowing he said all he needed to. All any father needed to say.     

It read: C    ",[LONG] Jon was on top of the world.,0

Mike texts back 'why don't you get a moose and teach it how to play checkers.  They would love that... nobody has done anything like that before.'

Bob initially thinks it's the dumbest thing he's ever heard of, but he considers it more and more over the next week, and gets obsessed with the idea. He starts to think it could actually work, and it's probably his best chance at getting on the show.  He takes his life savings out of the bank, drains his retirement and his kids' college funds, and finds a moose rancher on Craigslist.  A couple of days later the rancher drives up with a trailer and drops the moose off at Bob's house.

Bob decides the moose needs to get comfortable being indoors, so he slowly leads it into the house.  Bob's wife is furious, his children are terrified, but he's convinced it's the right approach.  He carefully places a checkerboard in front of the moose on the kitchen table but the red squares startle the moose and it flies into a rage.  It flips the table with its giant antlers and goes on a rampage, breaking windows, tearing out walls, and kicks Bob in the head knocking him unconscious.

Bob wakes up a half an hour later, and sees that his family has been gored and trampled to death.  There's moose shit all over the floors, water is spraying from the kitchen faucet, and the back door has been kicked open and the moose is nowhere in sight.

Just then his phone chimes, and he slowly pulls it out of his pocket and reads the text from Mike asking if he's given any more thought to that mouse act. ",Moose act,2

The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people.

The soldier didn""t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

Please be advised that all employees planning to dash through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh, going over the fields and laughing all the way are required to undergo a Risk Assessment addressing the safety of open sleighs. This assessment must also consider whether it is appropriate to use only one horse for such a venture, particularly where there are multiple passengers. Please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered. To avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance.


Benches, stools and orthopaedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks at night.


While provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by CCTV cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks. The angel of the Lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around s/he must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment to account for the harmful effects of UVA, UVB and the overwhelming effects of Glory.


Following last year’s well publicised case, everyone is advised that EC legislation prohibits any comment about the redness of any part of Mr. R. Reindeer. Further to this, exclusion of Mr. R Reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of this offence.


While it is acknowledged that gift-bearing is commonly practised in various parts of the world, everyone is reminded that the bearing of gifts is subject to Hospitality Guidelines and all gifts must be registered. This applies regardless of the individual, even royal personages. It is particularly noted that direct gifts of currency or gold are specifically precluded under provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, caution is advised regarding other common gifts, such as aromatic resins that may initiate allergic reactions.


Finally, in the recent case of the infant found tucked up in a manger without any crib for a bed, Social Services have been advised and will be arriving shortly.

Compliance of these guidelines is advised in order for you to fully participate with the festive spirit.",Be forewarned,1
