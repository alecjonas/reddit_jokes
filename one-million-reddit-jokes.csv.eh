post,bsvote,2qh72,jokes,false,1558797832,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bsvote/josé_the_great_mexican_magician/,self.jokes,,"A young man named José from a small town in Mexico had been learning magic for several years, and showed promise very early on, exceeding his teacher's abilities within only a few months. Over an amazingly short period of time, he became known as the Mexican equivalent of Houdini, although he didn't generally do many escape artist acts.

His magic was primarily sleight of hand and performing stunts which would always get great gasps out of his audience. Yet escaping dangerous situations seemed to be something he was never interested in. He enjoyed working with his assistants to make the impossible seem possible, but rarely did himself what he was practicing on his assistants.

Truth be told, although he was possibly the best ever to perform the specific magic he did, it was really his charisma that propelled him forward.

He travelled around Mexico performing, gathering crowds of dozens at first, then hundreds, and eventually thousands in one of the grandest stadiums in all of Mexico, Estadio Azteca, home of the national football team.

He stayed humble and came to realize that he loved performing in Mexico so much, that this was his country and his people. He decided there was no way, absolutely no way he'd ever leave to perform anywhere else.

At one point, as unbelievable as this is, he even managed to form such a large following that for his second appearance in Estadio Azteca, he was accidentally booked on the same day as a game between Mexico and the United States, which is a fairly important game as the rivalry between the two teams draws thousands of spectators.

Now, there's no question that football is more popular than a magician, even one as great as José el magnífico, yet many of his most ardent supporters petitioned to have the game cancelled in order for him to perform instead.

He wanted to perform, but he didn't want to cause so much trouble. And he certainly didn't want to have such an important game cancelled. He was ready to announce that he would cancel his show, and perform at a smaller venue. When he did, his supporters said ""no way"" and continued to petition the government.

This eventually led all the way to people within the government itself choosing sides, causing some political strife. At this point, José had no words. How could his simple act cause such division? This wasn't about José anymore, this had turned into something bigger.

The decision now lied with the government. And like most governments, this meant that by the time the game or performance came around, nothing would have been done. All that the members of the Congress did was shout over each other. Should the game continue? Again, his supporters within Congress shouted ""No way!"" Should he perform? His detractors shouted back ""No way!"" A bill was introduced, though the deadlock meant it wouldn't be voted on and enacted in time for date of the game.

His supporters decided to boycott the vote, regardless. They saw it as government overreach. This should be decided by the ruling football body. Why didn't they ask them in the first place? Finally, some sense entered into their minds. They haven't even consulted CONCACAF!

So the government left the decision to them and announced that CONCACAF's decision would be binding. Obviously, they weren't particularly impartial and the decision was made very quickly. The game was already set, the US had no idea who this magician was, and this had gone on long enough in Mexico. There was no way he'd perform.

While he still loved the people of Mexico, he began to feel dejected. The cost of division amongst his people was too much to bear.

His love for his country still shone through, but he was beginning to think that perhaps he should explore other countries.

It should be noted that while José was well-regarded in Mexico, due to him not performing or even caring about other countries, he was more or less unknown. He had a few followers who heard of his tricks and might have seen them when travelling to his home country, but it didn't even come close to the support he had in Mexico.

Due to this whole ordeal, he was lacking a bit of the charisma he was initially know for. Nevertheless, he travelled across South America, and gained a fair, but smaller following. No matter the size of the crowd, he always enjoyed performing and entertaining.

Due to his previous work, and the small but fair amount of money he received, he was able to travel and live comfortably if he ever decided to retire.

He spent several years performing everywhere from Buenos Aires to Bogatá to Rio, though never in such grand locations as he once did.

Losing some interest, he decided it was time to travel to the United States to perform. He reached the border, but something was wrong. He had his visa, but there had been a mix-up. He was told that he couldn't enter the country. There was absolutely no way.

He was utterly depressed. Why did he keep hearing those two words? It's always ""no way"". What is it that caused this constant rejection? Well, it doesn't matter because José decided he's had enough of this rejection. His passion and drive needed to return and nothing was going to stop him from performing in the US. He will go to Vegas and he will give the people the entertainment they deserve.

He did everything he could to make sure he'd be let into the US. And he was successful! He got a working visa and there were no mix-ups this time. He even had a small house rented near the Strip, and so worked his way through small clubs to slightly larger venues, gaining not only his charisma back, but many new fans as well.

On one night, he was booked to perform at Caesers Palace. This was it. The largest venue since Estadia Azteca. He decided that this time, he was going to try something different. Something he never did. His assistants would take a back seat tonight.

The show went smoothly and the audience was captivated. Not only was he performing fantastic tricks, but he was doing so without assistants! One of his tricks usually relied on his assistant, but he didn't have one this night, so he decided to do it himself, just as he had been all night.

""For my next trick,"" he said, ""I will make myself disappear! Yes, you heard that right, without any assistance, I will be gone. I won't hide, I won't pull any wool over your eyes. You will see me, and then you won't!""

The audience had heard this before. It's always the same, and it never truly looked believable. They said ""no way"". As he heard these words from his audience, he reminded himself of the performances he gave back in Mexico. Now was the time to go back to his roots.

To the audience he said, ""once I count to three, I will be gone! You will never forget this night!""

He started, paying great respect to his heritage, 

""Uno..."" 

""Dos...""

And he simply disappeared without a tres.","José, the great Mexican magician.",3

The problem is they don't know how to do it safely, so they decide to train a monkey to remove it.

A week later, the pig is much fatter and the monkey is reasy to remove the plug. One of the scientists is 10 meters away from the pig, other is 20 meters away and the last one is 50 meters away.

The little penguin waddles up to the mechanic and tell him about the issue.

So the little penguin then waddles over to the icecream store.

He takes a look around and just decides on the good ole classic vanilla.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Mark approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.

As carefully and as gently as he could, Mark worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Mark stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.

Mark never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Mark was walking through the New York Zoo with his teenage son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Mark and his son James were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Mark, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1994, Mark could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Mark summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder.

The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Mark's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

It probably wasn’t the same elephant.","In 1994, a zoologist named Mark Fisher was on holiday",22

Accompanied by his sweetheart's sister, he went to a department store and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping, the items got mixed up. The sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. 

Without checking the contents, he sealed the package and sent it to her with this note. Dearest Darling, This is a little gift to show my affection for you on our Anniversary. I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when you go out in the evenings. If it had not been for your younger sister, I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears the short ones that are easy to remove. 

These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me a pair that she had been wearing for three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had the sales girl try them on and she really looked great. I wish I could put them on you for the first time. 

No doubt other men's hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Be sure to keep them on when you clean them or they might shrink. I hope you will like them and wear them for me on Friday night. All my love, 

P.S. Just think of how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. Also, the latest style is to wear them folded down with the fur showing .",Glove and Panties,3

This woman kept on cheating on her husband. At some point, while fooling around in bed with her lover, she hears the key entering the front door lock!  


\-Oh God! she thinks. I need a real miracle. Please make my lover disappear before my husband enters the bedroom! You can ask for anything in return and I will do it.   


While she’s still making her mental plea, she hears God’s voice in her mind telling her:   


\-Child, I will grant you your wish. Keep in mind though, that you will have to pay a very high price for this... If I make this man disappear, in exactly three years from today, you will die!   


The woman gives it some thought:   


""And if you do not make him disappear, dear God, I will die in three minutes. In three years time, however, who knows what might happen...""   


…and she concludes: OK, I accept!   


KABOOM! Her lover disappears at once, before her husband enters the bedroom!   


Three years go by and her good husband makes a surprise gift to her, a cruise, for her and her girlfriends to go to the Bahamas!   


\- Here’s your ticket and enjoy yourself honey! Only women will be on the cruise-liner including all your girlfriends.   
You will have plenty of fun!   


On the day that the wife boards the cruise ship, it had been exactly three years since she had sealed her agreement with God....   
The cruise is well underway, and while they are in the middle of the Atlantic, a massive storm breaks out!   
Tall waves are slamming against the ship’s hull and at that precise moment she realizes that her moment has come...   


\- God, she says. I understand why I must die, after all that was our agreement. What about the other women onboard though?   


Almost instantly, a thunderous voice is heard:   


\- YOU BLOODY WH$R€S!!! IT TOOK ME THREE YEARS TO GET YOU ALL IN ONE SHIP!!!",Unfaithful Wife .,7

A few of my friends started listing off things they wanted to do like be a teacher or doctor or police officer. When it got to Stacey she said she wanted to be an actor because it had always been her dream since she was little. She was beautiful and very charismatic and i could definitely see her as a leading role in any movie or show. 

I started to tell everyone that i wanted to be a computer analyst and i already knew which school i was going to and about how i got a full ride scholarship to the university i wanted to go to. Before i could finish Richy chimed in and said that he wanted to direct films and that he knew the perfect role for Stacey. 

They started to talk directly and the rest of the group started to wander off and find other friends to hang out with until it was just me and them. The Richy said, “Why dont you go get us some drinks OP”.

A little frustrated and upset that my date was taking more of a liking to my friend than me I reluctantly left to go get drinks for us. 

As i was walking i started concocting all for these excuses for me and Stacey to leave Richy and dance or just leave the prom in general. But i decided that it was unfair to assume that anything bad would happen.

“But it’s so beautiful”, said the girl. “I really want it.”

The old woman became irritated. “I told you, it’s not for sale”, she said.

“Why not?”, persisted the girl.

“Because this doll is cursed!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Well… That’s OK. I don’t mind.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m not going to sell it to you… But if you really must have it, go ahead and take it. It’s yours. But if something bad happens, don’t blame me.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ah! Yes, thank you!” said the girl, smiling as she grabbed the doll and walked out of the shop.

The little girl was so delighted to get the doll for free that she ran all the way home, carrying it in her arms. When she got home to her apartment building, she went into the lobby. It was deserted. She stood there waiting for the elevator to arrive.

The doors opened and she stepped inside, clutching her new doll tightly.

The doors closed, but the elevator did not move.

The little girl got scared and began trembling with fear.

“OMG”, she thought to herself. “Is this the curse of the doll?”

Suddenly, she felt the doll move in her arms.

Ever so slowly, its head turned to face her.

The little girl wanted to scream but she couldn’t make a sound.

The doll’s eyelids fluttered and opened.

It stared at her with it’s lifeless glass eyes.

Then its mouth opened and it said, “Push the button to go up, bitch!”

He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence.

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.

The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""

The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in Australia and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in North Cowra. 

We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule'.""

The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?""

The farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up.""

The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees !

His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. 

The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie.

Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, ""Okay, you old fart. Now it's my turn.""

{ I love this part }...

The old farmer smiled and said,  ""Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.""

They were smoking for a moment when they started to feel rain drops, the 90 year old woman pulled out a condom cut off the end and put it on her cigarette and continued smoking it

The 80 year old had never seen a condom before so to her curiosity she asked her friend what it was, the 90 year old said ""this is a condom, I use it for smoking my cigarettes in the rain, you cut off the end and when it starts raining it keeps your cigarette dry so you don't waste it""

The 80 year old was impressed and asked where she could buy some condoms for herself, the 90 year old tells her that they sell them at any convenient store

The following morning the 80 year old goes to the nearest convenient store and walks up to the young cashier and asks the young man where the condoms were, noticing the womans age the young man reluctantly asks her ""Do you have any idea what kind of condoms you want?""

post,bsm1i6,2qh72,jokes,false,1558730792,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bsm1i6/the_knocking_noise/,self.jokes,,"A man was listening to sermon at a Synagogue and he thought it was the best sermon he had ever heard, but he had one complaint: throughout the entire sermon, the man had heard a strange, subtle knocking noise in the background. So he asks the Rabbi what the knocking noise was. The Rabbi replies, “I cannot tell you, for you are not a Rabbi.” So the man goes on his way. He keeps coming to this Synagogue to hear the amazing sermons of the Rabbi, but every time there is this knocking noise in the background. Eventually the man gets so fed up with it he decides to attempt to become a Rabbi.
 
Years later, after finally becoming an official Rabbi, the man comes back to the Synagogue and goes up to the Rabbi and tells him that he, himself is now a Rabbi and would like to know what the knocking noise is, as even now it is ever present. The Rabbi points to a nearby door and says, “Behind this door is a hallway, and at the end of this hallway you will find your answer.” And so the man goes to the door and finds it locked. He walks back to the Rabbi and tells him that the door is locked. So the Rabbi pulls out a key and gives the man the key. The man walks over to the door and unlocks it.
 
He looks down the hallway and sees that it is pure white, and it looks like it has no end. So he starts walking down the hallway. After a few hours with no tangible progress other than the fact that the door he entered keeps getting smaller he finds himself getting hungrier and hungrier, so he decides to walk back down the hallway to the Rabbi and asks the Rabbi if he has food. The Rabbi gives the man some food and some snacks for the hallway and the man journeys back into the hallway.
 
Finally the man sees what he believes is the end of the hallway: a door. So as he gets closer and closer to the door he hears the knocking noise getting louder. When he finally reaches the door he tries to open it and finds that it is locked. So he walks back down the hallway to the Rabbi. He tells the Rabbi about the door and the Rabbi gives him a key and some more snacks just in case he ran out. Then the man walks back to the door and unlocks the door and on the other side is a huge flight of stairs.
 
He looks down the flight of stairs and it is of the same pure, blinding white as the hallway, with the same endlessness. He starts his trek down the stairs. After about a day or so, he figures he’s about half way down the stairs. When he sees that his amount of food won’t last him, so he walks all the back up the stairs, down the hallway, and to the Rabbi. He tells the Rabbi about his situation and the Rabbi gives him more food and a backpack to carry it all in and the man walks back down the hallway to the stairs.

He makes it down the stairs a significant amount before he starts to see a door on a wall at the bottom of the stairs. He gets to the door and he tries to turn the knob and its locked. So he walks all the way back up the stairs and down the hallway back to the Rabbi and asks for the key with which the Rabbi complies. He then walks back down the hallway and down the staircase and reaches the door. He unlocks the door and he is amazed when on the other side of the door he finds a great open savannah. 

He does not know which way to start walking towards but he assumes that since he had been walking forward this entire time that he should still just do the same here and he starts walking. He walks for a few days, but finds that he will very quickly run out of food. Alas, the man walks back through the savannah, up the stairs, back down the hallway, and meets with the Rabbi. After hearing of the man’s plight the Rabbi gives him, an elephant and a lot of food and water, so that he may make his way through the savannah.

The man walks back down the hallway, and down the stairs, all the while his elephant significantly slowed him down, when he gets to the savannah. He walks through the entire savannah, when he sees something in the distance. After getting closer the man finds that what he saw was a door. He encroaches upon the door, trying to turn the knob finding it locked. So he walks through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. He asks the Rabbi for the key and the Rabbi hands him the key.  He walks down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, and to the door. Unlocking, and opening the door revealed a sprawling desert in front of the man.

On the fringe of the desert, the man leaves his elephant at the door between the savannah and the desert, deciding that taking the elephant would too quickly sap his water supply. So he grabs as much food and water as he can carry and goes on his way. The man however, does not make it far in his journey through the desert, using up the entirety of his water supply within a day. This forces the man to backtrack a decent portion of desert with no water. The man starts to become delirious and only finds his way back to the savannah, because of the elephant trumpeting. 

Drinking lots of water, the man walks back through the savannah, choosing to leave his elephant behind, so to not slow him down, up the stairs, and down the hallway. He speaks with the Rabbi about his water problems and so the Rabbi gives him a camel that he could ride on and use to carry his stuff. So the man walks back down the hallway, down the stairs, and through the savannah. At this point the man transfers as much supplies as he can from his elephant to his camel and begins on his way through the desert.

The man has a significantly easier journey through the desert and finally comes upon a door after a week or so of riding. The man walks up to the door however to find it locked. So the man walks all the way through the desert, across the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway and he asks the Rabbi for the key. The Rabbi obliges. So the man walks all the way down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, across the desert until he comes back to the door. He opens the door and pushes it open to reveal another sandy landscape. 

The air, however, felt different to the man. He figures that he is on the beach due to the sea breeze he was getting. So the man continues on with his trusty camel, all the way through the beach, until he eventually hits a large body of water. The man could hear the knocking noise getting louder yet, so he figured that it must be across the ocean in front of him. With no way to cross the water, the man walked back through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The man asks the Rabbi if he has something that can help, so the Rabbi gives the man a raft and paddle.

The man then walks down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach, where he took out his raft, moved his supplies from the camel, and went out on the ocean. The man was on the waters for about three days, when he saw land, however upon closer inspection he saw the camel he had left behind. He had ended right back to where he had started. He found this to be quite the issue, so he went to seek the Rabbi for assistance.

He walked through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The Rabbi, hearing the man’s plight, gave him a compass, to help traverse the waters. So the man walked back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach. The man repeating what he did with the raft earlier, got on and started heading in the direction the compass told him was in front of him: north.

The man had fallen asleep, taking a momentary rest, when he woke, startled, to the raft colliding with a door, just sitting on top the water. The man reached out for the knob to find it locked. So the man paddles back across the ocean, walks through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway, asking the Rabbi for a key. The Rabbi takes a while to find the key, but inevitably grants the man’s wish. So the man walks back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach, and paddles across the ocean. He reaches the door, unlocks it, pushing it open to reveal a jungle.

The man hops off his raft, and real quick ties it to a jungle tree, using a vine he had to fight with. The man begins, once again, his walk ever forward, fighting against the underbrush of the jungle. The man, with no real way to get water consistently, and getting hardly anywhere by fighting the plants of the jungle, decides, after about two days, that the Rabbi can help him. So the man goes back through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The Rabbi helps the man, giving him a spile, for water, and a machete for the brush.

The man goes down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach, and across the ocean, and into the jungle. With the machete, the man now makes tremendous progress in hardly any time, and after about a week of drinking from trees and eating plants, the man comes across a familiar sight of a locked door. So the man begins his journey back through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The Rabbi was already holding a key out to the man when he arrived.

So the man walks back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach, and across the ocean, through the jungle and unlocks and opens the door revealing a large, intimidating mountain. The man starts to scale it and, slowly, he made progress. However, the man quickly realised that he did not have any way to get his supplies up the mountain with him. He tried to make due with the fruit he took from the jungle, even drinking from a mountain stream, but he ran out of both the food and the stream within a week of climbing. So the man relented, going back down the mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway.

The man speaks his case to the Rabbi who gives him a mountain goat to carry supplies with. The man, goat in tow, walks back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, and across the beach, and across the ocean. Getting to the jungle the man gets as many supplies as he can on the goat and goes through the jungle, not using any goat supplies, but rather the spile and fruit. The man makes it to the mountain and begins scaling it with the assistance of the goat. After two weeks of just climbing the mountain the man finally comes across a door, at the summit of the mountain. The knocking is truly tangible now, and the man’s resolve is steeled, he reaches for the door to find it locked, once again.

The man proceeds to walk back down the mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The man asks for the key from the Rabbi and the Rabbi, grants the man the key. So the man walks down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, across the beach, across the ocean, through the jungle, and up the mountain, where he unlocks the door. Opening it reveals to the man, only a steeper mountain. The man feels cheated, with it not being a new, more colorful landscape, but he tries to goes on nonetheless. 

The man and the goat however, both have no idea how to even begin scaling the mountain, and thus they begin their exodus back to the Rabbi. Going back down the first mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The man bequeath unto the Rabbi his woes and the Rabbi gives him a grappling hook. So the man goes back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, across the beach, across the ocean, through the jungle, and up the mountain, to the steeper mountain.

Grabbing his trusty goat, the man fires off his grappling hook and begins his ascent. After a week of goat grabbing and grappling hooking, the man arrives at the summit to see his favorite thing in the whole world: a door, knowing the gig at this point he doesn’t even reach out for it, instead throwing himself down the mountain, slowly utilising his grappling hook to slow his descent. The man then continues on, going down the first mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The man asks the Rabbi for the key, to which the Rabbi told him that the door he was seeking to open wasn’t locked to begin with.

The man feeling a fool, meandered his way back down the hallway, down the stairs, through the savannah, through the desert, across the beach, across the ocean, through the jungle, up the mountain, and up, once again, the steeper mountain. He reaches out for the door to find it turn without a problem. He pushes it open revealing unto him a wide, imposing glacier. The man leaves his trusty goat behind and starts his travels across the glacier, the knocking noise getting truly louder with every step. If you could call them steps. The man had large trouble getting the traction he needed to continue going, so he started his procession back to the Rabbi.

He went down the steeper mountain, down the first mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, through the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The Rabbi helped out the man by giving him a snowmobile. The snowmobile however, slowed the man down a bit. He used it to go down the hallway much quicker than he would have, but he hit a major issue with the stairs. He slid the snowmobile down the stairs, barely keeping it from rolling him over. When he hit the savannah, he tied it to the elephant, and they crossed together at a slower pace than the man would have preferred.

The man then went across the desert and the beach using the snowmobile, and used it to go straight over the ocean until he ended up in the jungle. He then realised he had a massive issue. He had to push the snowmobile carefully through the entirety of the jungle and cut away at any plants that tried to catch it. After about one month, he managed to get to the first mountain. The man tied his grappling hook, to the snowmobile and got himself, and the goat on, and he fired it up. Miraculously, it caught and pulled up the snowmobile. The man then spent a month scaling up both mountains using this monotonous method.

When he finally arrived at the summit of the steeper mountain he set his snowmobile up in the glacier, he got on and flew across the glacier. In the distance the man could see something growing in size. It was a door. As he walked up to it, he hoped it was like the other door and remained unlocked. It was not. The man could hear the knocking noise, it was loud and booming at this point. He knew right past this door was the answered he sought, so with renewed vigor he began to go back. He went back across the glacier, leaving the snowmobile, back down the steeper mountain, down the first mountain, through the jungle, across the ocean, across the beach, through the desert, through the savannah, up the stairs, and down the hallway. The Rabbi greeted the man and gave him the last and final key.

The man went down the hallway, reflecting on his journey thus far. He walked down the stairs, falling down at the last step, narrowly avoiding ending his journey with a concussion. He walked across the savannah, sending his elephant off at the end to go free. He walked across the desert, doing the same with his camel as he did with the elephant. He walked across the beach, finding some neat sea shells along it. He paddled his raft across the ocean, falling out and nearly drowning at one point. He walked through the jungle, befriending a tiger along the way. He scaled both the mountains, trying to do the same with the goat as with the other two animals he had brought with him on his venture. The goat refused to leave and together they crossed the glacier. The pair got to the door and the man inserted the key, turning the knob, and he opened the door, revealing unto him the knocking noise.

Putin remains calm and whispers to the others “Don’t worry- I’m ex-KGB so I’m trained to handle situations like this. Just follow my lead.”
Putin is led in front of the firing squad and just as they are about to shoot, he pretends to panic and shouts out “FLOOD!” While the startled terrorists are looking around for the flood, Putin quickly runs off and escapes.

“Did you see what Putin did?” explains Merkel to Trump, “He…”

Trump interrupts, “Yeah. Waddaya think I am, stupid or something? I’m a genius. A very stable genius.”
Next, Merkel is led out to her execution. At the critical moment, she yells out “TORNADO!” and makes her getaway in the resulting confusion.

So there's Bernard sitting all on his lonesome in the corner of a big office floor looking pretty down. 
Jim, the friendliest and most popular guy in the office notices Bernard and says to a couple of his work mates ""Guys, Bernard is all alone, we have that extra ticket to clay pigeon shooting tonight after Paul got sick, let's invite Bernard""

The first three rock up and BANG BANG BANG each nail a clay pigeon. 
Then it's Bernards turn. 
He steps up the to the plate, physically shaking.
""PULL!"" goes Jim.

He had all the right muscles in all the right places, thick wavy hair, long powerful legs, dazzling smile, 6-pack abs. Ethel felt quite certain she could bounce a dime off his well-oiled buns.  


She figured, what the heck, nobody will ever know. I'll give him a call. ""Good evening, ma'am, how may I help you?""  


Oh my, he sounded so sexy! Afraid she would lose her nerve if she hesitated, so she rushed right in, ""I hear you give a great massage. I'd like you to come to my motel room and give me one. No, wait, I should be straight with you. I'm in town all alone and what I really want is sex. I want it hot and I want it NOW. Bring implements, toys, everything you've got in your bag of tricks. We'll go at it all night ... tie me up, cover me in chocolate syrup and whipped cream, anything and everything, I'm ready! Now how does that sound?""   


He said, ""That sounds absolutely fantastic, but you need to press 9 for an outside line.""",In town and all alone!!!,5

So they go over and strike up a conversation, buying them a few drinks. After a while, each of his friends ask one of the women to dance. As he's about to ask the third girl to dance he notices she's in a wheelchair and then sees him looking at her chair he feels awkward.
Not wanting to be a jerk he says, ""You want to go out there and show them how it's really done?""
Smiling she agrees and they have a great time.
After a while both of his friends took off with both of hers. Back at the table, he asks her if she's got a ride home.
She tells him, ""no but I can call someone to pick me up.""
Trying to be nice he tells her ""nonsense I'll give you a ride!""
On the ride they're laughing and getting along well and she tells him, ""I'm really enjoying spending time with you and am not ready for the night to end yet, why don't you pull over at that park and we can talk.""
They pull over and are talking for a while, when she finally kisses him.
""I'm sorry,"" she blushes, ""you're just so nice and I like you.""
""it's perfectly fine."" he smiles.
""Would you like to make love to me?"" she asks. He agrees and they start going at it, but with her legs it's hard to do in the truck.
She thinks and says, ""My arms are pretty strong, why don't you take me to the Monkey bars, I can hang and we can do it that way.""
So they go at it, finish up and he drives her home.
After he wheels her to the door her dad comes out.
""Come here boy,"" he says, gesturing him over.
Worried, he walks over, ""uhh yes sir?""
""I just wanted to thank you for driving her, that was damn decent of you and I haven't seen her smile like that in years.""
Feeling guilty, he says, ""It's no big deal I was glad to do it.""

I then proceeded to look at the condoms like I was an expert and picked one randomly, the pharmacist realized how clueless I was and asked:” This is your first time buying these isn’t it ?”, I admitted and said:” yeah...” and then she asked:” do you At least know how to use these” I replied with:” No not really”. 

The pharmacist took one condom out of the box and put it on her thumb and said with a smile:” it’s easy, you just put it like this”. But I still looked at her with the same clueless eyes as before, she then took a quick peek to see if anyone was around, there was no one.

She then grabbed my hand and took me to the back room and started undressing and laid down on the table, she then said:” Quickly,undress and put on the condom and fuck me”. I did as she said.

After finishing she told me:” So have you learnt how to use a condom?” To which I proudly replied while holding my thumb up:” YES”",I will never forget the story of when I bought my first condoms,9

His first assignment was in Venezuela, where he would travel to different villages and hold church services. On Sunday, he went to the main village, and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, he went to different smaller villages, which left Saturday to be a day of rest.

On his first day, which was a Saturday, he spent his time meeting the villagers and learning about their cultures and the villages. Then came Sunday, which was his first church services. He made it something about giving to others and being part of something larger than yourself, which really resonated with the townsfolk. After the mass, and old man hobbled over to the priest. “Father, may I please have half of a lemon?”
“What use do you have with half of a lemon?” Asked the priest.
“I cannot say.”
“Farewell. Here is your lemon.” And the old man just hobbled away as soon as the priest turned his back. 

Throughout the week, the priest traveled to different villages, bringing his knowledge and love to the villagers. It was the second Sunday since he had arrived, and the priest gave another very good sermon. After the mass, the same old man approached the priest and asked for the lemon, but right as the priest gave him the lemon, and before he could ask about it, the old man hobbled away. The priest was curious, but didn’t do much about it. 

This continued for another month, each week, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. Eventually, he decided he was going to follow the old man. So when he gave him the half of a lemon the next week, he chased after him. At first, the old man just hobbled along, but once he got into a small alley, he started running. Then, as he reached the open fields, he broke out into a full-on sprint. The priest, in no shape to follow, quickly slowed down, and returned to the village. After this encounter, he decided to train, so every day, he would wake up 1 hour early and go running. He did this for 3 whole months.

Finally, he felt ready to catch the old man. After giving another outstanding service, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. As soon as the left the church, the priest dashed after him. Once they got to a small alley, the old man started jogging. And then they reached the open fields, and he started sprinting. This time, however, the priest could keep up. The ran for about 2 miles, and reached a river with raging rapids. Rocks poked out randomly, and it led to a waterfall. Without hesitating, the old man dove into the water and swam across. The priest, unfortunately didn’t know how to swim, so he returned to the village. That was when he decided to wake up 2 hours earlier, 1 hour for running, and 1 hours for swimming. 

As 3 months passed, he determined that he was ready to chase the old man, and finally find out what he is up to. So after the church service, he gave the old man half of a lemon. When he hobbled out of the door, the priest was in hot pursuit. The old man turned down an alleyway and started jogging, and once he reached the fields, he started sprinting. As the arrived at the river, the old man dove in the water without a second thought. The priest, a little more careful than the old man, took his time crossing the water, as he didn’t want to get hurt. When he climbed out of the river, the old man was nowhere to be found. It seemed he ran off into the thick forest, but the priest knew mother about tracking people, so he returned to the village.

When he arrived, he asked the local hunters could teach him their ways. They said yes, but only if he went out hunting with them. So he did, going every Saturday with the hunters, and learning tricks such as tracking prey, cornering them, and how to not end up getting followed yourself. After 6 months, the priest was proficient in their ways, and he felt ready to chase the old man.

After giving yet another mass in the beautiful church, he handed the old man half of a lemon. The old man hobbled out of the door, and the priest followed. They turned down a dark alley, and once they were in the fields, it was a full sprint. As the reached the river, the old man dove in carelessly, as he did before.",I tried this once and it failed in new. Have I ever told you the story of the priest and the lemon? I think not.,0

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria that drove trains for a living,24

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

her haste to escape, the woman slid down the tree tobthe ground and got many splinters in her crotch. 
 
In considerable pain, she hurried to the nearest doctor. She told him she was an environmentalist and an anti-hunter and how she came to get all the
splinters. The doctor listened to her story with great patience and then told her to go into the examining room and he would see if he could help her.

Doc said “Son, I have some bad news for you....your penis is so large, that it has pushed your spleen, liver, stomach, and lungs further up into your body cavity, affecting your ability to speak, leaving you with a chronic stutter. We can perform surgery to shorten your penis, thereby relieving you of your stutter”
I really didn’t want to get my dick chopped, but dangit if I didn’t want to shake that stutter! So I told the doc
“O-o-ok, let’s proceed w-w-with the surgery”
So the doc inserted the IV and I was off to la la land. 
Hours later, I wake up, and my stutter is gone!
My whole life I have had this nagging speech impediment, and now I am finally cured!

But alas, there was still a problem...

All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher, who always yelled at him saying ""you are driving me crazy, Bashir"".

One day his mother went to check how he was doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is a disaster, getting very low marks and that she had never seen a dumb boy like Bashir in her whole career and that nothing would ever become of him.

The mother could not accept such a feedback and she took her son out from that school and she eventually shifted to another city.

25 years passed and the teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform in another city.

Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful. When she opened her eyes, she saw the handsome face of the doctor, smiling at her. Being under the anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk. In turn, the doctor was staring at her face which started turning blue. She was raising her hand trying to tell him something but in vain and eventually she died.

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw Bashir working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner.

One night he meets an old friend in the local pub. (Its a nice old pub, with a lovely barmaid with a beautiful rack, and hops and things hanging everywhere). Anyway, Stan is telling his old friend - Chester, how things are not going well and unless the building trade doesn’t pick up soon, Champion nails will go bust. Chester tells Stan about a new advertising company his mate  has set up. And arranges for Stan to meet up. The ad Co learns all about the nail business from Stan. They suggest an advertising campaign on TV at peak times. “We will go and get a commercial filmed especially tailored to promote Champion nails”. The ad exec says. A couple of weeks later, Stan goes to see the commercial that’s been made. On the tv screen appears ‘Champion Nails’  and the camera zooms in on a well presented pile of nails. “Our nails will fix anything” says the commentary. And then the picture changes to JC hanging on the cross! And yes you guessed it! Nailed with Champion nails. Buster is horrified and upset. He immediately turns the tv off and  shouts “Are you insane? You/I cannot have my company shown to have any part in this! For Gods sake, think of a better way to save my company”. The ad exec clearly seeing Stan is upset, promises to sort it out. “Leave it with me”, he says.
2 weeks later, Stan is back. On the tv screen again pops up ‘Champion nails’. And again the camera zooms in on a well presented pile of nails. “Our nails will fix anything” says the tv voice. And the next shot is an empty cross on a beautiful sandy beach. But, right in the very distance you can see 2 figures running anyway. The camera zooms in and its 2 Roman centurions chasing JC who is well ahead of them. The camera just catches up with the Romans as one turns to the other and says “this would not have happened if we had used Champion nails’",Champion Nails is in trouble.....,7

A man boarded an airplane and took his seat. As he settled in, he glanced up and saw the most beautiful woman boarding the plane.


He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat. As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation he blurted out, ""Business trip or pleasure?""


She turned, smiled and said, ""Business. I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston.

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your business role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really?"" he said. ""And what kind of myths are there?""

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.

""Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican descent who are the best.

""I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.""

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't even know your name.""

The man, excited to see his reward, follows the monk’s orders and meditates for a month straight. Afterwards, he goes once again to the monks, and the eldest presents him with a box full of silver.

The monk, seeing that the man has only slightly recovered, says, “Now, my child, I will give you another reward. However, to earn this one, you must meditate for three months straight.”

The man finds this task harder, but manages to push through it. Three months later, he arrives, bearded and ready for his reward. The eldest monk again presents him with a box, this time full of gold.

“My child, it seems you’ve almost gotten clean.” The monk said, “Now, I will give you the most valuable thing we own if you meditate for 6 months straight.”

When the king died, he portioned up his kingdom for his three sons. The eldest received the most prime piece of land and control of the king's 10 finest knights, each with 10 fine squires. The second son received a decent piece of land and command of the king's 5 pretty okay knights and their 5 pretty okay squires. The youngest received a small parcel of land and the king's oldest, weakest knight and his scrawny but cunning squire.

But what to do with the lake? The king forgot to portion up this fine piece of real estate in his will! The brothers argued amongst themselves over how to divide up control of the lake, but no agreement could be reached, and soon all three brothers sent their armies marching towards the lake to seize control.

The night before the conflict, the eldest brother's army of 10 knights, each with 10 squires, felt confident in their victory, and all the knights drank heavily in celebration of their anticipated triumph.

The middlest brother's army knew they'd have a tough time of it, and so all the knights sparred and exercised in preparation.

The youngest brother's lone, aged knight knew he had no chance, until his cunning squire came to him with a plan. The squire had spoken with an old witch and acquired a recipe for a legendary potion that would give one man the strength of a hundred and twenty five men. The squire brewed the potion and hung the cauldron from a nearby tree from a rope to cool until the morning.

Well...

Morning came, and the squires of all three armies realized that their plans had gone awry.

The eldest brother's knights were all far too hungover to fight.

The middlest brother's knights were all far too sore from their sparring to fight.

And the youngest brother's lone, aged knight had passed quietly in his sleep!

The squires decided they each had no choice but to fight in their knights' places! So the 100 fine squires of the eldest brother's army strapped on their knight's weapons and armor and headed to the battlefield.

The middlest brother's 25 squires reluctantly armed themselves as well and headed off.

And the youngest brother's scrawny but cunning squire took the pot down from where he'd hung it the night before, drank deeply of the potion within, and instantly felt his muscles swell, his senses heighten, and his skills enhance. Grabbing his knight's rusty weapons and armor, he charged off to meet the other squires in battle.

Well...

The battle raged on for hours, and when it finally ended, the result was horrifying. Bodies lay strewn about every which way and the air was thick with the scent of blood. And yet, standing over the carnage, mortally wounded but with his head held high, was the cunning squire of the youngest brother...

His first assignment was in Venezuela, where he would travel to different villages and hold church services. On Sunday, he went to the main village, and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, he went to different smaller villages, which left Saturday to be a day of rest.

On his first day, which was a Saturday, he spent his time meeting the villagers and learning about their cultures and the villages. Then came Sunday, which was his first church services. He made it something about giving to others and being part of something larger than yourself, which really resonated with the townsfolk. After the mass, and old man hobbled over to the priest. “Father, may I please have half of a lemon?”
“What use do you have with half of a lemon?” Asked the priest.
“I cannot say.”
“Farewell. Here is your lemon.” And the old man just hobbled away as soon as the priest turned his back. 

Throughout the week, the priest traveled to different villages, bringing his knowledge and love to the villagers. It was the second Sunday since he had arrived, and the priest gave another very good sermon. After the mass, the same old man approached the priest and asked for the lemon, but right as the priest gave him the lemon, and before he could ask about it, the old man hobbled away. The priest was curious, but didn’t do much about it. 

This continued for another month, each week, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. Eventually, he decided he was going to follow the old man. So when he gave him the half of a lemon the next week, he chased after him. At first, the old man just hobbled along, but once he got into a small alley, he started running. Then, as he reached the open fields, he broke out into a full-on sprint. The priest, in no shape to follow, quickly slowed down, and returned to the village. After this encounter, he decided to train, so every day, he would wake up 1 hour early and go running. He did this for 3 whole months.

Finally, he felt ready to catch the old man. After giving another outstanding service, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. As soon as the left the church, the priest dashed after him. Once they got to a small alley, the old man started jogging. And then they reached the open fields, and he started sprinting. This time, however, the priest could keep up. The ran for about 2 miles, and reached a river with raging rapids. Rocks poked out randomly, and it led to a waterfall. Without hesitating, the old man dove into the water and swam across. The priest, unfortunately didn’t know how to swim, so he returned to the village. That was when he decided to wake up 2 hours earlier, 1 hour for running, and 1 hours for swimming. 

As 3 months passed, he determined that he was ready to chase the old man, and finally find out what he is up to. So after the church service, he gave the old man half of a lemon. When he hobbled out of the door, the priest was in hot pursuit. The old man turned down an alleyway and started jogging, and once he reached the fields, he started sprinting. As the arrived at the river, the old man dove in the water without a second thought. The priest, a little more careful than the old man, took his time crossing the water, as he didn’t want to get hurt. When he climbed out of the river, the old man was nowhere to be found. It seemed he ran off into the thick forest, but the priest knew mother about tracking people, so he returned to the village.

When he arrived, he asked the local hunters could teach him their ways. They said yes, but only if he went out hunting with them. So he did, going every Saturday with the hunters, and learning tricks such as tracking prey, cornering them, and how to not end up getting followed yourself. After 6 months, the priest was proficient in their ways, and he felt ready to chase the old man.

After giving yet another mass in the beautiful church, he handed the old man half of a lemon. The old man hobbled out of the door, and the priest followed. They turned down a dark alley, and once they were in the fields, it was a full sprint. As the reached the river, the old man dove in carelessly, as he did before. The priest then followed, crossing quicker then he did previously. Once he climbed out of the river bank, he ran over to the woods. There, he used his knew found skills to track the old man to a clearing, where he was resting. The old man saw the priest, yelped, and ran away. The priest, still chasing the old man, followed him all the way to a gigantic tree. There, the old man climbed up the tree with ease. The priest, however, was unable to climb the tree, so he returned to the village.

He concluded that in order to catch the old man, he must learn how to climb, so every day, he would wake up 3 hours early, 1 hour of running, 1 hour of swimming, and 1 hour of climbing (whatever he could find, including the old church itself). After 3 months of doing this, he felt ready to finally catch the old man. After giving him half of a lemon, he chased him through the town, into the fields, swam through the river, and made it to the woods, where the old man stopped to rest in a new clearing. He ran to the giant tree, and climbed up like it was nothing, and the priest followed on his tail. When they reached the top, the old man started swinging from vine to vine, but the priest didn’t know which vines were poisonous and which would actually hold his weight, so he went back to the village.

There, he employed the help of the gardeners, who knew everything there is to know about plants. He spent 6 months of Saturdays learning the different plants, including vines. Finally, he was ready to catch the old man. When he gave the old man the lemon, he dashed out of the church to catch him. He ran through the field, swam through the river with ease, and chased him all the way to the gigantic tree, which the both climbed up relatively quickly. This time, the priest was able to follow the old man through the vines, all the way to a house. The old man dashed inside the little shack and locked the door. “Let me in” said the priest, but he got no response. So he went back home.

This time, he went to the locksmith, who agreed to help teach him to pick locks, but only if the priest learned how to make locks first. So the priest spent every Saturday for 6 months learning this trade, and eventually, he was ready to finally catch the old man. He handed him the lemon, and chased the old man through the village. The made it across the river, and into the clearing. He chased the old man all the way up the big tree, and they both swung across the vines like Tarzan. When the priest made it to the shack, he picked the lock open. He entered the little shack, which had no windows, and realized he couldn’t see. “Crap, I forgot a flashlight.” He exclaimed. 

The next week, he made sure he had a flashlight. He chased the old man all through the village, down to the river, out into the clearing, up the biggest tree in the woods, through the vines like a monkey, and all the way to the little shack. The priest picked the lock, and entered the house with the flashlight on. There, he saw the old man huddle in the corner. “ It’s ok. I only want to know what you are doing with these lemons.” He said.
The old man replied: “ Ok, but only if you promise to never tell a soul.”
“I swear to god” said the priest. 
So the old man walked up to him, and whispered into his ear. And like the priest promised, he never told a single soul what the old man does with those lemons.",Have I ever told you the story of the lemon and the priest? I don’t think so.,7

He make 2 rubles a month, and goes through many hardships daily, what with barely having enough money to feed his 29 children and provide clothes for them all.

One day, Yetzel goes to the recreation center in the city and sees something on the bulletin board: “Swimming lessons:20 rubles” and he immediately knows that’s what he wants to do, but, alas, poor Yetzel only makes 2 rubles a month, and this will take almost 2 years to save up for!

But Yetzel is nothing if not patient, and he saves up for 2 years until he has the funds to sign up for the swimming lessons.

Every day Yetzel goes to the factory, doing back breaking work, and suffering through the hardships his 39 children bring him. At night, he walks 37 miles to the city in order to practice his swimming. The recreation center closes at 8 pm, but he always manages to sneak in.

Until, one day, he sees a new message on the bulletin board: “Diving lessons. 35 rubles”

‘Oh, no, that’s much too much.’ Yetzel thinks. But his heart is already set on these diving lessons.

As Yetzel saves for almost 5 years rumors about him start to spread. Soon everyone in Russia has heard of this man who appears from nowhere and swims for hours every night before disappearing in the morning. He is supposedly the best swimmer in the world.

For 5 years Yetzel continued to suffer through the hardships that making almost no money from his backbreaking job and having 68 children tend to bring, until he had the funds for diving.

He walked the full 73 miles to the city and paid the teacher for the diving lessons, head held high and morale boosted.

Now, Yetzel didn’t just practice his breaststroke and freestyle, he also learned to fly through the air like a magnificent bird before crashing gracefully into the water.

The rumors continued. People all over the world started to know who Yetzel was.

But then the bulletin changed: “Cruise to America: 100 rubles”. Yetzel saw the message and knew 100 rubles was much too much.

But, that night he dreamed of America and the opportunities there, and the next morning he knew he would save.

Yetzel saved for 27 years. He lost his job in the metal factory and had to find a new one that only paid half a ruble per month. His 114 kids continued to bring him hardships and the 93 mile journey to the city he walked every night didn’t help.

But, one day, he bought his ticket and boarded the ship.

By now, everyone knew of Yetzel, and whispers could be heard around the deck.

“Is that Yetzel?”

“The famous swimmer?”

“I’ve never seen him in person before!”

They asked Yetzel if he would dive and swim for them in the ship’s pool, and he agreed, saying he would do it the next morning.

That night, the pool was drained because of AIDS, although no one on the ship was informed this was happening.

The next morning saw Yetzel climbing the diving board, too lost in his own thoughts to even notice there was no water in the pool.

“Yetzel! Yetzel! The pool is drained!” People shouted to him, tried to warn him, but he was too far up the ladder to hear.

Eventually he reached the top and bounced on the board a couple times before jumping off and going

Down

Down

Down

CRASH

Yetzel slammed into the bottom of the pool, but, to everyone’s surprised, he went through the 1st deck, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, all the way into the Atlantic Ocean.

He popped up for air along the side of the boat and the crew through him a life saver, pulling him in.

“Yetzel, how did you do that?” They asked.

“Well,” he smiled, “I’ve been through many hard ships in my life.”",A Russian metal worker named Yetzel lives in the countryside.,19

Once, twice, three times he smells the Viagra. The old man takes deep breaths. This is so weird, the old man is almost high from the smell, thinks the pharmacist. 

Then the old man gives the pharmacist a 100$ bill. The pharmacist does not have enough change on the cashier, and so he kindly asks the old man to go to the butcher shop opposite to the pharmacy to get some change. The old man says OK.

The old man enters the butcher shop, Viagra pills in his pocket, he says to the butcher to cut 80$ worth of his finest meat. He explains to the butcher that he gave 100$ to the pharmacist, and, since the pharmacist had no change, the old man is buying meat, since he was going to do so anyway. The butcher waves in distance to the pharmacist, and the pharmacist gestures OK to the butcher. The pharmacist thinks the butcher is just giving change to the old man. The old man takes the meat, the Viagra, and his 100$ bill and walks away. 

After that, the pharmacist and the butcher find out together that the old man had gotten the best of them. Lesson learned.

He had his mansion full of exotic animal trophies, the most complete collection over the world, lions, elephants, sharks, eagles, komodo dragons, whales, you name it, he was just so exceptionally skilled at hunting, there was no animal in the world that he couldn't hunt, so he was regarded as the animal terminator.

After a few years of not getting any new challenges, he gets a call from one of his sources while he was enjoying a cup of coffee in his living room.

Source: ""Hello AT(Animal Terminator), I've got the perfect opportunity for you to come out of retirement!""

AT: ""Oh yeah? What is it this time? Let me remind you that the last time it took me 20 seconds to handle the giant killer orca at the pacific""

Source: ""It's a gorilla, he's deep in the amazonas, and it's...""

AT: ""A gorilla?? Pfft, I've got over 14 gorilla trophies in my living room, unless this one has the size of an adult elephant it's not worth my time""Source: ""But AT, hear me out! This gorilla is no ordinary gorilla, although not abnormally big, it's very strong, very tough, no local hunting team could handle it so far, and they are very scared as every time they tried to hunt it, the gorilla ended up grabbing one of the hunters and rapped him on the spot, after being raped the hunters are not willing to go back and try again... that's why they asked me to call you, as you're the expert! It could be good for you to come back to the game you know, you'll get back on the top of the hunting world""

AT: ""Alright, I'm a bit bored lately anyways, so I'll land there within 13 hours, calling my jet now"".

Still a bit skeptical, the hunter packed his regular gear, hopped on the jet and head over the amazonas jungle. Upon arrival, the local hunting team greeted him as the hero he was, they put a team to assist him in this mighty gorilla hunt. They drove him to this gorilla sighting zone, and AT ordered them to stay put and watch.

AT quickly moved through the jungle, and barely 20 meters away he saw the mighty beast, it was playing with a dead tree trunk as it were just a branch. ""A strong gorilla indeed"", he thought, ""but just wait until he knows me"".

AT pulled out a banana from his pocket, threw it between him and the gorilla, the gorilla saw it and immediately moved towards the bait. ""Such a basic animal, I guess it's not as special as they said it was..."", AT was disappointed, as he aimed his anesthesia gun towards the sky and shot it, the dart drew a perfect parabola in the sky, and on it's way down it accelerated and landed just onto the gorilla's neck, and the gorilla fell immediately. ""WOW, he is so great!!"" the crowd was impressed by his skills.

As AT got closer to the animal, thinking he could just get his 15th gorilla trophy, the gorilla opened his eyes, let out a grin, grabbed AT and rapped him on the spot while the others watched in panic.

The locals dragged AT back onto the jeep and to the hospital, where AT rested for a day. During that day AT blamed himself for underestimating this primate, wondering if he was too old for this or if he got rusty on the art of hunting, but he was not willing to give up, because he was the most skilled hunter in the world, what would people think if he couldn't handle a gorilla!

The next day AT packed and headed back to the forest with the team. He saw the gorilla again, this time it was playing with a boulder.

AT drew out a rope gun, shot it at the gorilla's feet and arms, ropes immediately tightened upon contact with the objective, the gorilla woke up in shock, as AT was already shooting out 3 anesthesia darts, two landed on the chest and another landed on the neck. In a matter of seconds, the gorilla passed out to the ground. AT got close, and shot another 2 darts, gave the gorilla a little kick on the back to make sure this time it was out. ""OMG he did it this time!"" the crowd cheered. As AT pulled out his knife to behead the gorilla, it turned back, broke out of the ropes, let out a grin, grabbed AT and rapped him on the spot, again, and even more fiercely this time.

AT was back at the hospital for a week as he could barely walk this time. When he recovered, he decided to kill the gorilla this time before beheading it, it wouldn't be optimal for his record, but he was determined to take out this beast one way or another.

AT packed the big guns this time, AK-47s, bazookas, hand grenades, etc. There's no way he's getting out of this one, he thought. He headed to the jungle once more, and found the gorilla napping beside a tree. AT pulled out the grenade, threw it with the exact force so it arrived beside the ape, as the grenade exploded he pulled out the AK-47 and emptied the cartridge towards it, after the dust dissipated, the gorilla was lying on the ground, and just to be sure this time, AT put the bazooka on his shoulder, aimed and shot one last time. The blast made the gorilla fly upon the skies and then hit the ground right beside AT's feet. AT let out a sigh of relief, pulled out his knife to behead his prey, as the gorilla opened it's eyes, let out a grin, and said: ""You really are gay, aren't you??""

He was concerned that his wife would need to be satisfied while we was away so we went to an adult toy store to find her a dildo.  Not impressed with their selection he asked the guy behind the counter if he had any other dildos in the back.  The clerk said, ""I do believe I have something that will make your wife very happy"".  The clerk returns with an old wooden box and blows the dust off of it.  He opens it up to reveal and normal looking run of the mill dildo.  ""What the hell is so special about this?"", asked the husband.  ""Oh, this isn't an ordinary dildo.  This is voodoo dick and it possesses powers that you need to see to believe."", the clerk said.  

The husband was very skeptical, but the clerk said, ""Watch this."".  The clerk steps back and says in a demanding voice, ""Voodoo dick!  The door!"".  Suddenly the dildo rises out of the box, points towards the door, flies over to it, and starts thrusting at the door like there is no tomorrow.  ""Holy shit! That is amazing!!!  I have never seen anything like that!!"", the husband screamed.  The clerk says, ""You tell voodoo dick what to fuck and it will fuck it.  It won't stop until you tell it.  Oh, and to put it back in the box simply say this, 'Voodoo dick.  Home' ""  The dildo flies back to the box and gently settles back into its home.  The husbands throws money on the counter and takes voodoo dick home.

The husband prepares a nice dinner for his wife as he is leaving the next day.  As a surprise he gives her voodoo dick and explains to her how to use it, ""Just say its name and whatever hole you want fucked and this thing will go to town!"".  A couple days past and the wife misses her husband, so she decides to give voodoo dick a try.  She lays down on the bed, spreads her legs, and says the magic words, ""Voodoo dick.  My pussy."".  Voodoo dick rises up, floats over to her, and begins to fuck her.  It fucks her like she has never been fucked before.  She is in sheer ecstasy.  She enjoys voodoo dick for almost an hour and is finally all set.  However, her husband forgot to tell her how to put voodoo dick back in the box.

She tries to call her husband in a panic but doesn't answer and she has no idea where he bought it either.  She doesn't know what to do and decides to go to the hospital.  She throws on a robe, gets in her car, and begins to drive to the hospital.  Voodoo dick is still fucking her while she is driving so she is having trouble focusing on the road.  Voodoo dick does such an amazing job that she orgasms while driving and looses control of the car and almost causes an accident.  A cop sees her car swerve, puts on his lights, and follows her.  She swerves yet again almost hitting a pedestrian this time due to voodoo dick's amazing skills.  She sees his lights and pulls over hoping that he can help her.  The cop approaches the car and she rolls down her window.  ""What seems to the problem, ma'am?  I saw you swerving all over the place back there and you almost hit a guy.""  The wife explains the entire situation while holding back yet another orgasm, ""See officer there is this voodoo dick that my husband got me because he is away.  He told me to say 'Voodoo dick.  My pussy' and it would fuck me like I wouldn't believe.  Well it is fucking me right now and I can't focus because it feels so good.  My husband didn't tell me how to stop it, so I am driving to the hospital right now to get this voodoo dick to stop fucking me!!"".  The officer laughs and says, ""Yeah right, ma'am.

Anyway, he goes to his Rabbi, who says ""Peter, I don't want you picking Judaism because it's the only religion you know. Go out in the world and see what other religions there are.""

So out he goes into the world, and his first stop is the Catholic Church. He finds a priest and says, ""Father, I'd like to become a Catholic. Can you help me?""

Skeptical, the priest asks, ""OK. If you want to be a Catholic, tell me: Where was Jesus born?""

Uncle Pete stopped and thought. He had no earthly idea where he was born, and so he took a guess.

""Pittsburgh?"" he asked timidly.

""PITTSBURGH?"" thundered the priest. ""Get out of my sight, and come back when you're serious!""

So, across the street to the Methodists he went, and he got the same routine.

""Where was Jesus born?"" asked the minister.

Oh, hell, I don't know, thought Uncle Pete. He knew Pittsburgh wasn't the right answer, but beyond that...

""Philadelphia?"" asked Pete.

""For Goodness sake Peter, if you're not going to take this seriously I can't help you!"" scowled the minister.

Defeated, he returns to the rabbi and told him he'd quite had his fill of other religions, and he wanted to be a Jew.

""Ok,"" says the rabbi. ""We'll get started right away.""

""So you don't want to know where Jesus was born?""

""No, no,"" said the Rabbi with a soft chuckle. ""That doesn't matter to me.""

""Well, just for my own knowledge, where WAS Jesus born exactly?""

When the pyramid was ready, the proud builders were lined up in front of the pyramid as the pharao came to inspect the end result.

The other 99 builders started chasing the man on the camel but unfortunately he was too fast and they couldn't catch him.  


Of course the pharao still wanted a pyramid, so the remaining 99 builders rebuilt the whole damn thing. With one person less it took a bit longer, but as they were loyal to their pharao, they worked on it dutifully. As the pyramid was done for the 2nd time, the pharao came for the inspection again. Suddenly the same man on the camel raced past the pyramid and with a lot of noise it collapsed again! One builder was killed but the other 98 ran after the man with the camel. And again, they could not catch him.  


The pharao became a bit impatient and ordered another pyramid ... pyramid done ... inspection ... man on camel ... pyramid collapses ... one builder killed ... man on camel got away.  


97 builders start over ... pyramid done ... etc etc (imagine this can be as long as you wish ;-)).  


Finally, only 2 builders rebuilt the pyramid. As the pharao came for inspection, the guy on the camel passed again and of course, the pyramid collapsed again. One builder was killed and it took every bit of strength and endurance of the last builder to catch up with the man on the camel. But this time, he succeeds!  


Totally out of breath, he asks the man: ""Every time we build a pyramid, you come by on your camel and suddenly the pyramid collapses. What have you got to do with that?""
