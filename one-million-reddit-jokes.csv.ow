A little bit later the second guy came back with 10 bananas and the chieftain told him:

 The only time he got any relief was when he was out ploughing with his old mule. 

He tried to plough a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch.
Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. 

Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.

All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. 

Killed her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. 

When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. 

This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men.

The old farmer said: ""Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement.""

""And what about the men?"" the minister asked.

""They wanted to know if the mule was for sale.""",The hillbilly's nagging wife.,19

Finally the asshole spoke up and said it should be in charge.

All the other organs laughed at the asshole, telling it how absurd it was to have an asshole for a boss.

The asshole felt extremely insulted, and puckered hard enough to make diamonds, refusing to function at all.

Since the asshole puckered so hard and refused to let go, the brain soon became fevered, the eyes crossed, the legs weak, the hands limb, even the heart and lungs had trouble doing their job.

In the end all the organs begged the brain to please allow the asshole to be in charge, and thats how it ended up.

For 40 years he lived in his mother's house, working his way through college.  His mother's ambition was for him to become a doctor.  He applied to medical school but wasn't accepted and had to settle for dental school.  

Finally, he graduated opened a practice, moved out of his mother's house and began to live an independent life.  After a few months, he met a beautiful woman at church, fell in love, and was engaged to be married.  His mother had always been jealous and protective and for a long time hadn't even let him date girls.  He told his finance that he was nervous about having sex for the first time.  For his mother's sake, he told her wanted to save himself until they were married.

The finance loved him and was understanding.  As much as she wanted to consummate their love, she would wait.  Finally, the day of their wedding arrived.  Although it was a beautiful ceremony, the bridegroom couldn't enjoy it.  All he could think of was how nervous he was about the wedding night.

That evening, his panic grew as he lay in bed in his pajamas, waiting while his bride dressed in the bathroom.  Finally, she emerged from the bathroom looking absolutely beautiful, wearing make up and a sheer negligee.  The bridegroom's panic became even more unbearable as his wife approached the bed.  She saw his nervousness and asked what was wrong -- isn't this what he had waited for for so long?

The dentist began to cry.  Unable to hold back, he finally confessed:  ""My mother always warned me about women.  She said that I should never have sex because the sharp teeth that women have ""down there"" would bite off my penis.""  

His bride was shocked.  She said, ""How could your mother say that?  It's not true!""  The bridegroom said, ""I know my mother wouldn't lie to me.  I'm so afraid!""  His wife said, ""Oh honey, I love you so much.  Let me prove to you that it's not true.  There is nothing to worry about.  Here, let me lie on the bed.  I'll spread my legs and you can look and see that there are no teeth down there.  It's a terrible lie!""

Finally, after some persuading, her husband agreed.  He crawled down under the covers.  His wife spread her legs, and he looked closely, seeing a vagina for the first time.  After about ten minutes, the husband emerged from under the covers shaking his head.  His wife put her hand under his chin and made him look into her eyes.  ""Oh honey,"" she said, ""now you see, there was nothing to worry about.  There are no teeth down there.""   Her husband looked her in the eyes, shook his head, and said, ""And with the condition of those gums it's no wonder!""",The 40 Year Old Virgin,12

Noxious smoke rises from the crevice, hellish noises, glow of fires in the depths, and in the middle of this all an enormous arse covered with ugly hair and boils rises above the little mortified hedgehog. Then the ass, using its buttcheeks grabs the apple from the hedgehog's back, and vanishes with it in the ravine.

The crack rapidly seals itself, clouds dissipate, wind stops, and the little hedgehog just stands in the sunny forest as it was before, wincing, and missing his apple. ""What was that?"" he mewls quietly.

Suddenly cold wind rises. Sky darkens, clouds gather, thunders rumble, earth is shaking. Earth cracks open again, then amidst the smoke the enormous arse reappears. Then in a deep, rumbling voice, it answers ""That was a Red Delicious.""",A little hedgehog and an ass,4

When he finally came of age, he applied to where he had only dreamed of working: the West Texas Sheriff's Department. After a series of tests and interviews, the Chief Deputy finally  called him into his office for the young man's last interview.

The Chief Deputy said, ""You're a big strong kid and you can really shoot. So far your qualifications all look good, but we have, what you might call, an ""Attitude Suitability Test"", that you must take before you can be accepted. We just don't let anyone carry our badge, son.""

Then, sliding a service pistol and a box of ammo across the desk, the Chief said, ""Take this pistol and go out and shoot: 

* six illegal aliens

* six ambulance-chasing lawyers

* six meth dealers

* six Muslim extremists

* six Democrats

* and a rabbit.""

""Why the rabbit?"" queried the applicant.

""You pass,"" said the Chief Deputy. ""When can you start?""

I asked him what the hell he could be laughing at and he said: ""for the past few weeks, I've seen a lady outside on her front step whenever I pull up in the morning, wearing a robe. Yesterday, she opened the robe and showed me her tits. I was so excited, I pulled in her driveway and followed her inside. When we got to lovin, I heard her husband was home and ditched the place. I ran across the street to these roofers and none of them assholes believed me! They started making fun of me and calling me a fag, so I packed up and left. What them assholes don't know is that I pissed in their bucket of nails before I left, and now they've got those nails in their mouth and shit.""",My dad told me this over dinner with grandparents,3

He tried to keep flying but his wings got so heavy with the ice that he fell on the grass. 

A cow was on the field having her lunch when she saw the frozen bird lying on the ground. 
She approached him sniffed his little body and then pooped on him. 

The little bird felt his body getting warmer, the ice melted due to the hot poop and he recovered his strength, he was still stuck on the poop tho, but it didn't hold him to fill his little lungs and start singing a joyful sing. 

A cat was sleeping under a tree nearby and he was awaken by the bird singing. 
He stood up, went to the pile of shit, dug on it until he finds the little bird.

Then, the cat cleaned all the shit from the bird and ate him. 

Moral of the story:

Not everyone who poops on you wants to jeopardize you, and not everyone who takes you out of the shit wants your well being. 
Yet: when you are too happy, remind to keep your mouth shut. Not everybody likes to hear about your happiness. ",A happy little bird,7

On the third tee the husband said, ""Honey, be very careful when you drive the ball don't knock out any windows. It'll cost us a fortune to fix."" 

The wife teed up and shanked it right through the window of the biggest house on the course. The husband cringed and said, ""I told you to watch out for the houses. Alright, let's go up there, apologize and see how much this is going to cost."" 

They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, ""Come on in."" They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer. A man on the couch said, ""Are you the people that broke my window?"" 

""Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,"" the husband replied. 

""No, actually I want to thank you. I'm a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. You've released me. I'm allowed to grant three wishes -- I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself."" 

""OK, great!"" the husband said. ""I want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life."" ""No problem-it's the least I could do. And you, what do you want?"" the genie said, looking at the wife. ""I want a house in every country of the world,"" she said. 

""Consider it done,"" the genie replied. 

""You know what, genie, maybe we can repay you by making one of YOUR wishes come true... what's your wish, genie?"" the husband said. 

""Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, I haven't had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife."" 

The husband looks at the wife and said, ""Well, we did get a lot of money and all those houses, honey. I guess I don't care."" The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours. 

After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife, and said, ""How old is your husband, anyway?"" 

""35,"" she replied. 

""And he still believes in genies? That's amazing!""

Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

She worked as a bank teller, so I'd simply wait till she fell asleep -- Then I'd sneak into the night.

When I returned, I'd adjust the seat, radio, and mirrors back how they were before.  The less questions, I figured, the better, but I grew less careful over time.  

First, she complained that her AC settings were unreliable; I agreed, bemoaning the shoddy electronics in European cars.  Later, she started to swear her seat was never in *exactly* the same position; that was the first time I told her she was delusional.  She never brought up her seat position after that.

It worked so well that I kept at it.  She began to trust me more than she trusted herself; I could practically get away with anything.  Sometimes I would get home only seconds before the sound of her alarm. 

Then one morning she went out to the car, came right back inside, and dragged me by the collar out of the apartment; I guess manipulation only goes so far.  

As I sat on the curb and mulled it over, one thought crowded out the rest:  it was painfully likely that the gaslight was up.","In my early 20s, I was a scumbag - no car, no house, no job.

You're going to have a great time. We only have one rule in heaven, and that is to never, ever, no matter what, step on a duck.""
""Ducks?""
""Yes, if you do, you will receive a terrible punishment. You may enter."" So the friends enter heaven, and much to their suprise, there are ducks everywhere. Every square yard there were probably 2 ducks. The first friend takes the warning lightly and accidentally steps on a duck the first day, and as punishment the most hidiously ugly person gets put in front of him to look at for all of eternity. The person was like uglier than the mcpoyles, he/she (because the friend coudn't tell if it was a boy or a girl) was really really ugly.
So the second and third friends see this and say to themselves that they would never step on a duck. But sure enough the second friend steps on a duck in the third week and gets the same punishment as the first friend. So the third friend vows to never move, and only move if absolutely necessary,
After about 7 months a beautiful woman comes down from the sky, and I'm talking crazy hot, almost angelic. The third friend gets to look at her forever, and asks, ""what could I have possibly done to deserve this?""
And she says, ""I don't know but I stepped on a duck.""

The musician, not wanting to displease the glorious leader, sets to work immediately, and writes one of the greatest pieces he has ever written. A month passes, and the big day arrives. The musician stands in front of the orchestra, the rulers looking on, and signals the orchestra to play... and they absolutely butcher it.

The dictator, furious, demands that the musician be executed immediately. The guards drag him to a grimy cell, and ask him what he'd like for his last meal. 

""I want the hottest curry you can cook!"" demands the musician. 

The guards oblige, and bring the musician the spiciest curry he's ever tasted. He forces it down, and is led to the electric chair. The guards strap him down, pull the lever, and...  nothing. The musician is completely unharmed! The dictator, having witnessed the miracle, decides to give the musician a second chance to compose a piece of music for the country's rulers.

The musician once again sets to work composing a beautiful piece. The big day arrives, the musician stands in front of his orchestra, and, once again, they completely ruin the piece. It was nothing like the musician intended it to sound! The fuming dictator  again orders the execution of this incompetent musician.

As before, the musician is asked what he would like for his last meal.

""I want the hottest curry you can cook, and even hotter than last time!"" orders the musician.

The guards set to work and cook the musician the hottest curry they possibly can, throwing in a whole concoction of chili peppers and spices.

The musician, sweating, struggles to finish the curry, but chokes it down nonetheless. The guards once again lead him to the electric chair, and strap him down. They throw the switch, sparks fly, and once again, by some will of the gods, the musician is completely alive and well.

The dictator is stunned. He offers the musician one final chance to compose the greatest piece he can, and one chance only. The musician sets to work composing his greatest masterpiece, and finally the day of the concert arrives. The ruling classes look on as the musician takes to his podium. He raises his baton, takes a deep breath, and signals the orchestra to start playing.

The musician trembles. The orchestra are horribly out of key, out of time, and playing all the wrong chords. The dictator demands the concert be halted, and has the musician thrown in jail once again. 

As before, the musician is asked what he would like for his final meal.

""The hottest curry that has ever been cooked!"" instructs the musician.

The dictator, upon hearing this request, snaps, ""absolutely not! I've had enough with you cheating death with your outrageously hot curries!""

The musician is dragged straight to the electric chair, and strapped down. He has wires connected to him in every place possible, and just for luck, the dictator announces that he will personally throw the switch this time.

The guards look on in angst. The dictator pulls the switch. Sparks fly and generators groan. The dictator holds the switch down for minutes on end before the power finally blows, yet, much to his amazement, the musician is completely unscathed!

""But, how?!"" demands the dictator. ""No man should survive that!""

collection plates each Sunday. Someone suggested to him that perhaps he
might be able to hypnotize the congregation into giving more. ""And just
how would I go about doing that?"" he asked.

""It is very simple. First you turn off the air conditioner so that the
auditorium is warmer than usual. Then you preach in a monotone.
Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a slow arc
above the lectern and suggest they put 20 dollars in the collection
plate.""

So the very next Sunday, the reverend did as suggested, and lo and
behold the plates were full of 20 dollar bills. Now, the preacher did
not want to take advantage of this technique each and every Sunday. So
therefore, he waited for a couple of weeks and then tried his mass
hypnosis again.

Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerized, the chain
on the watch broke and the watch hit the lectern with a loud thud and
springs and parts flew everywhere.

""Crap!"" exclaimed the pastor.

The woman found an old rusty coat hanger left on the ground.  She looked at it and said, “I don’t know how to use this.”

She bowed her head and asked God to send her some help. Within 5 minutes a beat-up motorcycle pulled up, driven by a bearded man who was wearing an old biker skull rag. 

He got off his cycle and asked if he could help.

She said, “Yes, my daughter is sick. I’ve locked my keys in my car. I must get home. Please, can you use this hanger to unlock my car?”

He said, “Sure.”  He walked over to the car, and in less than a minute… the car door was open.

She hugged the man and through tears, softly said, “Thank you, God, for sending me such a very nice man.”

The man heard her little prayer and replied, “Lady, I am not a nice man.  I just got out of prison yesterday; I was in prison for car theft.”

The woman hugged the man again, sobbing, “Oh, Thank You, God! You even sent me a professional.”

Dave says he can drive them to the government office and show them, but Ling interjects, “you can't change your name! It has been in our family for many generations. If father finds out he will disown you!”

But Ving has his mind set and after school they head over. Ling insists on coming along and to tries convince Ving to stop, but with no luck. 

On the way Dave asks Ving what name he would like, and Ving says, “Hmm, I want something cool; like Bruce Lee!”

So they get to the government building and Ving gets the proper forms from the teller. He is nearly finished when he starts to cry.

“I cannot do this,” he says, and tosses the forms back to the teller.

However, because of odd rules, he has to pay a small fee to cancel the process at this point.

“Fine, we will pay,” says Ling, taking out some money, “I'm just glad you are not going through with it.”

Suddenly, an elderly, short Asian man bursts through the door. He walks up furiously to Ling and says,

post,61atv4,2qh72,jokes,false,1490381402,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/61atv4/truckers_hobby/,self.jokes,,"A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see walking down the side of the road. Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud ""THUMP"" and then he would swerve back on the road. 

One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitch hiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over. He asked the priest, ""Where are you going, Father?"". ""I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!"", replied the priest. ""No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb in the truck"". The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road. 


Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud ""THUD"". 

Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, ""I'm sorry Father. I thought I missed that lawyer"". 

""That's okay"", replied the priest. ""I got him with the door!

 It's probably not a good night to go to jail.

 Getting married at 22 sounds a lot like leaving a party at 9:30pm.

 Probably should not have driven home from the bar last night.. especially considering I walked there.

 For once I would like to find a babysitter that doesn't get all upset when she gets to my house and realizes I don't have kids.

 I'm not saying women are smarter than men, but its kinda ironic that there's so few known women serial killers and so many unsolved murders.

 My boss just farted. I asked him if he was trying to get the condom out. 
 He's mad now.

 Apparently, when your boss asks you to get a cake for a coworker's 60th birthday, 'cake' is not necessarily code for 'stripper.'

 And apparently you can't get a sick leave just because you're sick of seeing everyone at the office.

 My resume is really just a list of things I never want to do again.

 My girlfriend left me for a hindu guy. Anyway, he'll treat her better - they worship cows.

 how much morning wood, would my girlfriend suck, if she ever sucked and if I had a girlfriend. Whatever.

 I never try to make guests feel at home. If they wanted to feel at home, they should have stayed there.

 My wife is playing hard to get. 
 Rid of.

 Great! I just wet my pants. Now people are gonna think I spilled a drink on myself.

 My insurance does not cover Jesus taking the wheel. I checked.

 The noblest of dogs is the hot dog, it feeds the hand that bites it. 

 Today I bought cupcakes without sprinkles. 
 Diets are hard.

 I wish all my younger siblings would appreciate how low I set the bar for them. 

 I just wrote a check for 6 dollars, so I don't really wanna hear about your 'summer' house.

 I told my Mom that I was going to the Apple store and she said, ""You sound like you're 4 - it's the grocery store"". 

 My neighbors were listening to some pretty cool music until the arseholes asked me to turn it down.

 Two dead canaries for sale on e bay, 
 not going cheep. 

 I also saw a digital radio going cheap as it's stuck on full volume, can't turn that down.

The mom was shocked at the feedback and withdrew her son from school and moved out of Detroit, relocating to Cleveland.
25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an incurable cardiac condition. All the doctors strongly advised her to have heart surgery, which only one surgeon could perform at the Cleveland Clinic.
Left with no other options, the teacher decided to have the operation, which was successful. When she opened her eyes after the surgery she saw a handsome doctor smiling down at her.
She wanted to thank him, but could not talk. Her face started to turn blue, she raised her hand, trying to tell him something but eventually died.
The doctor was shocked and was trying to work out what went wrong .
When he turned around he saw our friend Tyrone working as a janitor in the clinic, who had unplugged the oxygen equipment in order to connect his floor buffer!
