But he was kind of a rascal and taught them to say some rude phrases whenever anyone new walked into the room. 

Their favourite was, “Hi, we’re hookers.  Want to have some fun?”

The lady was quite embarrassed by these two birds and was at her wit’s end.

However, because her father was so fond of them, she was reluctant get rid of them.  

Then she remembered her priest raised parrots.  In fact, he had two male parrots that were quite remarkable — they could even say the rosary.

So she asked his advice.

He suggested putting the two rude birds in with his birds on the chance they could teach them some better language.

So, she brought the birds over and placed them in the cage with the priest’s birds.

Of course, the first thing they said was, “Hi, we’re hookers.  Want to have some fun?”

One of the priest’s parrots looked over at the other and said, “You can put away the rosary beads, Larry, our prayers have been answered.”",A woman ended up caring for two female parrots . . .,20

""If I do 200mph, will you take off your clothes?"" he asked.

""Yes!"" said his adventurous girlfriend. And as he gets up to 200, she peeled off all her clothes.

""But I can't. I'm naked and my clothes are gone!""

""Take my shoe"", he said, ""and cover yourself."" 

Holding the shoe over her pubes, the girl ran down the road and found a service station. Still holding the shoe between her legs, she pleaded to the service station proprietor, ""Please help me! My boyfriend's stuck!"" The proprietor looked at the shoe and said, ""There's nothing I can do...he's in too far.""",Sportscar,876

A woman is visiting her mother in the other side of the country and wants to bring her parrot but the only flight she can find is a no smoking and no parrots flight.

The woman thinks she can get away with it so she stuffs the parrot in her coat and gets on the flight.

After the plane gets to cruising altitude, the pilot, smoking a big cigar, comes out and walks down the isle talking to the passengers.

He passes by the woman and hears a squawk and says, ""what was that?"" The woman says ""nothing"" quickly but the parrot squawks again and the pilot rips her coat open and and says ""YOU CANT HAVE A PARROT ON HERE"" and throws the parrot out the window. The woman rips the cigar out of the pilots mouth saying ""WELL YOU CANT BE SMOKING EITHER"" and throws the cigar out the window.

The woman, grumbling, goes back to her seat and the pilot, grumbling, goes back to the cockpit and hears a knock.

before in your case; I'm going to let you decide

Bill replied, ""Well, what's the difference between

St. Peter said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both
places briefly, if it will help your decision.""

""Fine, but where should I go first?""
""I'll leave that up to you.""

""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first.""

So bill went to Hell. It was beautiful, clean ,
sandy beach with clear waters and lots of
bikini-clad women running around, playing in the
water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was
shining; the temperature perfect.

He was very pleased.

""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is
Hell, I really want to see Heaven!""

""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went.

Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels
drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was
nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thought
for a quick minute, and rendered his decision.

""Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,""
he told St. Peter.

""Fine,"" retorted St. Peter, ""as you desire.""

So Bill Gates went to Hell. Two weeks later, St.
Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to
see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there,
he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming
amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and
tortured by demons.

""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill.

Bill responded, his voice filled with anguish and
disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing
like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't
believe this is happening! What happened to that
other place, with the beautiful beaches, the
scantily-clad women playing in the water?!???""

And over the years, they’d fished nearly every river, every stream, every pond in the great state of Texas. 

One day, they were sitting out on Merle’s front porch, sipping cold beer and lamenting the fact that they’d pretty much run out of places to fish. Suddenly Clyde shouted “Merle! I’ve got it! Check this out!!” He handed the dog-eared copy of Field and Stream that he’d been reading over to Merle. Staring him in the face was a full page ad for ice fishing in Minnesota. Merle’s eyes lit up. “Let’s go!” he said, “no time to lose – it says fishing season started yesterday up there!!”

After a day’s drive they reached a little fishing town on the edge of a frozen lake. “Man,” Clyde exclaimed, “will you look at that. Not another fisherman in sight! We’ll have the whole lake to ourselves!!”
 “Let’s go into town and find us an outfitter shop” said Merle, “we’re burning daylight.”

“Howdy” Clyde said to the proprietor as they entered the store.

“What can I do for you?” he responded.

 “We need a couple of Minnesota fishing licenses and some ice fishing gear.”

“Have you ever been ice fishing before?” the proprietor asked. 

“No” said Merle, “but we’re fast learners. We’ve been fishing in Texas for most all our lives.” “Yea” Clyde added, “Don’t worry about us. You just need to give us the stuff we’ll need. And make it the good stuff - money is no object.”

“Well come this way boys. I’ll fix you right up.” 

Twenty-five minutes later the checkout counter was piled high with provisions - a small propane heater, lanterns, ice chests, bait, heavy winter coats and the like.” Clyde paid the man and they started scooping up their purchases. As they headed for the door the proprietor said “Wait! I almost forgot the most important item you’ll need.” With that, he held out an icepick which Merle managed to take with his free hand. “No charge” said the proprietor. 

An hour later, Merle returned to the store. It was obvious he had been working pretty hard. “I need another one of them icepicks” he told the proprietor.

 “You know that was just a standard icepick I gave you earlier”, the proprietor said. “I’ve got some titanium ones in the back that are a lot better. They’re kind of high priced though. Twenty bucks a piece.” He’d ordered a whole box of them last season and hadn’t sold a single one. This could be the opportunity he’d been looking for.

“I’ll take one” Merle said. He waited while the proprietor retrieved one from the storeroom, then paid the man and hurried out the door.

An hour later Clyde returned. “I need a couple more icepicks!” he said, trying to catch his breath, “that ice is mighty thick out there!” The proprietor smiled and went to get two more from the back. “It must be thick,” he thought, “these icepicks are made of titanium!” Clyde paid the man and left the store.

Two hours later both Merle and Clyde returned. Sweat soaked through their shirts and it was obvious they’d been working very hard. “We need all the icepicks you got!” Merle said. 

“Well,” said the proprietor, “they come 24 to a box and I just opened the box for you.” “We’ll take all the rest!”, Clyde gasped. 

The proprietor brought out the box and handed it over to him. “Here ya go,” he said “that’ll be $420.” Clyde dug into his wallet for the cash, paid the proprietor and they hurried for the door. The proprietor’s curiosity got the best of him. “Say,” he said “pardon me for asking. But have you boys done any fishing yet?”

“FISHING!” Merle responded, “WE HAVEN’T EVEN GOT THE DAMN BOAT IN THE WATER YET!!”

On their 8th birthday their father decided it was time for them to start making some money for the family. You see, they weren't particularly wealthy and he and his wife rarely spoke.


So he took the twins with him to the market one afternoon and spoke with a store owner. ""Afternoon sir, my kids are looking for some work"". So he discussed terms with the man and agreed that every week he'd come down to the store with the kids and one of them, he didn't need both for the amount of work at his store, would help out for a few hours while the father did his erands.


Their father was a fair man and he believed that all should work for their living so every week he would leave the other of the children. Eve one week and Adam the next.


After several months of this arrangement the father fell ill. On his sick bed he spoke with his wife about the arrangement so she could take them to the store when she did his erands until he recovered.


On her first visit to the store she met the store owner who greeted her ""Ahh lovely lady, welcome! Such a shame to hear of your husband's sickness, he is such a nice man! Do you think he'll be making a recovery soon?"" She spoke with the man, left Eve at the store and continued with her day.


After several months of going to the store and being greeted with by the owner with ""Welcome back lovely lady! Do you think your husband will be making a recovery any time soon?"" She would always leave Eve at the store.


Finally their father recovered from his illness and returned to his chores. Upon entering the store for the first time in almost a year he was greeted by a joyful man clearly brimming with excitement that he had returned! ""Thank the heavens you've recovered! How's your boy been, we haven't spoken since you fell ill"". 


Furious that his wife hadn't been treating the kids fairly he stormed home to confront her. ""How many months was I ill and every single week you left Eve to do the work!"" He boomed at her. Clearly upset by these accusations she replied, ""Not once did that man ask which of the children I'd be giving him for the day, every week he'd ask the same question, give me a fowl look and usher Eve into the store to start work"". Bewildered by this revelation the father simply asked, ""Well, what did he ask you?"" She explained ""Every week he'd simply say ""Do you think your husband will recover anytime soon?"" To which I'd reply ""I don't give Adam"""". ",The real story of Adam and Eve,2

You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.

So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the ""greatest con ever botched,"" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the ""condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending"" con",A swindler passes by a bird in the stairwell of an apartment building,4

The vendor said, ""By all means, be my guest. Maybe you will run into a couple of Marines who were in here earlier saying the same thing."" 

So the Ranger headed into the bayou that same day and a few hours later came upon two men standing waist deep in the water. He thought, ""those must be the two Marines the guy in town was talking about."" Just then, the Ranger saw a tremendously long gator swimming rapidly underwater towards one of the Marines. Just as the gator was about to attack, the Marine grabbed its neck with both hands and strangled it to death with very little effort. Then both Marines dragged it on shore and flipped it on its back. Laying nearby were several more of the creatures. 

One of the Marines then exclaimed, ""Damn, this one doesn't have any shoes either!""

One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.
The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.
Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.
The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”
The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”
The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”
The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”
The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”
The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”
The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.
The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.
He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.
Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”
The man is relieved to no end.
He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.
But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",The Strange Sound,37

At closing time, as everyone came out, he spotted his potential quarry.
The man was so obviously inebriated that he could barely walk.
He stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes looking for his car.
After trying his keys on five others, he finally found his own vehicle.
He sat in the car a good 10 minutes as the other pub patrons left.
He turned his lights on, then off.
He started to pull forward into the grass, then stopped.
Finally, when his was the last car, he pulled out onto the road and started to drive away.
The cop, waiting for this, turned on his lights and pulled the man over.
He administered the breathalyzer test and, to his great surprise, the man easily passed.
The cop was dumbfounded.
'This equipment must be broken,' exclaimed the policeman.
'I doubt it,' said the man. 'Tonight I'm the DD...Designated Decoy.'
Edit: Those who think he can still get arrested.. I know it guys. Don't take it literally. Its a JOKE.
Sometimes it might actually happen, right? Just enjoy possibility. :)","Excuse me sir, how much have you had to drink tonight?",0

His Grandfather lived in a very remote, secluded, rural area of the state. After spending the night at the house, his Grandfather prepared a breakfast of eggs and bacon. As the man was eating he noticed a film like substance on the plate, and he asked, ""Grandfather, are these plates clean?""
His Grandfather replied, ""They're as clean as cold water can get 'em, so go on and finish your meal.""
Later on that day, Grandfather prepared a lunch of hamburger steak and new potatoes. As the man was eating he noticed tiny specks around the edge of his plate, and a substance that looked like dried egg yolk. Concerned about his health, he asked again, ""Grandfather, are you sure that these plates are clean?""

Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.

'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'

Says Mark: 'Now expose both breasts and let us see what happens.'

The woman exposes both breasts to the gorilla and it gets very excited and is now desperately trying to escape from the enclosure.

Says Mark: 'This is incredible, now, pull your skirt up, turn around and expose your bum and let us see what happens!'
 
The woman pulls her skirt up, turns around with her bum to the gorilla, which by now ,was extremely aroused, breaks free from the enclosure, grabs the woman and starts yanking the clothes off her.

Looking in his rear view mirror, he saw the highway patrol behind him, blue lights flashing and siren blaring.

""I can get away from him. No problem!, thought the elderly nut case as he floored it to 100 mph, then 110, then 120 mph.

Suddenly, he thought, ""What on earth am I doing? I'm too old for this nonsense!""

So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the Trooper to catch up.

Pulling in behind him, the Trooper walked up to the driver's side of the Corvette, looked at his watch and said, ""Sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes. Today is Friday. If you can give me a reason why you were speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you go.""

After they'd been driving a couple of minutes, the spooky figure of an old man suddenly appeared at the passenger window, tapping on the glass! Startled, Jake screamed, ""Joe! Joe! There's a ghost at the window!""

Joe stomped on the gas pedal, but the apparition stayed steady at the window, peering eerily into the car at the two terrified occupants, and started tapping on the glass. Scared out of his wits, Jake rolled down the window and asked, ""W-w-w-w-w-what do you want?""

The old wizened face softly whispered, ""You got any tobacco, kid?"" Trembling, Jake handed him a cigarette and yelled to Joe to step on it as he cranked up the window. The apparition vanished into the night.

A few minutes later, the two men started to calm down. nervously, Joe said, ""I don't know what happened back there, but don't worry - that thing's in the dust and we're doing over 80 now!"" Just then, came another tapping at the window, and the old man reappeared outside the window. Jake shrieked, ""There he is again!"" and nervously cracked open the window.

""Got a light, kid?"", the apparition whispered. Jake frantically threw a lighter out the window and the spectre vanished again as Jake turned to Joe and screamed, ""Haul ass, man, HAUL ASS!"" By now, they were going a hundred miles an hour, the engine screaming, with the two of them trying to forget what they'd seen... when the slow tapping at the window started up again for a third time.

""Dear lord, he's back!"" they cried in unison. Jake rolled down the window and howled in utter hysteria, ""My god, what do you want?""

post,5mjd4r,2qh72,jokes,false,1483774735,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5mjd4r/thys/,self.jokes,,"There was once a rising boy band that went by the name of *THYS*. As they began gaining popularity, they realized that they needed some help. Chris, the band's drummer, asked his girlfriend, an attractive girl named Sarah, and she agreed to be the band's manager.

All was well. With Sarah doing her job, the band was able to focus on their music, and as a result, their popularity began to grow at a new rate.

Within the band, it had quickly become an inside joke among the other members to hit on Sarah to irritate Chris. The guitarist even joked once that Sarah was a 90/10, and the nickname stuck. The other members, from then on, referred to her as ""Ninety"", and would constantly tease Chris about how they couldn't believe someone as attractive as Sarah had settled for him.

After that, Chris stopped speaking to the other band members, and suddenly, no one was seeing Ninety anymore. Chris and Ninety had moved in together a few months prior to her becoming the manager, and now, Chris had become extremely possessive and was rarely letting her leave home out of fear that she would leave him.

It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ninety wouldn't allow Chris to treat her as such, and she packed her bags and left in the middle of the night. The band members never saw them again.

Chris became very bitter. He expressed his grief by blaming the other band members for influencing ninety to leave him. Tension rose, fights broke out, and soon after, *THYS* split up for good.

Ninety had moved on. She had met someone else and settled down, living her life happily until her age matched her nickname.

When she died, her children found a heart-shaped locket among her jewelry. Inside, a crumpled note read:

Sarah,

I'm sorry for how I acted toward you. I'm not asking you to come back, because I know you won't, but I'll tell you what's been going on over here. *THYS* split up. It was going to happen sooner or later; when you left, our numbers were barely on the charts anymore. But we're done now. I don't think anyone other than you even remembers our name anymore.

Missing you,

Chris

Ninety's kids took it upon themselves to not forget, as if they were carrying on their mother's memory now that she was gone from the world.

Now, only Ninety's kids will remember *THYS*.",THYS,5

The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the bird down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old widows named Mildred and Marge.

The movie started and the rooster began to squirm. The old farmer unzipped his pants so Chucky could stick his head out and watch the movie. 

""Marge"", whispered Mildred.

""What"", said Marge.

""I think this guy next to me is a pervert."", said Mildred.

""What makes you think that"", asked Marge.

""He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out"", whispered Mildred.

They had no cell service, so they started walking. Eventually they come upon a house surrounded by fields of fruit. They knock on the front door and say to the man who answered the door. ""Hey man, our car broke down a couple miles back and it's getting late. Do you have a place for us to stay tonight?"" 

The fruit farmer replied ""Sure you can sleep in the barn, but don't even think about coming in my house and fucking my daughter."" 

The two grateful men instantly agree. I mean, how hard could it be not to sleep with someone? Just before they leave to the barn, the farmer's daughter walked downstairs. They each got a glimpse of her luscious blonde hair and long golden legs. As they walk to the barn they agree to sneak in the house during the night and tag team her.
 
The next day, the fruit farmer, who had heard the ruckus the night before said, ""Since you motherfuckers disobeyed me, I want each of you to go out into my fields and pick a hundred pieces of your favorite fruit.""
 
Confused and relieved, the two men joyfully set out to complete their tasks. The first guy came back with a hundred cherries. To his surprise he found himself staring at a double-barrelled shotgun.
 
The farmer said, ""Shove them all up your ass.""

The man said, ""Fuck no, what's wrong with you?""

The farmer pressed the barrel against the side of his head and growled, ""Cherries in your ass, or you die.""

The man reluctantly drops his pants and tenderly pops the cherry into his anus. 10 cherries and he starts to sweat. 25 cherries in and he starts to giggle. By the time he gets to 40 cherries he's laughing hysterically and shits all the cherries out. 
 
The unamused farmer gets into the laughing man's face and says, ""What's so funny gigglybits?""

 The man stops laughing just enough to choke out, ""My dumbass friend is out there picking watermelons."" ",So two guys are driving in the middle of nowhere...,11

Lucy said, ""Well, I believe in the free capitalist market, and my mother is a conservative, and my father is a conservative, so I'm a conservative too!""

Why was that gauge used?

Because a number of the early railroad lines in the US were built to fit standard-gauge locomotives manufactured by English railroad pioneer George Stephenson.  The English expatriates who immigrated to America built them to the same dimension they had built them in England.


Why did the English build them like that?

Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and thats the same gauge they used.

Why did ""they"" use the gauge for tramways then?

Because the people who built the tramwys used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which also used that wheel spacing.


OK!  Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?  

Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on the old long-distance roads in England, because that's the spacing of those wheel ruts.  If you wheel spacing didn't match the old ruts, your wheels would quickly self-destruct.


So who built those old rutted roads?

Imperial Rome built the first long-distance roads in Europe and in England for legions.  Those roads have been in use ever since.


And the ruts in the roads?

Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels.  Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, they were all made exactly alike in their wheel spacing.  Every Imperial Roman war chariot was made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two Roman war horses.  Those Roman chariots carved their deep ruts through England, Europe and the Middle East for several centuries thus establishing a well-worn precedent that has lasted for two thousand years.  Providing how much bureaucracy can last forever.


Thus the U.S. standard railroad gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot designed to accommodate the width of two equitine buttocks.

So the next time you're handed a specification and wondered what horse's ass came up with that one, perhaps you'll pause and think about just how right you might be.

An ironic addendum ot this story is that the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) used on the NASA space shuttles were manufactured by Thiokol Corp in Ogden, Utah, then shipped to Florida by rail-car for final assembly at the Cape Canaveral launch site.  The rail lines pass through several narrow railroad tunnels hand carved through the Rocky Mountains back in the 1800's.  The booster pieces thus had to be built small enough to fit through these narrow tunnel bores.  Thus our story concludes the width of one of the most advanced vehicles ever constructed by man was determined in part by the width of one of our most ancient vehicles... and a horse's ass!","Railroad tracks, a horses ass... and rockets!

""Reverend there has been a terrible misunderstanding...........

I never said you were a member of the Ku Klux Klan,

I simply told a couple of my friends that you were a wizard under the sheets.""

He starts to gently swing the watch back and forth, pinching the chain between his fingers so the watch swings freely.  By the end of his sermon, the normally lethargic members of the congregation are all sitting up straight in their seats, rapt with attention, and hanging on his every word.

Still swinging the pocketwatch, the pastor nods to his ushers, and they begin passing around the offering trays.  When the first churchgoer is handed the plate, the pastor says, ""Please give generously.""  Sure enough, everyone gave twenty or thirty or forty dollars, and at the end of the service, the ushers came in and told the pastor, ""We've brought in more money than we have in years!""

Over the next several months, the pastor continued his hypnotism during his sermon, and the church blossomed.  The church was able to reopen the community education classes that had lapsed years before for lack of funds, and provided coffee and breakfast to the homeless population on Sunday mornings.  Pleased with all the good the church was doing in the community, the pastor kept up his watch-swinging, as more and more money flowed into the church.  All he had to do was to say, ""Give,"" and the people gave.

This all worked out pretty well for a few months, until that fateful Sunday when, on the final swing of the pocketwatch, with his entire congregation watching with rapt attention, the chain slipped through the pastor's fingers, and the watch smashed into the edge of the stone pulpit, throwing gears and glass everywhere.  Looking down at the remains of his watch, the pastor grimaced and muttered, ""Shit.""

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.""

The musician stands up. “Excuse me,” he says, “but I need to practice for my concert, I hope you don’t mind.” The people sitting around him grumble an incoherent response. “Thank you,” he says. Then he bends down and whispers into his suitcase, “You guys can come out now.”

Two completely naked little people, a little man and a little woman, climb out of the suitcase. The musician looks at them and says, “90 please.” At which point the little people immediately begin to make passionate love.

“Oh my gosh!” The mother screams.

*Fwap, fwap, fwap*, comes the rhythmic sound of the little people’s lovemaking to a stunned crowd. Then the musician begins to play. His violin sings of sadness and loss, love and beauty, and by the time the song is over nearly everyone has tears in their eyes.

For a moment, there is complete silence. Then thunderous applause fills the train.

The mother and daughter approach the musician. “That was incredible,” the mother says, “but…do you need the midgets having sex? There are children here!”

chorus were rehearsing Symphony No. 9 by Ludwig Von Beethoven. Since
the chorus doesn't enter until the final movement, the singers were 
becoming very bored - especially the men in the back row. Then the 
basses had a clever idea. During break, they tied a nylon fish-line 
around the conductor's score, 4 pages prior to the beginning of the
last movement. They ran the line up through a roof vent, across the
street and down into Joe's tavern. This allowed them to relax at the
bar chugging brews, and when the line jerked, they could run across
the street and take their places in the chorus at the precise time.
  Their plan worked flawlessly, especially when the conductor paused
before continuing, to have the trombones, who were playing somewhat 
flat, tune their instruments. So all singers were in readiness as 
the conductor raised his baton.
  Well.....almost all... except for two men who had earlier passed
out at the bar.
  And so this became the first case in musical history where it was
the bottom of the ninth, the basses were loaded, the score was tied,
there were two out, the lead-off man was up and the inside pitch 
was low. ",The municipal philharmonic symphony and chorus were rehearsing....,53
