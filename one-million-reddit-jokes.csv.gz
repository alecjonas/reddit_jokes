By this time the judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule, Bessie.""

Clyde thanked the judge and proceeded.

""Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

When the highway patrolman came on the scene he could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her and saw her near fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.

The head monk sadly inform him that they do not have the key ingredient, and that due to a religious vow they took, they cannot leave the monastery. Luckily, they tell him that if he can get the key ingredient, a rare plant called the jit, they can cook it.

Encouraged, the man sets out on the journey of a lifetime, determined to find the jit plant. He searches everywhere, the darkest caves, the deepest oceans and the highest mountains. Eventually, years later he finds a small shop hidden in an alleyway of a tiny town that sells the jit plant. 

With the key ingredient on him, he sets back off to the Buddhist monastery ready to try the dish that the wealthy and elite live.

When he gets there, he gives the head monk the plant and bows. The monk bows back and heads off to prepare the dish. An hour later the monk returns with a small ornate pie, decorated with pastry swirls. He gives it to the man and steps back to watch the mans reaction.

The man eagerly takes a bite but is horrified when it tastes like shit. Disgusted, he asked the monk why it tastes so bad.

Thursday comes and the man heads home early already boiling with rage at the thought of his wife with another man. He takes the stairs, all 9 flights, to cool his wrath. He kicks the door in and yells ""where is he, Bitch, I know you've got some other guy here!"" His wife immediately berates him for his lack of trust as he searches the apartment for any sign of the man. He looks everywhere, in the shower, the closet, under the bed and can find nothing... Feeling like an ass and doubting himself with his wife still in his ear, he walks out on the balcony. 
With his head in his hands he tries to think of where we went wrong and then he sees it, fingers hanging on the edge of the balcony. Rage rekindled, he runs over with a voice out of hell yelling I'm murderous rage at the man dangling from the balcony. His wife at his back pleading for him to stop, he crushes the man's fingers under his boot and the man falls 9 floors but the shrubs break his fall and he survives! 
Seeing the man's movement below, the enraged husband runs into the house and beings to push his refrigerator off the balcony, the fridge falls on the man and kills him but the husband falls off the balcony too and also dies...
They are waiting in a long line to enter heaven and at last they reach the front. St. Peter asks ""what's your story"". The dangling man says. ""I live on the 10th floor of this apartment building, I was exercising on the balcony and I got dizzy and fell off but luckily I grabbed the balcony right below me! I'm hanging there and this crazy guy comes and crushes my fingers so I fall and land in the bushes but I'm still not dead... Then this wacko throws his fridge on me and I die! The rage husband tells his story. ""well I thought my wife was cheating on me and one day I came home and was very angry... I... I was out on the balcony and I tried to make it right... I guess I fell and died... The last guy is asked of his story and says....""So get this shit... I was hiding naked in this chick's refrigerator right...""

Thanks for sticking through to the end! ",[Long] A man suspects his wife has been cheating on him...,2

So what's your story?""

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.""

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. ""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. ""Picture this,"" says the third man, ""I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator...""

Most people had around a 50% power percentage, parents would give some of their belongings to their kids at birth so they would be strong enough to walk, but people who went above that 50%, would have extreme strength, and people would often compete to see who could have the most, but no one had ever gotten to 100% power percentage.

So there was this guy named Lort Bumblethorn, and he was renowned for getting to 99% power percentage, but he got in some financial trouble, sold a house, and went back to around 95%, never reaching back to his record.

Eventually, Lort settled down, and had two kids, the youngest named Sort. Sort was inspired by his father, and believed he could reach 100% power percentage. He had massive success in his career, getting to 90% power, but sadly, his father passed away, which demoralized Sort.

One day, as it looked as if his dream was basically gone, he was in a shop, when an old man approached him, ""Excuse me, are you Lort Bumblethorn?""

""No,"" replied Sort, ""I'm Sort, his son. No autographs please.""

""No, no, I was a good friend of your fathers"", he reached into his pocket and pulled out a bronze rod, ""this was what your father was trying to use to get to 100% power, he gave it to me for safekeeping, it can only be used by a Bumblethorn, it is called the Kneeoo, and it will get you to 100% power. I'll sell it to you for only $10.00""

""That's a nice story, but I know you're a scammer, get out of my presence.""

""No,"" pleaded the old man, ""please.""

Suddenly, there was a shimmer of light behind Sort, he turned around, and there was an apparition of his father, the one, the only, Lort Bumblethorn, and he spoke out to his son.

""**Sort, buy Kneeoo, it will make your PP very big.""**",So there was this society where everybody was born really weak.,8

Joe practices some golf but he is a little wasted and he isn't keeping track of his score.

Joe continues to play and drink, and once again forgets where he is at so he asks the same lady again what hole he's at to which she replies: ""I am still one hole ahead of you, I'm at the 16th so you are on the 15th""

Joe proceeds to finish his game and goes to have another drink at the terrain's club. He sees the lady once again and they start chatting, he asks her what she does for a living, but she declines to answer because she is afraid Joe will laugh at her, but Joe reassures her and promises he won't laugh...

""Alright"" she says, ""If you must know, I work in a tampon factory"" and Joe is barely able to resist 2 seconds before he bursts out laughing like a man possessed, which prompts the lady to turn her back away leaving in a hurry but Joe catches up to her and says: ""I am really sorry madam, but I work in a toilet paper factory so technically you are still one hole ahead of me!""",Golf holes.,14

Tearfully, she explained, ""It's the druggist.. He insulted me terribly this morning on the phone. I had to call multiple times before he would even answer the phone.""
Immediately, the husband drove downtown to confront the druggist and demand an apology. 

Before he could say more than a word or two, the druggist told him, ""Now, just a minute, listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm failed to go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, just to realize that I locked the house with both house and car keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Later, when I was about three blocks from the store, I had a flat tire. When I finally got to the store, a bunch of people were waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook.""

He continued, ""Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I had to get down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels, and the phone was still ringing. When I came up, I cracked my head on the open register. Meanwhile, the phone is still ringing with no letup, and I finally got back to answer it. 
It was your wife. She wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer and believe me mister, as God is my witness ... ALL I DID WAS TELL HER!""",The Pharmacist and a Thermometer,39

The only building within miles was a monestary. He walked up the steps, knocked on the huge wooden doors, and explained his situation to the monks. The monks were more than helpful. They sent a message to the nearest road station, though they informed him it would take a day to reach it's destination. However, they kindly offered the man a room and food for the time being.

At night, while he was sleeping, the man was awoken by a sweet and mystical sound from deep within the monestary. He laid awake for some time, pondering the source of this noise. The next day, as his car was being hooked up, he asked the monks what had made the noise, but they said;

""*We cannot tell you, for you are not a monk*""

The man left the monestary, with the noise plaguing his thoughts. Eventually, it became his obsession, and he drove back to the monestary to demand to know what made that sultry noise. But the monks denied him again;

""*We cannot tell you, for you are not a monk*""


""Then how do I become a monk?""

The monks, amazed by this man's persistence, told him he must travel the world and know the total number of grains of sand, blades of grass, and flakes of snow that exist on the earth. So the man set off on his quest.

50 years later, the man returned.

""There are 4,897,985,234,543 grains of sand, 8,534,123,758,973 blades of grass, and 976,042,026,647 flakes of snow on the earth.""

The monks nodded, and lead him to a wooden door in the basement.

""*This key unlocks that door*"" one said, pointing at the wooden door. ""*Behind it is what you seek*""

The man turned the lock, opened the door, and saw another door, this one made of steel. 

""Very funny, gimme the key to this door""

The monks abliged, and gave him the key. Behind the steel door was a bronze door. And behind that door was a silver door. Then a gold door, an emerald door, a platinum door, and finally, a diamond door. After finally opening the diamond door, the man gazed upon the wonder that made the noise which became his obsession. He cried for joy and and praise the almighty heavens.....

But he couldn't tell you what is was, for you are not a monk.",Once upon a time...,8

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

On the anniversary of creating his thousandth copy of the bible since he first joined the monastery two decades ago, brother Gray asks the abbot if he could go and make his next copy using the original in the vault as reference material. Since they've just been making copies of a copy for centuries and given his dedication to the process and his work so far the abbot agrees and brother Gray descends into the vault where he is given access to the only existing and oldest copy of the bible they have.

&amp;#x200B;

Days pass, none of the other monks are particularly concerned as brother Gray was known to be a perfectionist and was recognized among them as one of the best in his craft. After another week though they become anxious as nobody had really seen him since his descent into the vault, as such the abbot takes it upon himself to check up on him.

&amp;#x200B;

As he nears the vault he hears a gutteral sobbing, relentless and distraught. The abbot pushes open the door to the vault to find brother Gray lying face down in a heap on the floor, pages of the bible scattered all around. He rushes to his side. ""Brother, whatever is the matter? We've been so worried about you. What's wrong?"".

&amp;#x200B;

 Brother Gray pushes himself upright, wipes away the tears from his eyes and grabs the abbot by the collar. ""The word was 'Celebrate'""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave.,8

It came to the point that the city only had a single tree left.

Anyway, the man's toothache was not getting any better so he sought the best dentist in the city. Unluckily for him, the only dentist in the city was Doctor Water, who has a notoriety for using quack methods with his patients. They work sometimes, but are often downright useless. Since his toothache was unbearable, he had to take his chance.

He went to Doctor Water's clinic and asked for his advice. At that point you really have a 50/50 chance of getting a miraculous solution or straight up trickery. Doctor Water looked through his hundreds of files and found that the best treatment for a toothache would be to chew on a piece of gum tree. Coincidentally enough, there happens to be a gum tree growing near Water's office - the last tree in the city. The man left the clinic skeptical but desperate, and headed straight to the tree.

Once he was next to the tree, he looked around to make sure that no one was watching, and sunk his teeth into the bark. He tried to bite a piece off, but his teeth hurt to much to do so. Instead, he pulled out a knife and tried to carve a piece out, but knocked the entire tree over.

Nonetheless, he got a piece of the tree and started to chew on it. He walked his way home still chewing on it, hopped on his couch and watched the news. He quickly recognised his own face on the television, realising that the tree he just knocked over was the final tree in the city. That being said, his toothache still didn't go away.

For whatever reason, they want to see who can throw a brick the highest, to see this, they decide to each throw a brick up and see how far it sinks into the mud. The first guy throws, sinks 3 feet into the mud. The second guy says, 
""I can beat that"", and throws the brick and it sinks 5 feet into the mud. Then the third guy, takes his brick, winds up, throws it, and it doesn't come down. 
Next joke. 
This woman wants to go see her mother, and is booking a flight to go see her. The problem is, she wants to take her parrot with her on the flight, and the only one she can book is a no birds, and no smoking flight. She books the flight and decides to bring the parrot with, hiding it inside her coat, and boards the plane some time later. During the flight, the pilot gets up and begins asking the passengers about their flight and if he can get them anything, while he has a giant cigar in his mouth. When the pilot gets to the woman, he asks her the stuff he's been asking the other passengers, until he hears a faint,
 ""Polly want a cracker?"",
Then, the pilot asks, 
""Did I just hear a bird, on MY plane?""
Fearing for the life of her bird, she says
""It was probably nothing.""
Then a second ""Polly want a cracker?"", louder this time. 
""You have a bird on this NO bird flight, don't you?"", he then tears the womans jacket off, revealing the bird hiding, sitting on the woman's shirt. He then promptly takes the bird and throws it out the window (don't ask why there are open able windows on a plane). 
""you're not allowed to have birds on this flight!"" he yells. 
Then, the women takes the pots cigar, and throws it out the window, screaming ""Well, you're not allowed to have THIS on the plane"", throwing the cigar out the window. After the conundrum, the pilot returns to the cockpit, and then sees the parrot, sitting on the front if the plane, holding  something in its beak. What is it holding? The cigar? No, the brick.

She said, ""I have a praise.

Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""

(You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced.)

""Tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain.""

We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place.""

(Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom.)

""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

(All the men sighed with unified relief.)

The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

A man slowly stood up and walked just as slowly to the podium.

He said, ""I'm Tom Smith."" The entire congregation held its breath.

With a guaranteed large audience, they agreed upon setting the spectator fee of $50 for anyone watching. Plus, the extra benefit is that we can guarantee more people going to hell.
The rules are simple: All contestants will prove their amount of greed by means of debate, action, or providing evidence of their greed. The winner will be the one that exhibits the most greed, and will get a share of the fee charged to the audience.

So, having posted the contest, the only thing left was to wait for contestants and an audience. Slowly, but surely, a crowd gathered. The contestants made sure to make an entrance: Trump flying in on his Air Force One, Kim Jong-Un showing up with his parade of ~~slaves~~ cheerleaders, Joel Osteen with his giant crowd of followers, and many others.

What a spectacle! Kim Jong-Un burned a giant pile of cash and proclaimed that countless people in his country could have lived off that, but f--- them. Justin Bieber grabbed dozens of his fans purses, dumped them out, poured vodka all the contents and burned them. Trump went on and on about how he has done so much for America, then said he's a savior to the world and we need to build a wall around his new estate.

This went on for quite some time. Some of the contestants bowed their heads in shame and left as they couldn't compete. With all of these greedy people, who could win? But then, out of NOWHERE, a competitor comes in and wipes the floor clean with the amount of greed they had in them. Press F to pay $50 in order to unlock the rest of the joke.",Who is the Greediest?

Eager to show him his discovery, he pulls out the cork and sure enough the ass begins to sing.

""On the road again, Going places that I've never been.""

Jack looked over at the head coroner's nonplussed face. And the head coroner sighs and says

People from all around his village would come everyday to witness this themselves.They would bring a bowl or a plate from their home and return with it being full of delicious food. Whenever anyone came up to him with a bowl, he would just proudly say ""Ready the bowl, Mam !""and in a puff of smoke that bowl would be full of whatever that person desired to eat.He could make sweets , he could make beverages , he could make anything the heart desired, and he helped everyone with his gift.

Because of this helpful nature he was beloved by everyone in the village. All the girls liked him and all the boys wanted to be friends with him. Except for one who one day out of jealousy ran to the king and told him everything about Al and his powers because he wished for Al to be captured by him, And the greedy king took the bait and sent his soldiers to capture Al by any means necessary. But Al was warned beforehand by a well-wisher of him at the court whom Al had helped once.So he ran away from the village, from everything he knew. His family, His friends, His life.He ran until he could run no longer and he slipped and collapsed.

When he opened his eyes the next time he saw that he was in some sort of a hut with an old guy tending to his wounds. Startled he immediately tried to flee, but the old man reassured him that no harm would come his way there. He told him that he was a woodcutter, He made a meagre income to sustain himself and his livestock. After feeling reassured Al decided that he is going to live here now and help the old man. He said to the old man the he doesn't need to do work anymore now that he's here. He asked the old man to bring him a plate or a bowl. The puzzled old man brought him a plate and a glass. Al took the plate and with a proud smile he said ""ready the plate, Sir!"" and Poof!, The plate was filled with delicious roasted chicken and herb-basted potatoes with the glass filled with the finest beer in the whole kingdom. Dumbstruck the Old man after tasting the food a bit merrily ate the most delicious meal of his life.

After that beautiful meal the old man thanked Al but told him that it's not that he HAS to chop wood. It's just a part of his life and that he loves going to the market and meeting people there. Al confided and decided to go with the old man to the market everyday, because if he wished to live a normal life, he was going to need to learn some basic skills. So the old man took Al as his apprentice and taught him everything that he knew. He found joy in the young boy trying to learn his craft and was happy with his dedication to working.

Slowly as time passed on that young boy became a young adult, with the old man now confined to his hut due to his health. Al took care of everything now, He would make him soup and chop wood to buy medicine from the local apothecary. But as slowly more time passed it became evident that the old man was nearing his end. One day when Al returned from the market he saw the old man lying on the bed, Al quickly rushed to his side where the old man put his hand on Al and told him how much he loved him, about how he was like his son he never had, with tears in his eyes , Al thanked the old man for saving him and as he was thanking he felt the hand of the old man slowly slipping from his shoulders, with the last words by him being about forgiveness and compassion, with Al now again after all these years left without a family. He arranged a proper burial of the old man in the woods where he just sat near his grave thinking what he was going to do next. After all this time he finally had time again to think about his old life his family, his friendss, his old village. He decided to go visit his old village, assured that nobody should be able to recognize him after all these years. He knew that the old greedy king was no more and thus he was able to easily reach his village.

Upon reaching he saw that the village he once knew was no longer there. In it's place was a dilapidated town where everything was dark even the people everyone was mean to everyone else. Nobody laughed or played anymore. As he reached the townsquare he saw a man alone on a stage speaking to the 10-15 people who were there. As Al walked closer to hear what was being said, He was shocked. The person there spoke of Al, about how he had wronged Al when they were just kids, about how Al was the life of the village , about how he was sorry for doing all this to him and about how he has been speaking at that very spot there for years trying to remind the people of that town of the good in their hearts. After hearing all this Al recognised that man to be the kid that wronged him and he started to get angry but then he saw the man take a tray from his pouch and show it to everyone and then shouted,

""Al ! If you are here, know that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything that I did to you. If you could find it in your heart please forgive the man that stands in front of you and fill this tray and this town with your magic. Make this town remember its roots again""

After hearing all this Al was fuming with anger.

How could he ? How could he expect forgiveness after ruining his life. Feeling almost disgusted he started to leave but then he remembered the old mans words. He thought about all the good times he has had with him, and he remembered his message about forgiveness and compassion. After a minute of standing still he slowly started making his way towards the stage until he was standing in front of the crowd. The man on the stage a little surprised asked Al

""Who are you ?""

Tearing up he stepped forth , took the tray and with the same proud feeling that he once felt ,smiling gleefully,screamed at the top of his lungs,

""I'm Al, Ready Tray, Sir ! """,There was once a boy named Al who had special magical powers.,161

Margaret tells her ""I'm going to use my underwear and toss them away after, they're my cheap ones so I don't care!""

Mary has a think about it, but she is wearing her best Victoria's Secret panties and doesn't really want to throw them away, so after a lot of debate she very regrettably decides to wipe herself with a wreath from a nearby grave, and then the two continue home.

The following day, their husbands are sitting in the bar. One tells the other ""hey bud, I don't think we should let our wives go out together any more. Margaret came home last night with no panties on""

He was always a mess and often would drink to the point of vomiting. On nights like this he’d come home and his wife would scream at him for showing up drunk and disgusting.  It was weighing on him and he knew his wife would leave him soon if he kept showing up like this, but he just couldn’t kick the sauce...

So one day he was day-drinking at a bar, telling his sob story to the bartender, who told him: 

“Look, if you ever get vomit on yourself, just put $20 in your shirt pocket and when you get home tell your wife that some drunk idiot threw up on you, apologized, and then gave you money for dry-cleaning.”

This was a brilliant idea, Terry had a new lease on life. He proceeded to get terribly drunk, he was falling down, stumbling around, and finally it happened. He threw up and got a bunch of it all over his shirt. He waited it out a little and sobered up just enough to speak coherently and went home, sticking to his plan. 

Terry finally gets home, his wife is pissed:

“Terry! You bastard! I’m sick of this, I don’t know if I can take any more of this. You come home drunk and smell like shit and I don’t want to deal with it any longer!” 

He could see the look in her eyes, he could tell that the woman who he married and loved was disgusted with him. She was going to leave, he had to stop her, and he had an ace up his sleeve. 

“Babe! It’s not like that I swear! This old drunk idiot threw up on me at the bar. It was disgusting! But, he felt terrible and gave me $20 to clean my shirt. See? It’s ok.”

""Sell cookies!""

So Carmen and Kate went house to house in their town and made $75, but they wanted more

They decided to drive around the country in their cars, going house to house in every town

They came to a barn 

They knocked on the door and made some money

It was getting stormy and the farmer let them stay the night.

When they got inside, there was a huge pie on the table and they were starving

""Dont touch that! My mom needs that for a party tommorow"", the farmer said.

The farmer let Carmen and Kate stay in the attic for the night

""Kate, I need to get a slice of the pie!"", Carmen said.

So she snuck down stairs, grabbed a knife and cut a piece of the pie

Suddenly, the door flew open and she ducked under the table

""Who's there?!?"", said the farmer, with a shotgun in his hand

Carmen panicked and said ""Meow!""

It worked, since the farmer thought it was a cat

The door shut and Carmen ran upstairs

Carmen told Kate what she did, and Kate wanted to grab a piece

Kate snuck downstairs and took the knife. She slowly cut the piece.

Suddenly, the door flew wide open and Kate ducked under the table

""Who's there?!?"", said the farmer, with his shotgun.

Kate remembered what Carmen did

The next morning she hears a knock at the door, its the same man and he asks the same question to the woman, ""Do you have a Vagina?"" She slams the door again. 

Later that night when her husband gets home she tell him what has happened for the last two days. The husband tells his wife in a loving and concerned voice, ""Honey, I am taking an off tomorrow so as to be home, just incase this guy shows up again."" 

The next morning they hear a knock at the door and both ran for the door.  The husband whisperes to the wife, ""Honey, im going to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the question because I want to a see where he's going with this."" She nods yes to her husband and opens the door. 

Sure enough the same fellow is standing there, he asks, ""Do you have a Vagina?"" ""Yes I do."" says the lady. 

The man replies, ""Good, would you mind telling your husband to leave my wife's alone and start using yours!""

He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador Retriever sitting there.

""You talk?"" he asks.

""Yep"" the Lab replies.

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says, ""So, what's your story?""

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping, I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running... but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

""Ten dollars"" the guy says.

""Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on Earth are you selling him so cheap?""

""Because he's a liar. He's never been out of the yard.""",Talking Dog For Sale,17

After a short conversation with the head mistress, she knew just the woman to fill his needs. “We have any type of girl you could ever want here, but I know who you would love. We call her Hurricane Lulu.”

Intrigued, he asks about her. What she looks like, what she specializes in and most of all. Why they call her Hurricane Lulu?

The head mistress says that he has to wait to find out, and she was waiting for him in the room at the very end of the hallway. 

So he walks back and through the door into a dimly lit room, and a voice says from the bathroom to make himself comfortable, and that she would be out soon. 

When she comes out she’s a very tall woman with huge breasts, wearing nothing but a grass skirt, and before he even has time to be excited she takes off running across the room and jumps through the air and lands on top of him, and starts blowing and whistling in his face as hard as she can. 

Confused the man ask “umm excuse me miss.. what’s are you doing?” “Those are the winds of a hurricane!” She says. Before he has time to respond she rears back and starts hitting him in the face with her huge breasts. 

He gets away from her long enough to yell “what are you doing now!?” “Oh honey.. those are the coconuts falling from the trees hitting you from the strong winds of the hurricane!” She says.

By now he’s getting frustrated, but before he can say anything else she gets up on all fours and starts pissing all over him! 

He runs to the other side of the room and she says “and that’s the warm rain from the hurricane!”

So he starts putting his clothes on, and gathering up his things. Lulu says “Wait! Where are you going!?” 

And as he’s walking out he says. “I’m leaving! Who the hell can fuck in this kinda weather!?”",A man went into a brothel...,9

While eating, they hear the husband coming! The wife, thinking quickly, puts them inside three sacks on the wall that were supposed to contain the giant’s food.

The husband bursts through the door, insisting he smells tasty dwarves. The wife quickly denies it, but he is still suspicious, so he searches the house. He finally gets to the three sacks on the wall, and kicks the first.

“Moooooo!” The first dwarf cries, convincing the giant a cow is inside. He then kicks the second sack.

“Baaaaaa!” The second dwarf cries, convincing the giant a sheep is inside.
He then turns to the third sack and kicks it.

“I’ll buy it” The businessman replies immediately, writing him a cheque, taking the lamp and leaving before the old man can change his mind.

""1:30am, fuck. I need to go home now or my wife's going to ripp my balls off"" - Thinks to himself.

But as he's trying to get up, he falls awkwardly to the floor.

""I'm just way too drunk right now, I need to sober up""

So he asks the barman for a coffe, he drinks it up and 30 minutes later he tries to stand up, but again, falling to the floor, this time, even harder.

At this point he realizes he needs to get home no matter what, so he starts crawling towards his house. After 40 minutes he gets there, lays down next to his (asleep) wife and passes out.

The next morning his wife wakes him up and starts shouting at him:

-So... how was last night, huh? Was it fun drinking all day?

The man is 100% sure his wife was asleep when he got home so he tries to play it cool:

-Not really, just hanging with some coworkers... we didn't drink much... just a couple of beers.

The woman starts nodding sarcastically and responds:

-The bar owner called this morning, your wheelchair's there, you dumbfuck.",A man has been drinking alone all day at a bar...,23231
