The boy grew up, with his toy tractors and always wanted more. A toy tractor for christmas, a toy tractor for new years, a toy tractor every time he opened the door.

You could call the boy a tractor fan. Not a fan that's a tractor but a fan of tractors, a fan that would love tractors for his entire life span.

But as he grew up he had to let go of his tractor fandom. Because he needed a job to work on his own, get a girlfriend and look handsome.

So he let go of his fandom and was no longer a fan of his tractors. And soon, in his life, tractors were no longer big factors.

So one night he went out with his colleagues to the bar they always went to. Only this night was different, on the bar, sat somebody new.

A woman so beautiful, so elegant, he had to fall in love with her. This was the girlfriend he was looking for, the girl he dreamed about for sure!

He saunters over toward the girl in the smokey room and asks ""How's it going?"". The girl looks flustered and says ""It's a little smokey in here..."", red faced, she was literally glowing.

So he said unto her, ""Don't worry maam, I'll sort out this stuff"", and sucked all the smoke in the room up with one big huff.

He walked outside, blew the smoke out; and walked back in and stood next to her, with a proud little pout.

Amazed, she asked ""How did you do that?"", pointing to his mouth with her hand.

And he said ""Well my dear, it's not too hard, being an ex-tractor fan.""",A boy and his tractors,0

Nick the Dragon slayer knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them.

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, who was the King's chief doctor.
Horatio the Physician, exclaimed that he could arrange for Nick the Dragon Slayer to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1, 000 gold coins to arrange it.

Without pause, Nick the Dragon Slayer readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio the Physician made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's brassiere while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio the Physician informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick the Dragon Slayer would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King quickly summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer. Horatio the Physician then slipped Nick the Dragon Slayer the antidote for the itching powder, which he quickly put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's voluptuous and magnificent breasts.

The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick the Dragon Slayer left satisfied and touted as a hero.
Upon returning to his chamber, Nick the Dragon Slayer found Horatio the Physician demanding his payment of thousand gold coins.

With his obsession now satisfied, Nick the Dragon Slayer couldn't have cared less and, knowing that Horatio the Physician could never report this matter to the King, with a laugh just told him to get lost.
The next day, Horatio the Physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer...

Jim turns to Bob and says, ""You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education.

Tomorrow I think I'll go to the Community College and sign up for some classes.""

Bob thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave. The next day, Jim goes down to the college

and meets Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English,History, and Logic.

""Logic?"" Jim says. ""What's that?""

The dean says, ""I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?""

""Yeah."" ""Then logically speaking, because you own a weed eater, I think that you would have a yard.""

""That's true, I do have a yard.""

""I'm not done,"" the dean says. ""Because you have a yard, I think logically that you would have a house.""

""Yes, I do have a house.""

""And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family.""

""Yes, I have a family.""

""I'm not done yet. Because you have a family, then logically you must have a wife. And because you have a wife, then logic tells me you must be a heterosexual.""

""I am a heterosexual. That's amazing, you were able to find out all of that because I have a weed eater.""

There was two unexpected standing challengers:

An Irish priest and an Australian farmer.

Grand jury began final round televised live to every corner of the planet: Questions from all areas of expertise known to man constructed by the sharpest minds mankind could offer...
But yet another surprise. All certified and approved questions had been answered with no hint of hesitation from neither of contenders...
After a short caucus Grand Jury decided that both competitors had to write an improvised short poem. Better writer wins the contest and becomes a legend. However.. poem had to contain a distant city's name 'Timbuktu' to avoid copycatting.

After a short while an Irish priest confidently steps forward and begins with well trained melodic soothing recitation:

'I am a father near all my life

Though I have no children and I have no wife

But I read a bible through and through

On my blessed road to Timbuktu'

Standing ovation. Organisers with tears in their eyes step forward to proclaim winner. But Australian farmer slowly approaches the microphone. Billions hold their breaths in their homes, apartments, pubs, stadiums, caves, space stations, you get the idea...

There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

&amp;nbsp;

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

&amp;nbsp;

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

&amp;nbsp;

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

&amp;nbsp;

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

&amp;nbsp;

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

&amp;nbsp;

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

&amp;nbsp;

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

&amp;nbsp;

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

&amp;nbsp;

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

&amp;nbsp;

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

&amp;nbsp;

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

&amp;nbsp;

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

&amp;nbsp;

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes.,2

She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me.""

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""

If you looked hard enough, you could see that there were cracks all over the walls, from previous failed attempts at escape. The hope to escape had long fled the hearts of those surrounding Fue, but he was special, he was a survivor. Fue was a brilliant boy, and studied mechanical engineering his whole life, so that one day he could taste the sweetness of victory. Fue was able to feed his insatiable desire to escape by working in the scrapyard near his small hut in the encampment. He spent years on a secret project that he knew would one day lead him to freedom. After 10 years of hard work, Fue lancaster finished his project, a remarkable, and heavily armed jet fighter. He proudly looked upon his creation and decided he should name it after himself. It wasn't long after that fue took flight, and headed towards the wall. With the press of a small red button, the roaring of the flight engines on the missiles could be heard for miles. With the loudest boom fue  had ever heard, he saw the wall crumble. He felt a new sensation in his face and realized that he was smiling for the first time. That smile soon faded when fue realized that the center of the wall was made of solid steel! With a mighty yawp, fue blasted roaring flames at the treacherous metal keeping him from his one desire of freedom. His yell did not stop until there was no more fire left. His heart raced as he waited for the smoke to clear.

""I served you 10 years and you do this..?

Please give me 10 days before you throw me in with those dogs!""
So the king agreed… 

In those 10 days the minister went to the guard that was guarding the dogs and told him he wants to serve the dogs for the next 10 days… 

The guard was baffled… 
But he agreed… 
So the minister started feeding the dogs, cleaning them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort to them.

When the 10 days were up… 

The king ordered that the minister be thrown in to the dogs as his punishment. 

But when he was thrown in, 

Everyone was amazed at what they saw..
They saw the dogs licking the feet of the minister!

So the king, baffled at what he saw, said:” what happened to my dogs. !!!”

Tony Blair thinks for a moment and responds ""Well it would be me""

""Correct. Thank you very much Tony"" says the queen.

Bush says ""Ahh, you know, that's real clever, I might have to try that on some of my cabinet members. Thank you very much""

Bush is now back home in the U.S and calls Donald Rumsfeld to his office.

""Donald, I have a question for you. If your mother has a child and your father has a child and it's not your brother or sister, who is it?""

Donald thinks long and hard and says ""You know George, I'm not sure, but I'll give you an answer by tomorrow""

Bush agrees and lets Donald go.

Donald then gathers up the cabinet and asks them the question. Nobody knows the answer, and after many failed attempts somone speaks up and says ""I know! lets ask Colin Powell! He's a smart man, he should know"". So they call up Colin Powell.

They ask him, ""Colin, we have an important question for you... if your mother has a child and your father has a child and it's not your brother or sister, who is it?""

""You bunch of morons, it would be myself!"" says Colin Powell.

""Ahhh!! We get it now!"" says the members of the cabinet.

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. 

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.

 So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time she attempted the step, and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. 

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!' The Texan smiled and drawled, ""Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we are friends.""",A girl with tight skirt tries to get on a bus....,5623

post,3q3hns,2qh72,jokes,false,1445733939,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3q3hns/the_bell_ringer/,self.jokes,,"A priest stands alone in his church. It is a beautiful old church with a great tall bell tower. Suddenly, the front doors of the church open and a hobbled old man walks in. He is barely able to walk and his back is so hunched he can barely look up at the priest. The old man walks up to the priest and says;

""Father, please help me. I am an old, tired, and feeble man. All I want is a purpose and a bed to sleep in. Is there anything I can do for your church? Any way I can be of some help to someone?""

The priest looked down at the sad old man with pity in his heart and said;

""My son, it grieves me to see one of God's children in such a state. Of course you are welcome to stay here, but you need not work to earn your keep.""

To which the old man replied;

""But Father, I seek a job, a purpose, something to give my remaining time some meaning.""

The priest thought, then said;

""Well, it's not much, but we do need a new bell ringer, though I fear it may be to strenuous a task for you.""

The old man said;

""I'll do it. Please just give me a chance.""

So the priest lead the old man to the top if the bell tower, showed him how to pull the ropes to ring the gigantic bells, and showed him the bed for him there in the tower.

""You can stay here. We will bring you food everyday and all you must do is ring the bell every hour, on the hour, the appropriate number of times,"" The priest said.

The old man thanked him and the priest returned down stairs.

As the first hour drew near, the priest began to worry. He thought of the man's hunched back and his twisted arms, and began to doubt the man would be able to ring the huge bell. But sure enough, when the hour came, the bell rang loudly and clearly and the appropriate number of times.

For the next few days, the priest worries lessened as the bell continued to ring perfectly every time.

One night, as the priest sat reading in his study, he began to be curious about how the broken old man was doing it. He had been so sure the man's wilted body would not be capable of exerting the effort required to ring the great bell.

So, near the hour of 9, he quietly went up the tower to watch. As the time grew near, he watched the man get up from his bed and stand facing the bell at a few paces. The man checked the clock and when the hour hit 9 exactly he charged face first into the bell, creating a resonant, clear ring. The man repeated this eight more times, ringing the bell with his own face each time.

The priest watched in horror, but when the old man finished and turn back to his bed, among the bruises and cuts on the man's face, there was a giant smile. He was so happy to have a purpose and home that he almost didn't feel the pain.

The priest returned downstairs, worried, but unsure what to do. He decided that he would let the man continue, but he would make sure to check on him more often.

Finally, Sunday came and the church was full of people. The priest gave his sermon and listened as the bell rang proudly in the middle of it. An hour after that, during a hymn, the bell began to ring again, but, unlike any time before it, the bell stopped two rings short of the proper number.

The priest was worried by this, but was unable to stop the service, and knew it would be over soon. 

After the service, he was heading for the base of the tower when he heard a great deal of noise coming from outside. He was worried about the old man, but felt he needed to check outside first.

When he got outside, he saw a huge crowd of people near the base of the tower, all focused on something on the ground in the middle of the group. He quickly made his way through the crowd to the middle, only to find the broken body of the old man lying there in a heap.

The priest assumed the man, in one of his mad charges at the bell, had missed and tumbled from the tower to the ground below.

""Father, did you know this man?"" someone asked.

""No"" said the priest, ""but his face rings a bell.""",The Bell Ringer,132

He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong. Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: ""Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian"" He stumbles into the kitchen and sure enough, there is a hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee, and the morning newspaper all waiting for him.

His son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, ""Son… what happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after three in the morning, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you threw-up in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""

Confused, he asked his son, "" So, why is your mother in such a good mood, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?""

His son replies, ""Oh THAT! Well, when Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone, I'm married! I'm married!'""

Middle son (MS): Short guy? He must be from the next village.

So the sons go to the next village and beat the shit out of Jimmy. Naturally, he takes the matter to the local court.

The judge asks the sons why the thought it was Jimmy.

OS: Well, our father told us that some asshole stole our cow, and if he's an asshole, he must be short.

MS: If he's short, he must be from the next village.

YS: If he's from the next village, he must be Jimmy.

Judge: Hmmm, that's some interesting logic there - I wonder if it's valid. You there, bring me the box sitting over there. Now boys, can you deduce what's inside?

OS: The box is square.

MS: If it's square, what's inside must be round.

YS: If it's round, it must be an orange.

Dear Vincent,
I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over.. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.

Dear Pop,
Don’t dig up that garden. That’s where the bodies are buried.

One of them suggested the nearby cemetery.

As they were jumping over the gate to enter the cemetery, two oranges fell out of the big bag but they didn't bother to pick them up.

A few minutes later, a drunkard on his way from a bar passed near the cemetery gate and heard a voice saying: 

""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you...""

He immediately sobered up and ran as fast as he could to a nearby Church to get the Priest.

""Father, please come with me."" He said. ""Come and witness God and Satan sharing corpses at the cemetery""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate and the voice continued: 

""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate &amp; the voice continued: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

The Priest, white in his face, whispered to the drunkard.

Suddenly, the voice stopped counting and asked a question.

The bartender takes one look at him and says, 'Okay, man, I just have to know. I'll shout you a beer if you tell me just how your head came to be half an orange.' The man sits down at the bar and says, 'Well, it happened like this.'

'I'm walking along the beach one day when I find a mysterious bottle lying in the sand. I pick it up, gives it a rub and BAM! out pops a genie. ""Okay,"" says the genie, ""you know the drill, three wishes, you don't wish for more wishes and I won't creatively misinterpret your wishes to give you tiny musicians, how about that? Go.""

Now, I'm not the type to rush into things, so I say to the genie, ""Okay, look, how about I give this some thought and get back to you?"" I put the bottle into his pocket and spend the next week giving serious thought to what one wish would make me the most happy. Eventually I pull the bottle out and says ""Okay, I'm ready to wish, genie.""

""About fucking time,"" says the genie, ""it's cramped in there, what do you wish for?""

""Well,"" I said, ""I've given it some thought, and I have decided that money can in fact buy happiness, and so I will have one billion dollars, please.""

BAM! ""It is done,"" says the genie, ""what is your second wish?""

""I don't know yet,"" said I, ""I'll get back to you.""

So I and look at my bank balance, and sure enough, it's a billion dollars. I go and buy an mansion and a yacht and a harem and all sorts of expensive rich-person stuff and I live the life of luxury for months. But all the time I'm wondering in the back of my head what's missing from my life that this second wish is going to give me, and thinking it over and over and trying to figure it out. And eventually I pull the bottle out of my pocket and say, ""Okay, genie, second wish.""

""Jesus fucking christ,"" says the genie, ""you don't make up your mind in a hurry, do you? What's it gonna be?""

""Genius."" I say. ""Creative, scientific, philosophical, all of the above. I wish to be the smartest, wisest man who ever lived.""

""Big ask,"" says the genie, ""but I'm up for it."" BAM! and it is done.""Do you reckon we can hurry it along and get to the third wish?"" the genie asks plaintively. ""I'm a busy genie."" I shake my head and say I want to give the matter some thought.

I spend the next several years solving the mysteries of the universes, revolutionising science, writing masterpieces, founding my own religion. I negotiate world peace and invent whole new schools of thought. All the time I'm thinking, okay, what would be even better than this? What is the one thing I could wish for next that would make my life absolutely perfect? And eventually, I figure it out.

I pull out out the bottle and say to the genie, ""Okay, it's third wish time.""

""Fucking finally"", says the genie, ""what's it gonna be? What's your last and greatest wish?""

I lean in close and whisper:

Two diplomats are riding in a limousine in Moscow, an Indian and a Russian, discussing state business.

The Russian says to the Indian, ""Ram, I like you, but my superiors say the deal can't go through. They don't want to be associated with your country. They tell me it's filthy and the citizens just shit on the streets.""

""That is not true!"" exclaims the Indian, ""We are very fastidious...in fact, you're not one to talk, isn't that someone shitting on your fine sidewalk?"" he points out the window where there is indeed a squatted figure defecating on the sidewalk.

The Russian diplomat is enraged. ""Stop the car!"" he yells at the driver, Pavel. ""Pavel, go execute that shitting man."" Pavel nods at his boss, stops the the car and takes out a gun.

After a minute, he shakes his head and returns to his boss. ""Sir, I cannot execute him.""

Stunned, but certain she's heard him wrong or misunderstood the woman asks, ""Um...are you asking me about the décor in my house?""  

The doctor replies, ""No, actually I'm asking if the color of the hair on your vagina matches that badly died blond on the top of your head.""

The woman immediately gathers her things and storms out, while the doctor dies in hysterical laughter, and kisses a small diamond ring in his pocket exclaiming, ""God, I love this thing!""

Suddenly, the orderly bursts into the room.  ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS I HEAR ABOUT YOU HARRASSING A PATIENT?!  DID YOU REALLY JUST ASK HER--""

""About the color of her pussy hair?"" the doctor interrupts, ""I did actually, and might I ask that you resume your seat and calm down a bit...women of your size tend to get a little winded with too much physical activity...and let's face it, for all we know you could be pregnant under there.  Best not to disturb junior...""

Both women explode from the room, vowing to return with the doctor's supervisor, as he once again bursts into a fit of enraptured laughter and clutches the diamond ring lovingly once more.

In five minutes, the two women have returned with a tall, stern looking man of about 60 with rage on his face, but before he has even asked the doctor a question, his rage doubles, as the first glimpse he has of the doctor, is his outstretched middle finger, directed to the spot right between his eyes as soon as he enters the door, 

""GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!  YOU'RE DONE!!!  IF YOU'RE NOT GONE IN 10 MINUTES, I'LL THROW YOU OUT THE GOD DAMNED--""

The doctor would never hear what he'd be thrown out of.  He had already sprinted from the room, cackling as he went, and not bothering to bring any possessions, besides the tiny diamond ring, which he kisses once more on his way out the door.

Surprisingly, the first person he meets outside happens to be his own brother, who he waves over.

""Dude...I love this fucking thing, bro...I LOVE IT!!""  

""Well, if you ask me, it's not really your color,"" the brother chuckles.

""No dude, it's not just a ring...it's my TOTEM!!  Whenever I see it, I know I'm dreaming!!"" the doctor says as the brother sees the ring more closely, and has a sudden realization as the doctor continues explaining, 

""None of this is real, it's all just in my head!  I can do anything I want..ANYTHING!!  Do you have any idea what I just said in th--

Death: ""That beer was nice. Thanks, Homer..You know what? Imma let you stay a little longer. I'm taking my list and start from the top.""","*Knock Knock* ""Homer, It's me Death. I have come for your soul...",2

As I get on the lift to go up to the top of the mountain, a man in a massive puffy cotton jacket sits next to me. Now when I say massive, I mean MASSIVE! I'm not sure how this guy could move, nevermind ski. I start making polite conversation with the man. Turns out his name is Joseph, and he's here on vacation from some tropical place I didn't catch the name of (hence why he's so over dressed). Anyway, we make it to the top of the hill, and he suggests we go to the terrain park (with jumps and rails). I ask him if he's ever done that before and he says no, but that he'd like to try. I shrug my shoulders, tell him to be safe, and down the trail we go. Suddenly, he veers off and begins to take a rail on his skis. And wouldn't you know it, the armature is doing it! Yet all of a sudden, I see his ski slip, and he falls off the rail. I see his jacket explode in stuffing, blood starting to pool around his eyes. Poor guy must have hit his eye on the rail during the fall! I rush over to him to see if he's okay, but he quickly gets up, and stuffs a gob of the jacket stuffing in his eye. Then he just skis away! And to be honest, I don't know where he'd come from, I didn't know where he'd go, but all I knew was that he was Cotton-Eye Joe",So I went skiing with a man in a massive jacket...[Original Joke],7

A few minutes go by, but the woman continues to roam the produce section looking lost. The worker approaches her again. “Can I help you find something else, miss?” “Yes”, she says. “Can you please direct me to the broccoli?” Puzzled, the man again replies “I’m sorry, we’re all out of broccoli. You’ll have to come back tomorrow.” Several more minutes go by, and the woman is still wandering around the produce section, looking more lost than ever. The man reluctantly approaches her for the third time. “Is there something else I can help you find?” he asks. “Yes” she says. “I’m looking for the broccoli”. The man gets a dumbfounded look on his face, and decides to attempt to figure out what exactly is wrong with this woman. “Ma’am…can you do me a favor and spell “cat”, as in “catastrophic”?” Without hesitation, she spells the word correctly. “Good” he says. “Now can you spell “dog” as in “dogmatic?”. Again, she recites the spelling flawlessly. “Very good, very good” says the man. “Now can you spell “fuck” as in “broccoli?”

 Looking confused, the woman asserts “But there is no “fuck” in broccoli”.
 
“I know!” The man exclaims. “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you!”

German car with a
Dutch engine, driven by a
Belgian who was high on
Scottish whiskey, followed closely by
Italian Paparazzi, on
Japanese motorcycles, treated by an

post,3prae2,2qh72,jokes,false,1445510697,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3prae2/engineer_vs_computer_scientist/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. ""What do you think this is?""

One advisor, an engineer, answered first. ""It is a toaster,"" he said.  The king asked, ""How would you design an embedded computer for it?"" The engineer replied, ""Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working prototype.""

The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, ""Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years.""

""With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes.""

""The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.""

""Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has
revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of  breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is
