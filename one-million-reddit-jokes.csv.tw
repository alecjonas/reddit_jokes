On a farm, twin race horses were born, Ned, who was older by 2 minutes, and younger brother Ted. Growing up they trained with each other and pushed each other to be the best they could. The day finally came when they were old enough for their first race.

The announcer addresses the crowd, ""Aaandddd they're off. It's Ned, it's Ted, it's Ned, it's Ted, it's Ted, and it's Ned by a nose.
Ted, disappointed by his loss goes out alone and starts training harder than ever not to be outdone by his slightly older brother. When the next race comes Ted is more confident than ever that he is going to win.

**repeat the announcer, it's ned, ted, ned, ted, ned by a nose, and ted training harder and harder as long as you can keep listeners attention**
**When listener becomes annoyed after 65 straight Ned wins**

Finally after a long horse racing career Ned and Ted are out in the pasture reflecting on their careers. Ted says, ""man, I thought I was going to get you just one time, but congrats Ned you always were the better racer.""
Just then, the farmers old dog comes up to the horses and says ""I have to tell you guys, I have been watching you your entire careers and what a pleasure it has been to watch you grow up into successful race horses."" 
Ned looks at Ted and says ""holy shit, a talking dog.""",Ned vs Ted,22

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another.

The man got the black one. Protesting, ""This is unfair! This must be repeated!"", he said before he drew the black straw again. 

After this process was repeated multiple times with the same results,  the man proposed desperately: ""Ok, I will jump off on one condition. You guess correctly the sum of the testicles I and the guy opposite of me possess and I'll do it. 

Everyone laughed. ""You must be kidding, it's four"", they all said, joyful that this hassle was about to end.

Now a rigorous mathematical proof has been developed that explains why this is true: 
Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power. 
Postulate 2: Time is Money. 
As every engineer knows, 
Work = Power * Time 
Since Knowledge = Power, and Time = Money, we have: 
Work = Knowledge * Money 
Solving for Money, we get: 
Money = Work / Knowledge 
Thus, as Knowledge decreases, Money increases, regardless of how much Work is done.

Everyone's looking at their menus, when the waiter comes by to get their drink orders.  Each orders their drinks, and as the waiter is walking away, the woman notices a spoon in his chest pocket.

*Hm... That's strange*  She thinks to herself.

She looks around, and notices other waiters and waitresses with spoons in their chest pockets.  Curious, she decides when their waiter comes back by, she'll just ask what that's about.

A few minutes later, he comes back with their drinks.  He proceeds to take their appetizer and main dish orders.  As he's about to leave, the women motions for him.  

""Yes m'am?"" he asks, leaning forward.

She asks, ""I noticed that every single member of the waitstaff have a spoon in their pockets...""  She pointed to his.  ""What's with the spoon?""

He smiles, and explains that their restaurant had ran through several studies to ensure that the waitstaff is the most efficient they can be, saving the customers and restuarant time and money.  One of the topics dealt with dropped silverwear.  The most commonly dropped piece is the spoon, since it is placed right next to the knife, and usually used last, it tends to get knocked off the table most often.  With that, it saves time and money for the waitstaff to have the spoon ready in-hand to hand to the customer.

She smiles and thanks him for the explanation, and just as she was reaching for her knife to butter her dinner roll, she just so happened to knock the spoon off the table.  Without missing a beat, the waiter hands her the spoon from his pocket with a smile.  She thanks him, smiling again.

As he walks away, however, she notices something new.  There was a string hanging from the waiter's fly!  

*How odd...*  She began looking around again, curiously.

She noticed all the male waitstaff had a string hanging from their pant flys as well.

She decides it may be another strange way to save money, but will ask later.

After dinner, everyone is served apple pie al la mode, and is just finishing up, when the waiter comes back by.  The woman calls him over again.  She asks about the string, pointing somewhat discreetly to it.

He laughs, and begins explaining that another part of the study dealt with cleanliness, and saving time and money at the same time.  He explained that when the men go to the bathroom, in order to save time and money from washing their hands, they could just unzip their flys and pull on the string, which would pull their penis out and allow them to urinate, all without laying a finger or palm on their privates.

She blushed, laughing.  ""How odd, but it must be true!  You all have been so quick to serve and everything!""  The waiter smiled, laughing.  Then he noticed a perplexed look on her face.

She stared for a second, thinking.  ""Wait, so, if you pull it out using the string, how do you... y'know... get it back in?""

The waiter looked around the room, and leaned in to the table.

""Personally, I use the spoon.""","A woman and her family are sitting in a nice, upscale restaurant...",18

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants.
SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.
SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What can we do?
SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.
SM: It's not working.
SL: Of course it's not working. But the man did the only logical thing. He started to walk faster too.
SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.
SL: The only logical thing we can do is split up. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both.
So the pair split up, with Sister Mathematical heading towards the convent and Sister Logical running away from it. Making a quick decision, the man decided to follow Sister Logical. Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to Sister Logical. But a few short minutes later, Sister Logical arrives.
SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!
SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he followed me.
SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?

Giving his funding situation, he goes up to the janitor and asks him ""Hey, for $500, would you have sex with this gorilla?""

The janitor thought about it for a minute, and then replied ""Sure, on three conditions. First condition, I don't want to kiss her.""

For those of you who have never traveled to the west, or southwest, cattle guards are horizontal steel rails placed at fence openings, in dug-out places in the roads adjacent to highways (sometimes across highways), to prevent cattle from crossing over that area. For some reason the cattle will not step on the ""guards,"" probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the rails. 

 A few months ago, Donald Trump received and was reading a report that there were over 100,000 cattle guards in Colorado . The Colorado ranchers had protested his proposed changes in grazing policies, so he ordered the Secretary of the Interior to fire half of the ""cattle"" guards immediately! 

 Before the Secretary of the Interior could respond and presumably try to straighten President Trump out on the matter, Vice-President Ben Carson intervened with a request that ... before any ""cattle"" guards were fired, they be given six months of retraining for border guards for the US-Mexico Wall. 'Times are hard', said Ben Carson, 'it's only fair to the cattle guards and their families!' ","The obligatory ""cattle guard"" joke for the next president",4

post,48oqct,2qh72,jokes,false,1456957555,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/48oqct/the_wagerer/,self.jokes,,"A guy walks into a bar, is seen by the bartender wandering from table to table, occasionally making them laugh, occasionally getting a scowl and pocketing a few dollars. Finally, he makes his way to the bar and sits down. ""Whats all that about?"" asks the barkeep

""Oh, I'm a professional wagerer"" he replies, further explaining that he has a number of various stupid human tricks he can do, and is pretty adept at accomplishing things suggested by others, for bets.
""Really?"" says the barkeep. ""Bet you 5 bucks you can't throw this cherry into a lowball glass from 10 feet""

""You're on"" says the wagerer. They shake, he grabs a cherry and a lowball glass, and sinks the shot his first attempt.

""I wanna warn you"", he says, pocketing the 5spot the bartender slapped on the counter, ""I am VERY coordinated"". 

""Okay"", says the barkeep, looking down at a regular sitting on the other side of the bar, a woman he knew to be as butch as they come, and not afraid to punch a man. ""Bet you 50 bucks you can't get her phone number""

The professional wagerer glances down at her, looks back at the barkeep, and says ""... 20 bucks, I'm a little skeptical of my odds with a woman with a shaved head"". 

""Deal"" says the bartender, watching the wagerer walk over, engage in polite conversation with her for awhile. He watches him do a couple stupid bar tricks, pull a card from behind her ear, and put the charm on hard. He was over there for a good 10 minutes before the wagerer threw up his hands and eventually made his way back to his seat.

""Well, you've got me. I couldn't get her number, here's your 20"" he said, slapping it on the table. Smiling, the bartender pocketed the cash, and went to fill an order.

""Wait, I have a wager for you"" said the man, grinning ear to ear. ""I bet you $300""... he said, counting out crisp twenties and laying them across the bar, ""that I can piss exactly 1 shot into 3 shot glasses, while standing on this barstool, while being slowly spun around, without splashing a drop"". He held his finger to his chin, in thought, and quickly added ""Blindfolded"".

The bartender looked carefully at the money, and thought it over. Surely there was no way that was possible, he thought, and after deliberation, replied ""You've got yourself a deal.""

""Okay,"" said the wagerer. ""I'm gonna need you to help me though. Stand to the side of me here, while I hop on the chair, and spin me around while I piss, okay?""

The bartender quickly set three shot glasses on the counter, and walked to the other side of the bar, while the wagerer wrapped a handkerchief around his eyes, grabbed his cock in his left hand, held out his right  hand to stabilize himself, and told the bartender to spin him. He took a few seconds to stabilize himself, as he spun, and loudly declared ""HERE I GO!""

He started pissing, and his bladder was clearly full. He started pissing on the floor, then the chair, then the bar, then the chairs, then across the face of the bartender, then again on the chairs. Piss was flying everywhere except for perhaps three or four drops that landed in the shot glasses. After he finished, and shook his cock dry, he lifted one side of the hankie from his eye and said ""Well fuck, guess I lost that one.""

Grinning ear to ear, and wiping the  piss from himself, the bartender started laughing, uproariously, at the idiotic bet the wagerer made. He walked over to the counter to collect his money, smiling, and turned to see something he didn't expect. The butch girl from the other side of the bar was walking over, slapped the wagerer, and started counting out hundreds from her rhinestone wallet, slapping them unceremoniously into the hands of the betting man.

""What's got you so worked up, Liz?"" the bartender asked her, still counting out his money.

""This fucker put the moves on me for a little while before I told him we bat for the same team, then he made a bet with me for a grand that he could, within half an hour, piss all over your face and bar and get you to laugh about it!""",The Wagerer,7

It was a Wednesday afternoon, but he still chose to go to the bar and grab a drink. It was mid October, so it was a little chilly. The wind was blowing a good bit. The bar was a few blocks from his job. He finally arrived at the bar. He had been here ay least a hundred times. As I said, it was Wednesday, so not many people were there. In fact only two people were in the bar: the Bartender and a strange looking man in the corner. Jim knew the bartender well so he ordered his usual drink, and decided to go sit with the strange man in the corner. As jim walked closer he realized that the man had an Orange for a head! This shocked jim but he didn't want to be rude. So he sat down and started a pretty casual conversation.
The man with an Orange for a head eventually acknowledged his strange appearance and told jim that he'd tell his story if he bought him a drink. Jim orders the man a drink, and he begins to tell the story. ""Well, as a young man I found an old lamp in the attic of my first home. As fate would have it, there was a genie in the lamp!"" He was very charismatic. ""Of course he offered me three wishes for setting him free. So, as any young man would do, I wished to be the richest man in the world."" Jim is awestruck, ""so, you're the richest man in the world?"" 
The orange man replied, ""Yes, In fact I own this bar. But that's beside the point. I still had two more wishes. For my second wish, I wished that I was the most desirable man on earth. And before you ask jim, yes it came true. It can get pretty annoying."" Jim just laughed and asked many many questions about what happened afterwards. It carried on late into the evening. The man with an Orange for a head got up to leave, but jim stopped him. ""Wait! What was your third wish?!"" 

The man with an Orange for a head stopped, and looked at Jim for what seemed like an eternity.

Then he finally spoke, ""I wished for an Orange for a head""",The man with an Orange for a head,5

An owl sat atop a tree branch, gazing upon the wonderful day. Just then, a little kid, no older than eleven, walked up to the tree. In his hand he held a lollipop. He called to the owl, so the owl flew down beside the boy. He then whispered something in the owl's ear, and handed it the lollipop.
The owl began to eat the lollipop, and just as it was finishing the boy picked up a blunt object--a baseball bat--previously abandoned by the tree by someone. He then proceeded to bludgeon the owl to near death. As he stood over the owl, he said one simple thing...

""How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop..?""

The Joplin , Missouri Police Department reported finding a man's body last Saturday in the Spring River near the Empire Electric Plant. The police would not release the dead man's name until his family had been notified.

The victim apparently drowned due to excessive beer consumption while visiting ""someone"" in Riverton , Kansas. He was wearing black fishnet stockings, nipple rings, a red garter belt, a pink G-string, purple lipstick, and an Obama T-shirt.

The police removed the Obama T-shirt to spare the man's family any unnecessary embarrassment.

They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Mr. Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word “Tragedy.”  So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy.

One little boy stands up and offers: “If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.”

“No,” says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explains the exalted businessman. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. No other children volunteer.  Mr. Trump searches the room.

“Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?”

Finally at the back of the room, a boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaims Mr. Trump, “That’s absolutely right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

“Well,” says the boy, “because it wouldn’t be a great loss and it probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”",What is a tragedy?,320

Some how, miraculously, he and the hitchhiker survive the crash and get out of the car, and there is the dog sitting there, and the driver notices he has a pink ring around his neck and asks the hitchhiker it has anything to do with how fast the dog can run.

He responds with, ""No, that's his asshole, he's not used to stopping so fast.""

He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench. The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a beautiful piece by Mozart.
“Where on earth did you get that ???” asked the surprised bartender. The man responds by reaching into the paper bag. This time he pulls out a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says: “Here. Rub it.”
So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there’s a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him. “I will grant you one wish – just one.”
The bartender gets real excited. Without hesitating he says, “I want a million bucks !”
A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. Another duck, then another soon follow it. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!

One student said let's put the cops under investigation and do desk work until it's over. More officers started shooting because it was a convenient life. Another said make it so police can't eat or go home for another 6 hours to discourage this. The police then ignore crime around those times and the criminal AI noticed. Crime rates rose significantly

The students agreed to undo the last rule and give police a paycut if they shoot someone no exceptions. Police now shoot people and quit the next morning causing a massive shortage. Another student had a bright idea of having body cameras. Everything was fine for a few simulated days but the police AI noticed if they stand behind a car or some object the camera will pick up it instead of the conflict. Police AI now stand behind cars or trees for a minute or two before shooting civilizations

Frustrated the students asked the computer science student next to them who ran an operating system that was neither windows or mac. They said they think there is a bug in the simulation bc the police won't stop shooting people. The CS student had them explain the problem. After they explained he looked at them like they were idiots. He suggested they **remove** all that crap they added, **remove** the part where police can use a gun on the job and **remove** the gun being part of police uniform/equipment. Let police carry a gun like they can carry dental floss. They have one but isn't considered equipment.

To everyone's amazement this worked. Now when it's almost lunch or a shift change police just drag people to dark alleys to beat the shit out of them or plant false evidence. Society score was drastically improved because of no fatal police shootings

Alternative punchline: One trouble student said this is stupid we can't use this. Everyone knows we can't remove laws!

Alternative punchline: After a few days a student calls the group up and wants to deal with police beatings. He says I know we should **add**...",Paralegal and computer science student notice police shoot citizens in their AI simulation whenever it's almost lunch or a shift change,0
