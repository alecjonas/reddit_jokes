""I see your ears are working, too,"" says the duck. ""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""

""Certainly, sorry about that"" says the bartender as he pours the duck a pint. ""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?""

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" explains the duck. ""I'm a plasterer.""

The flabbergasted bartender cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the bartender says to him:

""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""

""Sounds marvelous,"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. ""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the bartender says, ""Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""

""I'm always looking for the next job,"" says the duck. ""Where is it?""

""At the circus,"" says the bartender.

""The circus?"" repeats the duck.

""That's right,"" replies the bartender.

""The circus?"" the duck asks again. ""With the big TENT?""

""Yeah!"" the bartender replies.

""With all the animals who live in CAGES, and performers who live in CARAVANS?"" says the duck.

""Of course,"" the bartender replies.

""And the tent has CANVAS sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

""That's right!"" says the bartender.

The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says: ""What would they want with a plasterer??""

A few months later, the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily accepts and the date is set.

Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes. After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break the silence and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes, the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses his woman in front of her family. No one says a word. Emboldened, he slips his hand under her blouse and fondles her breasts. Still no one says a word. Finally, he throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of everyone. No one says a word. Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws HER on the table. They have even wilder sex. Still no one speaks.

Many hundreds of years ago, an old, old Native American chief lived in the valleys somewhere in America. This chief had the most beautiful daughter named White Doe. Every man in the tribe wanted to wed the daughter of the Chief, but could never muster up the courage to do it.


By chance, two of the men in the tribe mustered up the courage to ask the chief for permission to marry White Doe at the same time. One was named Winding River, and the other was named Falling Rock. They were of equal skill level and physical strength, so the Chief could not pick one to marry his daughter. He had a clever idea. He said to the two men, ""Whichever of you goes out into the wilderness and brings me a white doe first can marry my daughter, White Doe."" 


This task was extremely difficult because the deer that had to be found was female and albino, which is the rarest kind of deer. Both men would not back down from the challenge, though. Winding River went off to the plains to find a white doe. Falling Rock went up into the mountains to look for a white doe. 


A few months later, Winding River returned empty-handed and out of luck. Falling Rock had not been back for two years, and the tribe was getting worried. The chief decided to find Falling Rock and marry his daughter to him because of his bravery and persistence in finding a real life white doe. So he sent out search parties in the mountains to look for him.


All of the searches turned up empty. Falling Rock was never found. Legend has it that Falling Rock is still being searched for in the mountains today. That is why many road and trail signs say ""Watch Out for Falling Rock.""
Next time you are in the mountains, be sure that if you see Falling Rock, you will show him the signs and remind him that there are people still looking for him back at his tribe, and that his bride awaits. ",Falling Rock,4

I was in a bar restroom at the urinals getting rid of my daily intake of beer when in walks in the shortest guy I had ever seen.  I thought to myself as he approached the urinal that there was no way that he would be able piss in the ""adult"" urinal, but he surprised me when pulled out the biggest cock that I had ever seen and wrapped it over the lip like a true fire house.  My jaw involuntarily dropped open for a second, and I managed to spit out the question of how in the hell he has such a big cock, completely ignoring my til then lifelong rule of not talking to another guy who has his dick in his hand.  

The little man finishes up and tucks his beast away and says ""Well, you caught me.  I am a leprechaun. You get to make three wishes.""

I quickly gushed ""I wish for a big dick like yours, all the money I could ever need or want, and to never have a worry again.""  

""Done,"" he said.  ""But given how big of wishes you are making, I will be demanding something in return.  In order for your to get those wishes granted, you must let me fuck you in the ass in that there stall.""  

For the second time in that bathroom my mouth stood agape.  I thought about it for a while and convinced myself that for all that money it was worth it.  

So I let the leprechaun fuck me in the ass in a small bar stall.  And when he was done he said ""Aren't you a little old to be believing in leprechauns?"" as he walked out the door.  And that was the day I grew up.  ",The Time I Met a Leprechaun in a Bathroom,7

Then he rolls over, lights up a cigarette and asks her, “So…. you finish?”

Surprised, but pleasantly, he puts out his cigarette, rolls back on top of her, and has his way with her again, this time lasting even longer than the first… and this time completing the deed with even louder shouts. 
Again he rolls over, lights a cigarette, and asks, “So…. you finish?”
And again, after a short pause, she simply says “No.” 

Stunned, but still acting reflexively on his macho pride, he once again puts out the cigarette, and mounts his companion du jour. This time, with all the strength he could muster up, he barely manages to end the task, but he does, after quite some time and energy is spent. 
Barely able to roll over, he reaches for his cigarette … lights it again, and then asks tiredly, “So… you finish?”

Hi! I'm a lady aged 26 married with one kid. Last week my husband was off duty and I had to drive alone to work. I left my husband with the maid and my baby at home. I drove for just about two miles from home and my car engine started to overheat so I had to turn back to get another car. When I got home I found my husband in bed with our maid. I don't know what to do now. Please help!

Reply:
Dear Anonymous,
Overheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburettor. You need to check your oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey. You must also make sure your car is serviced regularly to avoid problems in future. 
Hope this helped you.","The reason men aren't allowed to run advice in ""Love Columns"" in magazines and newspapers..",77

As they were jumping over the gate to enter the cemetery, two oranges fell out of the big bag but they didn't bother to pick them since they had enough in the bag.

A few minutes later, a drunk man on his way home from a bar passed near the cemetery gate and heard a voice saying: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

He immediately sobered up and ran as fast as he could to a church nearby.

""Father, please come with me. Come and witness God and Satan sharing corpses at the cemetery.""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate and the voice continued: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

Suddenly, the voice stopped counting and said: ""What about the two at the gate?""

The giraffe. He was stuck in a refrigerator  
  
***** 
  
An old man is walking along a nature path, enjoying his last years on earth. A warning sign appears, warning about the dangerous man eating crocodiles in the river ahead. He gets to the river, to find out there is no bridge! He looks left, he looks right, but his feet are quite tired and he doesn't feel like looking for a bridge, log, or anything to get him across without going in the river. So, he removes his socks and shoes and walks across the dirty river.  
Why didn't the crocodiles attack him?  
  
They were still at the animal party.  
  
***** 
  
As the old man finally gets across, he becomes quite tired, and rests. He shouldn't have pushed himself so much, walking along such a long trail. When he gets up to continue, he dies suddenly. How did he die?  
  
A box fell out of an airplane and killed him.  ",This joke works better told than read. There are 15 boxes in an airplane. One falls out. How many are left?,47

He used to make sure his favourite one was kept polished and well maintained and everything...

But one day he fell off while driving to his fields and it put him right off his hobby.

--------

He was at the village pub one day when there was a fire in the kitchen. 

It was billowing great huge plumes of black smoke. Thick and nasty and horrible, and all of the other people in the pub were spluttering and coughing, and they couldn't get out. The situation was *terrible*.

So ...

Doug went in to the kitchen, inhaled, sharply, and deeply and all of the smoke went away. Everyone was able to get out safely.

You see...  Doug... 

He was an ex-tractor fan.

There was a guy named Shawn and he lived near a really little town in the western plains of Texas. This town was really just a dot along a highway and didn't get much traffic at all. There was one gas station, a diner, and a little dollar store with necessities and household items. 

Shawn worked at the store, his first job. Shawn did stocking, and cleaning, and sometimes helped out on the register. It was an easy job and never too busy. 

The town was so slow and lazy it was this dollar store's practice to close completely on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and did not reopen until the following Monday. That meant several days off for Shawn!

One Thanksgiving the store closed up as usual on Wednesday and everybody went home to their families for turkey day. Shawn went fishing with friends on Friday and they drove to Midland on Saturday to visit a few bars. It was a late night and Shawn didn't get to bed until late. 

Early Sunday morning the phone rang and Shawn heard his boss's urgent voice: ""Shawn I need you up here at the store right away, we've got major problems!""

Groggily Shawn groaned. What could have happened to be so urgent!?

Shawn made his way to work and was astonished with what he saw. The front window was shattered and the store was a disaster. One aisle in particular seemed to have most of the damage. Piles of dishes from the dish section were scattered all over the floor. 

There was a terrible stench with blood, guts, and feces everywhere and all over the broken dishes. A large deer lay dead in the middle of the aisle. 

Shawn was aghast. What a mess. How did this happen?!

The manager had already assessed the events so he filled Shawn in: ""it looks like this deer was smacked by a car on the highway. In his delirium he smashed through the window and went nuts right here in the dish section. Now, it looks like we have 
a wrecked aisle dish funk Shawn!""

        After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that
they were not going to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and
they discussed their predicament in great depth.

        Finally the priest said to the nun, ""You know, Sister, I am
about to die, and there's always been one thing I've wanted here on
earth -- to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes
so I can look at you?""

        The nun thought about his request for several seconds and
then agreed to take off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked,

""Well, Father, now that I think about it, I've never seen a man naked,
either. Would you mind taking off your clothes, too?""

        With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the
nun exclaimed, ""Father! What is that little thing hanging between your
legs?""

        The priest patiently answered, ""That, my child, is a gift from
God. If I put it in you, it creates a new life.""

        ""Well,"" responded the nun, ""forget about me. Stick it in the

But to my surprise, cars started slowing down to look at my cardboard cutouts. And, of course, traffic began backing up. Everybody tooted their horns and waved like crazy. It wasn't long before a state trooper pulled up behind me. 

He got out of his car and walked towards me. I could tell he was not a happy camper! 

""What's going on here?""

He's going with an all red theme; red sink, red countertop, red toilet. The whole shabang.
He starts first with the red countertop, then he installs the red sinks and toilet, then he finally starts laying the tiles. 
The ground tiles are laid first, followed by the wall tiles.
Eventually there is only 1 tile left to be laid.
The man does just as he did for all the other tiles and coats the wall section in cement.
He then places the tile on the section and holds it for a moment.
But this time when he lets go the tile falls to the ground.
So he puts a little more cement on the wall and tries again, holding longer.
But the tile falls off again.
Frustrated, the man calls up his contractor for assistance.
""Hey man I might need your help"".
""Yeah sure, what is it?"".
""I've got this tile I'm laying down and I just can't seem to get it to stay up"".
""Alright I'll come take a look at it""
So the man's contractor comes over, and starts in the same way.
Placing the tile up on the wall only for it to fall down.
Then laying down more cement and trying again.
After seeing this the contractor says "" I think I know what your problem is"".
""What is it?""
""You have aredtile dysfunction"".

Then out of nowhere, one of the men turns around and says to the others...

""I am a genie, and I may grant each of you a wish. As you jump off this cliff, yell out an object on which you want to fall.""

One man decides that even though it seems very unlikely for this to be true, it's his best bet to escape from the police.

He jumps off and yells ""PILLOWS!"" at the top of his lungs. As he falls a huge pile of pillows materializes and breaks his fall.

Seeing that the genie was no joke the second man decided to give it a go, but with something a little more useful to him.

He throws himself off the cliff and shouts out ""DOLLAR BILLS!"" And a very large bundle is at the bottom to stop him from hurting himself.

Now the last man to jump off has seen what the powers can do. He knows he can not only survive, but make it rich. He decides he's going to ask for a huge pile of golden thread to land on, and sell to make it big.

So he runs towards the edge at full speed, ready to scream his request to the heaven-sent genie. As he reaches the edge, he trips on a small boulder and yells,

He looked around and saw a tractor open with the engine running, he dashed over and got in before driving off. 
Because he didn't know how to drive a tractor he crashed many times and caused many thousands of dollars worth of damage. He was pulled over by the police and sent to court. The judge found him guilty of property damage and gave him two options, pay the fine and go to jail or get rid of all his tractor merchandise and stop being a tractor fan.
After many months he got over it and got his life back on track. He'd managed to get a date with a very attractive women and they sat down in a bar which allowed smoking inside.

These crows always post a sentry while they eat roadkill to warn them of any approaching traffic. The problem lies neither in the sentry nor the larger body of crows, but in miscommunication. The crows have learned to say ""Car! Car!"" but they have not learned how to say ""Truck! Truck!""

Upon reception St.Peter allowed them to ask any questions they desired and they would receive an answer.

Zebra stumbles to St.Peter, anxious to finally be able to ask his question.

""St.Peter, my whole life I have been so confused about who I am. I have black stripes and I have white stripes.
But which one am I? Am I Black or am I white?""

St.Peter furrows his brow contemplating the question at hand. Moments pass and he has still not come
up with an answer.

""Zebra, I am sorry but I cannot answer that question for you... however, I do know someone who can.""

St.Peter points to another gate to the side and motions for Zebra to follow.

""This is the door to the big man *himself*. He will surely have the answers you seek.""

St.Peter ushers Zebra through the door and waits for him to return. 

After a short while Zebra exits the gates, slightly somber and mulling over the words spoken to him.

""Well, what did he say?""

Shaking his head Zebra replies, ""He said that I am not defined by the color of my stripes. I can be 
whatever I wanted to be. I can be black, I can be white, I can be both or I can be neither
if that's what I choose."" Zebra sighs, ""I guess you are who you are.""

Upon hearing this St.Peter throws his arms up in jubilation. Beaming St.Peter 
exclaims, ""Well, there you have it. Your answer. You're white!""

Thoroughly confused at this revelation Zebra asks, ""What do you mean?""

""If you were black you would have said ""you *is* who you *is*.""

Luckily, we are on good terms so I am the only person who knows the password, 0451 if you want to know. Sometimes he changes it like for the New Years he sets it as the year, or Christmas time when he changes it to the date, but it's late fall right now so there he has it set as the regular code. Although once he decided to be a little generous, he got a new heating system for the office, it's a little screwy sometimes, you turn the heat on but it never actually turns on. But the heaters came with new thermostats, these show the date and the time on them.

 There are only three other guys in the office, Tim, he's just a weird one, he asks about what kind of stamps we buy, I don't like him much. Then there is some gay guy. I can't remember his name, he's not exactly a vibrant person, he blends in to the office like he is part of it. Lastly there is an old guy, he's been in the office for decades now, I think he might just be dead and no one ever checked, I have never seen that man leave his office chair. 

Right now, we are all working overtime, I think I might have forgotten to go home last night, I can't remember. There was a big crisis back at HQ and now we are stuck with the paperwork. I really don't know what day it is. Suddenly that old guy yells over, ""Turn up the heat!"" I don't blame him, it's freezing, must be that new heating. After he sees me get up he decides to go be unproductive somewhere else by taunting the other guys. I walk over to the thermostat, I figure I should see what time it is, since I don't remember sleeping.

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday.
The regular code, I punch it right in.

I've planted a Pakistani flag in each corner of my front garden and a large Black Flag of ISIS in the centre. I grew a beard and only wear turbans in my freetime.

Now, the Washington Police, the FBI, the National Security Agency, Scotland Yard, MI-5, MI-6, the CIA and every other intelligence service in the world are all watching my house 24x7x365. 

My children are followed to school every day and my wife when she goes shopping. I'm followed to and from work every day. So no one bothers me at all.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. 

The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. 

Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. 

She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in !!!”

The man had done many great things for others in his life, but he felt like none of it made a difference to humanity. As he began to ponder that it was all the small things in life that really mattered, he stumbled across a howling gorilla in agony. Within a net, the beast desperately tired to free itself, but with each attempt, became more and more entangled and howled louder and louder in pain. Upon approaching the massive beast, the man quickly became intensely scared, nervous that the gorilla would retaliate. Trembling with beads of sweat drenched across his brow, the man slowly cut the net and the gorilla stomped through the jungle and never turned back.

Years later a happy man returned to the jungle with a new born child in search of a way to teach his son a new way of life. To show him that it is the small things in life that make a difference to better humanity. Upon traversing across a small, misty creek littered with green ferns the man saw a scarred gorilla by a river bed. He was sure that this was the same gorilla he had saved from the net years ago. The gorilla turned and made eye contact with the happy man, son by his side. As the man approached and held out his arm to greet the familiar creature, the gorilla hoisted him high up into the air and vigorously bashed his brains in on a giant rock. He was thrown far into the river and drowned to death. Must have not have been the same gorilla.

The next day he returned to the zoo and set the items in a bag within arm's distance of the gorilla exhibit and waited until he got the gorilla's attention. Once the gorilla saw him he reached into the bag for a hat and placed it on his head. The gorilla did the same. Then the man grabbed one of the horns and started playing it. The gorilla grabbed the other horn and started playing the same tune. Finally, the man reached into the bag and grabbed the knife. Before coming to the zoo he had stuffed the hot dog down his pants and at this point he unzipped his fly and pulled the hot dog halfway out. He then cut it in half with the knife.
