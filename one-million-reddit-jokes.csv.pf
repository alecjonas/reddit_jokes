Lady 2: You can get them at any drugstore.

 ""How much?"" he asks the old man behind the counter. ""Well now,"" says the clerk. ""That's an interesting piece you're holding there. It'll be $30 for the item itself- and $1000 for the story."" The man doesn't think twice. ""Tell you what, Pops, I'll take the rat and you keep your story!""

 The man leaves the store holding his new treasure and decides to walk down to the harbor since it's such a nice day.

 Suddenly, as he passes a sewer grate, a plump rat scurries out and begins to follow him. Seconds later, two more. The man quickens his pace. The more sewer grates he passes, the more rats leap out and begin to follow. He panics and begins to run. More rats pour out- and then more! He sees the masts of tall ships getting closer and he bolts. Glancing quickly behind him he sees a vast carpet of rats growing by the second! Now he's running full tilt. Thousands of rats fill the street behind him! He's running all out, the weight of the brass rat is heavy in his hands as he sees the pier ahead. Giving one final push, the man leaps with the last of his strength and lands precariously atop a pier pole, just as the army of rats swarm over the dock and into the water where they all drown.

 Back at the shop, a small bell rings as the man staggers back in, covered with sweat.

 ""Hey.. (pant... pant) old man... I... I need to know-""

 ""Ah"", says the clerk with a sly grin. ""I knew you'd be back for the story!""

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,502

The Allergists were in favor of scratching it, but
the Dermatologists advised not to make any rash moves.
The Gastroenterologists had sort of a gut feeling about it, but
the Neurologists thought the Administration had a lot of nerve.
Meanwhile, Obstetricians felt certain everyone was laboring under a misconception, while
the Ophthalmologists considered the idea shortsighted.
Pathologists yelled, ""Over my dead body!"" while
the Pediatricians said, ""Oh, grow up!""
The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while
the Radiologists could see right through it.
Surgeons decided to wash their hands of the whole thing and
the Internists claimed it would indeed be a bitter pill to swallow.
The Plastic Surgeons opined that this proposal would ""put a whole new face on the matter.""
The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists were pissed off at the whole idea. 
Anesthesiologists thought the whole idea was a gas, and those lofty Cardiologists didn't have the heart to say no.
In the end, the Proctologists won out, leaving the entire decision up to the assholes in Washington.

He says to the man ""Sir, I'd like to purchase your rooster and hen."" The man replies ""You must not be from around here. In the south we call hens 'pullets' and we call the males 'cocks'. I don't have any cages to put them in for you so you'll just have to hold them so they don't get away from you."" 

The Yankee farmer pays for thr chickens and continues looking. Soon he spots a donkey for sale for a really good price. 

The Yankee farmer says ""Sir why is your donkey so cheap?"" The man says ""Ah you must not be from around here. We don't call them donkeys in the south, they are called 'asses'. But yeah this one here every now and then will get stubborn and not want to move. You can get him going if you give him a good scratch behind the ears though.""

The Yankee farmer pays for the donkey and starts walking home with the chickens in arms and the donkey following close by. Sure enough the donkey locked up and stopped following. Luckily though a young lady was walking by and he thought maybe she could help. 

The Yankee farmer said ""Excuse me ma'am could you please help me?"" She said ""Sure, you're not from around here are you?""

Yet this is not a regular chastity belt, because the knight was cruel and capricious. This chastity belt had spikes and blades inside so that anyone who would try to have sex with his wife would have their member scarred and mangled. And off to the crusades he goes!

Several years later he returns from the crusade, bloody and weary. His first order of business is to call all his servants together and line them up in the hallway. Somewhat nonplussed, the servants line up as requested. The knight demands that all his servants immediately drop their breeches. Sure enough, every one of his servants' organs are cut and mutilated. Every one that is, except for one.

The knight walks over to this last servant and says, ""My wife is a very beautiful lady, and I commend you on having the restraint to not fuck her. Name your reward and it will be yours!""

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""
Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""
Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",The moral of the story,4

He puts his rifle sling over his shoulder but before he can step out of the shadows into the clearing he is tapped upon the shoulder. He turns and sees a massive grizzly bear. The Grizzly in a stern tone says to the hunter ""That was my cousin you murdered. By right I should maul you to death then eat you. Seeing as I have just eaten I'll offer you a choice, I kill you as I mentioned or we have sex."" The hunter reluctantly agrees to have sex with the grizzly.

Three months later after he has recovered physically the hunter embarks out into the wilderness in search of the Grizzly who raped him, on a quest for vengeance. The hunter spies the Grizzly in a tree sleeping, he knows it is the very same, he couldn't forget if he tried. He aims, fires and watches the lifeless bear tumble to the forest floor. As he stands up he hears a twig snap behind him and he whirls around to see an even bigger Grizzly. 

""That was my sister you butchered."" Says the 14 foot tall Grizzly. ""Now i'll give you a choice, since i'm not in the mood for man-flesh. Either I maul you to death right here and leave you for the buzzards, or we have rough bear sex."" The exhausted hunter reluctantly agrees to go through this ordeal yet again. He agrees to get bear fucked for 2 straight hours.

6 months later the hunter is back on his feet again and after 8 months he is fit enough to venture back into the woods. He finds the massive Grizzly and shoots it without hesitation but just as he lowers his rifle he hears a voice behind him, chuckling to itself. The hunter turns around and sees a giant polar bear. The polar bear says to the hunter ""Admit it, you aren't out here for the hunting.""

Love though this was great - provocative and rude - so she went with it. Her ex, Corey Hart, of 'Sunglasses At Night' fame, did not approve. He sought to confront Bon Jovi on the night of Hole's first gig and, a little drunk, tried to climb the fence of Bon Jovi's LA estate.

Bon Jovi, thinking Hart an intruder, winged him with a gun belonging to Bono and The Edge's tour manager, who was dining there that night. The ensuing fracas was in all the papers, overshadowing Hole's debut, and angering Kurt Cobain, who was interested in Hole's lead singer.

Cobain sent Jon Bon Jovi a note, demanding he apologise, and Bon Jovi replied ...

""Shot Corey Hart, and U2 blamed. You give Love a band name.""

He posed the question of just how much of sex was ""work"" and how much of it was ""pleasure?"" A Major chimed in with 25-75% in favor of work . A Captain said it was 50-50%. A lieutenant responded with 25-75% in favor of pleasure , depending upon his state of inebriation at the time.
There being no consensus, the general turned to the PFC (Private First Class) who was in charge of making the coffee. What was HIS opinion?
Without any hesitation, the young PFC responded, ""Sir, it has to be 100% pleasure.""

He yelled at the bird, and the bird got worse. He shook the bird, and the bird got madder and more rude.

Finally, in a moment of desperation, Jimmy put the parrot in the freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking and screaming and then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet.

Jimmy was frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird, and quickly opened the freezer door.

The parrot calmly stepped out onto Jimmy's extended arm and said, ""I'm sorry that I offended you with my language and my actions, and I ask your forgiveness. I will endeavour to correct my behaviour"".

Jimmy was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to ask what had changed him, when the parrot continued, ""May I ask what the Chicken did?""",Jimmy received a parrot for Christmas.,831

In the first round, the first robot had the lead, when he was able to tear out a crucial wire in the other robot's body. The other robot, not to be defeated, was also successful in doing the same to the first robot. The first round was not won by any robot.

The second round was more interesting, where the second robot was able to remove a large amount of the covering that the first robot had. Both robots were covered in protective material (so they weren't killed instantly), so the loss of the material was a huge blow to the first robot.

In the third round, both sides, having taken a break (and some steroids perhaps) tore at each other more savagely than before, managing to remove all the protective material that shielded each robot. The match, being extremely close, was finally ended when the first robot succeeded in knocking down the second robot.

He waved his arms and suddenly three large swimming pools appeared in front of them. ""I will grant each of you one wish! Just as you jump into your swimming pool, yell out whatever it is you wish the pool to be filled with and it shall be yours!""
First off, the German went. He walked to the edge of the pool and jumped in, screaming; ""BIIIEEEERRR!"". The pool was filled to overflowing with cold, refreshing, golden beer and the German was laughing and tumbling and drinking it in big gulps.
Then, the Frenchman wanted to try too. He walked up to his pool, pinched his nose and dove in, head first, yelling; ""VIIIN!"". His pool instantly filled with perfectly tempered red wine and the Frenchman floated on his back with his head tipped to one side, slurping up the best wine he had ever tasted.
In the end the American decided that it was his turn. He had been thinking for a long time what he wanted in his pool, so he got a running start from far away. He started sprinting. He went faster and faster, grinning from ear to ear, thinking about what he was going to get. Just as he got to the edge of the pool, his foot slipped on a puddle of beer and went flopping over the edge; ""OH SHIT!!""","A German, a Frenchman and an American",3

Two very attractive human-like aliens, a 'male' and a 'female' step out of the UFO and walk towards them. They ask the farmer and his wife if they can come inside. The farmer, flabbergasted, but filled with curiosity, says ""Sure, come on in"" and let's the two aliens inside. He and his wife make them some tea and then sit down to talk. After several hours of talking, jokes, and a lot of questions, the 'male' alien leans forward to the farmer and says ""I find your wife very attractive. Would you two be willing to trade your wife for mine for the night?"" Again, the farmer is flabbergasted and looks over at his wife to see her looking at him with a twinkle in her eye. ""Oh Earl, we've been married for 37 years now. When will we ever have another chance like this?"" Earl's eyebrows shoot to the top of his head as he stutters out ""Mary, are y-you s-sure?"" She smiles and nods. Earl looks over at his newly matched short-term counterpart, and feels some fire return to his loins. ""Well, hell! If everyone's on board, I'm for it!"" So, each of the new couples agree to take separate rooms in the house and meet for breakfast in the morning. Mary leads the male alien off into a guest room and quickly pulls her clothes off while watching him get naked. When he finally removes his pants, though, her face goes from excitement to disappointment. ""What's wrong?"" the alien asks. ""Oh,"" she replies ""I was just hoping you'd be a little... longer... than that."" ""Well, that's not a problem, "" he says and begins twisting his right ear. Immediately his nether regions grow 3 times in length.""Wow!"" Mary exclaims ""That's amazing! But.. it's still a little too thin.."" The alien smiles. ""Well, that's not a problem either!"" He then  twists his left ear and his cock-a-doodle-do gets 3 times thicker. ""Sweet jumpin' Jehovas!"" cries Mary. ""Let's get this show started!"" And the two of them get to business.

--------------------

The next day, both the worn out couples meet in the kitchen for breakfast. Mary smiles as Earl asks her ""Well, how'd it go?"" ""Oh,"" Mary replies, ""It was amazing! We went at it for almost 2 hours straight until I couldn't take it anymore! How about you dear? Did you enjoy it?"" 

""Well.."" Earl replies ""Not really.. this one over here just kept twisting my ears the whole night!""

He asks the lady,

'Do you have a vagina?'

She slams the door in disgust.

The next morning she hears a knock at the door and it is the same man and he asks the same question of the woman,

'Do you have a vagina?'

She slams the door again.

Later that night when her husband gets home she tells him what has happened for the last two days. The husband tells the wife in a loving and concerned voice,

'Honey, I am taking tomorrow off to be home just in case this guy shows up again.'

The next morning they hear a knock and both run for the door. The husband says to the wife in a whispered voice,

'Honey, I'm going to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the question because I want to see where the bastard is going with it.'

She nods yes to her husband and opens the door. Sure enough the same fellow is standing there and asks the same question;

'Do you have vagina'?

'Yes, actually I have one,' she says.

The man replies,

'Good! Would you mind telling your husband to leave my wife's alone and start using yours?'",Do you have a vagina?,282

The next day he saw a girl getting harassed and remembered the second proverb, ""fortune favours the bold"", so he stepped in and helped the girl. That night he went a date with her.

The next day he went to his martial arts class. He was paired up with another boy to spar with katanas. As they squared up, he dropped his pants, grabbed his dong and started whacking the other kid with it.

He comes back after some time and gave the man a bottle of pills, telling him to take 2 every day, morning and evening.

And thus the man was cured. When asked what The Doctor gave him, he would always laugh at The Doctor's wisdom.

Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW program (Scheme Covering Retired-Early Workers).

A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as Management deems appropriate. Persons who have been RAPED could get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependants &amp; Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance).

Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by Management.

Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. Management has always prided itself on the amount of SHIT it gives employees.

""What's going on in here?"" the man asks St Peter. 

""Oh that's the Pentecosts."" says St Peter nonchalantly. 

""That's odd "" the man says. ""Pentecosts are usually really loud, and jubilant and jumping around and speaking in tongues. Why are they so quiet?"" 

""Well on Earth they were loud and jubilant. Now that they're in Heaven, they have found tremendous value in silent reflection.""

""Oh that's interesting"" the man says as they continue walking. A few minutes later they pass another large room with people running around, screaming, whooping and hollering with excitement. 

""who are these people?"" the man asks. 

""Oh those are the Catholics."" says St. Peter. 

""WHAT?"" says the man stunned. 

""Yeah, you see on Earth the Catholics were silent, and ritualistic. Now that they're in Heaven they're filled with excitement and joy like they've never had.""

""Huh. Ok"" says the man still somewhat surprised. They continue walking. 

They eventually arrive at a third door which is shut, chained, and locked. There's a giant sign hung on the door which simply says ""QUIET!""

Finally, he came across a book store with a ""help wanted"" sign. He went in and got a job.  
  
His boss told him that he could not work in the store, but he would walk around the neighborhood selling books door to door. The boss didn't think the stuttering employee had a chance.  
  
After one hour, the stuttering man returned with $1000. The boss could not believe it. The boss sent him out again, and the stuttering man returned with $1000 the next hour.  
  
The boss asked him ""how do you sell so well?!""  
  
The stuttering man said ""Well, b-b-b-b-boss, it's simp-p-p-p-p-p-ple, I j-j-j-just w-w-w-wait t-t-t-till they open the d-d-d-door, and I t-t-t-tell them that they c-c-c-can either b-b-b-buy the b-b-b-b-book, or I c-c-c-can r-r-read it t-t-to them.""",A stuttering dude was unemployed...,116

Scared as she was, she went to the doctors office and received a male doctor in the urgent matters.
She explained her problem to him. He said there was nothing to worry about.

""Just go home and put some honey on your husbands dick, and ask him to put it in you. In that way the bee will stick to the honey and your husband can just take it out"".

The woman explained to the doctor that she had no husband or a boyfriend.

The doctor would gladly help her in this case, and did what he had said. He put some honey on his dick and put it in her vagina. But suddenly he started to move it back and forth and the woman asked ""shouldn't you just stay inside""
The doctor said in a rush ""I changed my mind, i'm gonna shoot that motherfucker instead""
