She then tells the blonde that she paid for economy class, and that she will have to sit in the back.

The blonde replies, “I’m blonde, I’m beautiful, I’m going to Sydney and I’m staying right here”.

The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the pilot and the co-pilot that there is a blonde bimbo sitting in first class, that belongs in economy, and won’t move back to her seat.

The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for economy she will have to leave and return to her seat.

The blonde replies, “I’m blonde, I’m beautiful, I’m going to Sydney and I’m staying right here”.

The co-pilot tells the pilot that he probably should have the police waiting when they land to arrest this blonde woman who won’t listen to reason.

The pilot says, “You say she is a blonde? I’ll handle this, I’m married to a blonde. I speak blonde”.

He goes back to the blonde and whispers in her ear, and she says, “Oh, I’m sorry” and gets up and goes back to her seat in economy.

The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss.

I told her, “First class isn’t going to Sydney “","A flight is on its way to Sydney when a blonde in economy class gets up, and moves to the first class section and sits down",112

post,bbw62o,2qh72,jokes,false,1554960694,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bbw62o/centuries_ago_on_a_remote_island_in_the_north/,self.jokes,,"Vikings arrived and began a settlement with help from their Irish thralls. But they weren't alone. All manner of otherworldly beings lurked in the island's hidden corners. The Vikings called these beings *vættir*; the Gaels called them *Aes Sídhe*.

Among these beings were the selkies who frolicked at outcroppings on the shore. These creatures looked like seals in the water, but they shed their hides on land to reveal beautiful human forms underneath. The Norse chieftain Valbrand saw the prettiest female selkie, whose name was Eyfridh, and decided he wanted her for himself.

As Eyfridh slept on the beach at the edge of the forest, Valbrand snatched her sealskin and bundled it into a hidden bag. When she awoke, she saw that she couldn't return to the water, and she had no choice but to go home with the powerful chieftain before her.

They got married and had a son, who they named Asgeir. This son grew into a strapping young lad, but he noticed that his mother was never happy. She would sit on a rock at the beach and gaze longingly toward the horizon. Asgeir wondered why she was so forlorn, not realizing that she pined for her old home.

During her captivity, Eyfridh's only friend was a woman named Ginna, who regularly came down from the forest to keep Eyfridh company on the beach. Ginna was another of the island's mystical beings. From the front, she was every bit as lovely as Eyfridh. But when Ginna turned around to return to the woods, Eyfridh saw a furry tail swishing behind her and a back as hollow as a dead tree. Eyfridh decided to ask about this, and Ginna explained that she was a type of *vættir* called a huldra.

During this conversation, Eyfridh let slip that she herself wasn't human, and that Valbrand had captured her from the sea. Ginna was horrified at this. The next day, while the chieftain was leading a raid on a nearby island, Ginna slipped into his longhouse and observed the exact nook where Valbrand had hidden the sealskin. She reported this to Eyfridh, who vanished that night and was never seen again. The boy Asgeir missed his mother from then on, but he hoped she was somewhere that she could be happier.

Years later, when Asgeir was a man, he ventured through the forest and met Ginna. As a supernatural creature of the wild, the huldra had not aged a day, and she noted that Asgeir looked remarkably similar to her old friend Eyfridh. He explained that that was his mother, and asked if Ginna had any idea where Eyfridh had gone. Ginna explained that Eyfridh was a selkie who Valbrand had kidnapped and who had run away to return to her old home. Asgeir was shocked that his father would do something so cruel, but now he had context for why his mother had always been so sad. He took further comfort in knowing that she was indeed happier now.

Upon returning home, Asgeir realised that he'd taken a liking to the ethereally beautiful being he'd met. But he was concerned about wooing her because he didn't want to wrench her from her home like Valbrand had done to Eyfridh. Asgeir decided to go about courting Ginna more respectfully. He brought lunch to a clearing in the woods and called Ginna over to dine with him. That date went well, so they continued their courtship every day at noon. Eventually, they'd grown comfortable enough with each other that Asgeir invited Ginna to spend the night at the chieftain's longhouse. At supper, it took all of Ginna's self-control not to throttle the ageing chieftain Valbrand for what he'd done to her friend, but she stayed her hand because killing him would give Asgeir and the other mortals too much trouble.

Several years later, Asgeir and Ginna married and had a child of their own together, a daughter named Ingileif who strongly resembled her mother. Ingileif's parents never told her about her supernatural heritage. But Valbrand's thralls who cared for the girl passed down legends of the vættir and Aes Sídhe until the old chieftain died and Asgeir freed all his father's thralls. Eventually, once Ingileif had grown and Asgeir himself was beginning to age, he took his daughter to the shore and introduced her to her grandmother Eyfridh.

""Hello again, Mother,"" Asgeir called out to the sea. ""I have grown now!""

A seal swam to the beach and shed its skin to reveal a human form. Looking on in amazement, Ingileif excitedly cried, ""It's a selkie! The stories were true!""

Having never met Ingileif before, Eyfridh initially thought she was looking at her old friend Ginna. ""How do you not recognise me?...Wait a minute, you *are* Ginna the hollow-backed huldra, right?""

Puzzled, Ingileif turned to her father and declared: ""This Sídhe is bananas, I ain't no hollow back girl!""","Centuries ago, on a remote island in the North Atlantic...",574

As he reaches the outskirts of town, his stomach grumbles.

He tatters around the car for any food but there isn't any, he looks back to the road in desolation only to find the solution to his problem just ahead on the byway: A special themed diner called ""Rockin' Rolls"", apparently famous for the best sausage rolls in the state.

The man parks his car on the foot of a hill, following the sign, there are other people arriving, they apparently ran into the same situation as he did, so they start making their way to the restaurant. He befriends a couple as they trek up through the dark dirt roads and the woman is the first to scream, out of the bushes a group of junkies flail blades at them and demand their wallets and phones, they comply.

The man is devastated, but the couple suggests they hurry up and get to the restaurant to use the owner's phone and report the crime. As they hike, they start talking about the show and eventualy all three are confident enough to smoke one in front of eachother, easing the trauma they just went through.

However, just as they reach the restaurant, they see a gang of bikers walking out and the man, at this point high off his face, starts laughing at one of the biker's walrus-like mustache, the bikers push the woman aside and beat the two men into the ground, breaking bones and bloodying their clothes. The man and his friend struggle up and with much hardship make it to the restaurant's doors, where they're met by the owner himself.

The man immediatly starts ranting about what a terrible hike up it was to get to the restaurant, to which the owner simply smiles and says:

The man decides to save the buttercups and he gently removes the ball and takes a drop and a penalty stroke. Just then, from a puff of smoke, Mother Nature appears in all her glory. She tells the golfer that because he was so protective of nature and saved the buttercups from destruction for his reward he will get all the butter he can eat for the rest of his life free of charge.

The old farmer nodded politely, apologized, and went about his chores.

A short time later, the old farmer heard loud screams, looked up, and saw the drugs squad officer running for his life, being chased by the farmer's big ferocious-looking bull...

With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.

The old farmer threw down his tools, ran to the fence and shouted at the top of his lungs...

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  &gt; &gt; Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

&amp;#x200B;

One student wrote the following:

&amp;#x200B;

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving.  As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.  Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

&amp;#x200B;

This gives two possibilities:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

&amp;#x200B;

So which is it?

&amp;#x200B;

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.  The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting 'Oh my God.'",I think this is pretty well-known but people on this sub seem to like reposts so here y'all go:,17

From his first day, it was obvious that he wasn't a good fit for this particular firm. But the firm signed a contract with his school so they had to keep him there for at least a month.

By the end of the third week, all the paid employees were so sick of the unpaid student that they began taking out their frustrations on each other.

One day, the student walked into the conference room to find the two managing partners in the middle of a violent fist fight.

""Whoa whoa whoa, guys,"" the student said getting between the two partners. ""Why is there so much hostility around here?""

The senior partner looked at him and said ""Intern! You're making us fucking hostile!""",A joke for old school metalheads,1

The man is skeptical at first, but he's so horny so he gives the man 100 bucks and runs up to the camel. 

As he gets to the camel, he stands there confused, then proceeds to touch the camel around and trying to place his penis inside her. The camel reacts for the first 10 minutes, but after a while, the man manages to stick his penis inside the camel and starts to have intense sex with her.

The hour goes by and he returns to the PIMP all happy and smiley. ""Bro, did you see how crazy that was?! I was hesitant at first but damn, the camel and I went CRAZY up there! Is she like that with everyone?""

While he's not even halfway through his beer, the other guests suddenly scurry away, not even bothering to finish their drinks nor their conversations. At the same time, the bartender frantically starts to take down and secure all bottles of booze, obviously looking to close down shop in a hurry. 

Our traveling stranger, bewildered, asks the bartender what's going on that has everyone so panicky. He answers: ""You really haven't heard? You must be from out of town. Everyone from around here knows that the black knight is coming!"". And with that, he disappears to a back section of the bar and barricades the door behind him. 

Just moments after finding himself in this suddenly empty bar, a big black man walks into the bar. In fact, big is quite the understatement; he's absolutely enormous. He's about 7""2 tall, has broad shoulders and muscular arms that give him a wingspan not unlike that of an Andean condor. Comically, the man is wearing black platform boots and a black top hat, making him look even bigger than he already is. Finishing his apparel are black pants, a black belt and a black shirt. The man - with the sort of strut as if he owned the place - walks straight towards the traveler, unzips his pants, whips out a massive dong and says in a deep commanding voice ""blow me"".

Mister traveler happens to be a heterosexual man, and even has a wife and two young kids at home. However, fearing what might happen to him if he refuses, he reluctantly complies. He starts working the tip slowly, but before long our antagonist spurs him to go ""faster, faster"". And so he does. Still not pleased with the pace of the performance, the black man keeps yelling ""faster, faster!"" another five times. After literally gobbling up and down as fast as he possibly can and hearing the repeated comment yet again, he starts losing his cool. He stops altogether, takes the dick out of his mouth and retorts: ""I've had it with you. I've been going as fast as I could and somehow you stíll want me to go faster. What's your big hurry anyways? "". To which the black man replies: ""What do you mean what's the hurry? Have you seriously not heard that the black knight is coming?!"".",[NSFW] The black knight,4

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, “I’m sorry, Ma’am, but your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.”

The distressed woman wailed, “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,” replied the vet.

“How can you be so sure?” she protested. “I mean, you haven’t done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.”

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck’s owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room.

A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, “I’m sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.”

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck’s owner, still in shock, took the bill. “$150!” she cried, “$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!”

The vet shrugged, “I’m sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it’s now $150.”",A woman brought a very limp duck to a veterinary surgeon...,66

post,bbo15h,2qh72,jokes,false,1554913635,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bbo15h/no_place_like_home/,self.jokes,,"     Tom had lived in New York City for 30 years now. As he looked out the window of his office suite, he realized it was Christmas Eve.  

     He had been so absorbed with the company business and without a family of his own, had really not been paying attention to the holidays. As he stared at the warmly clad figures below scurrying away with their packages and bags back to their families and loves ones, Tom realized he hadn’t spent Christmas with his parents in over 20 years.  “Maybe next year” he would always tell his mom on the phone, and the years just piled up and drifted by. But not this year, Tom decided. Tom was going to go back to his small, mid-western home town for Christmas. His parents weren’t getting any younger and he decided this was finally the year he would surprise them for Christmas.  Plus, it would be good to see the old town. 

     He rushed home from the office after leaving early from work that day, bought tickets for that night for the 2 hour flight and the 1 hour bus ride, and got off the bus just as the snow was starting to fall on the quiet, tree- lined streets of the small town he had wanted so desperately to escape. Now though, he realized, this was the only place where he might actually feel comfortable and loved. 

     As he stood outside the bus depot admiring the snowfall, a taxi pulled up and rolled its window down. “Tom, is that you?” It was Bert, his childhood friend, who now owned a chain of taxis in the area.  “Bert, I can’t believe your here! Hey, can you give me a ride?” Bert replied, “For you on Christmas Eve, absolutely! I’ll never forget the way you and your parents just welcomed me and took care of me when we were kids. Climb on in.” 

     Once Tom settled in with his luggage, Bert asked him where he wanted to go.  At that moment, Tom caught a glimpse of a bright flashing light, and realized it was the sign for Ruthy’s 24- Hour Dinner where he had spent many happy hours working as a bus boy in high school.  Suddenly he could taste the malts and fries of his childhood and exclaimed, “To Ruthy’s!” I’ll buy you a piece of pie!” “Fantastic!” replied Bert. 

     They drove on over and parked right outside the main door. As Tom got out of the taxi and walked up to the door, he was flooded by memories of this wonderful place and the boisterous Ruthy herself.  As Tom opened the door, he looked around, and there she was - Ruthy! A little older, but still fiery. “ Well I’ll be! Thomas, is that you? All grown up? I haven’t seen you in 20 years! Look at you in your fancy New York suit.  Come over here and give your Auntie Ruthy a hug.” Ruthy squeezed the breath out of Tom, but he didn’t mind, he was just happy to see her doing so well. 

     “Tommy, what would you like? It’s on the house. Merry Christmas.” Tom declared, “Ruthy, I couldn’t possibly take your food for free on Christmas Eve.” Ruthy gave a sigh and said, “ Tom, it’s a Christmas gift just to get to see you and remember all the good times you spent working here- we had a great staff! So what’ll it be?” Tom thought, but only for a second, as he remembered his favorite dish like it was yesterday. “I’ll take the eggs benedict and a piece of pie for Bert!” “Ahhh,” said Ruthy, “ your favorite! Coming right up!” 

     Ruthy went into he back, and Tom and Bert chatted about memories spent in the diner and of their lives since then.  They paused to look out the window and it struck Tom then how lucky he was to be in this diner, in this small town.  

     Ruthy came out of the kitchen after about 15 minutes with a fresh piece of pie, and the eggs benedict. As she set the benedict down, Tom realized that instead of being served on a plate, Ruthy has put the benedict on a hub cap. “Ruthy,” Tom asked, giving her a puzzled look, “ why are my eggs on a hub cap?” “Tom,” Ruthy declared , “ EVERYBODY knows there is no place like chrome for the hollandaise.”",No place like home...,5

After months of enduring his foul language and sexual innuendoes in class, the girls one day get together before class and decide, if today, Eddy says anything even remotely sexual or offensive, we will all get up at the same time and walk out in protest.

Class starts and the teacher says: ""OK kids, today's subject will be buildings and construction. Who can tell me how buildings are made?""

The class remains quiet, then little Eddy raises his hand and says ""Madam, I know"".

The teacher says, ""OK Eddy, please explain.""

Eddy: ""Well, first before anything you need a permit from the city for the construction project to begin, that could take months. Once you get the permit, then come the bulldozers to basically dig into the earth to create the foundation. Then, cement is poured into the foundation and pylons are inserted. Around the pylons, the outer structure of the building is made, floors, walls, ceilings.Then comes wiring and plumbing. Next drywall can be installed along with flooring and fixtures. When all is said and done, you still have to get an occupancy permit from the city before you can actually use the building.

The class remains quiet.

The teacher says: WOW Eddy! Bravo, that was amazing, how did you learn all that?

Eddy: For the past many months, just a few doors down from our house, they have been building what I think is a huge whore house, I've watched the whole thing from start to finish.

At that moment, all the girls suddenly get up and start to walk out.

Eddy looks around and says:

He wakes up in the middle of the night, sees an angel standing at the foot of his bed.

Angel says, ""Hey, man! Yeah... hate to tell you this, but, um... it's your, uh... time. Yeah.""

Dude's all like, ""Wait, what? Whaddya mean it's 'my time'?""

Angel says, ""Oh, you know... it's, um... your time.""

Dude's like ""Wait, you mean, like, time to die?!""

Angel's like, ""Um... yeah! That."" 

Dude starts freakin' out, and he's all like, ""No no, please no! Come on bro, I got a wife, I got kids, I got a life to live! I can't die yet!""

Angel says, ""Look man, I feel for you. Really I do, but if They say it's your time, then I can't really do anything ab-""

Dude cuts him off all like, ""Ah, come on bro, please... I'll take anything you got, I just don't want to die yet.""

Angel thinks for a hot second, then says, ""...alright man. I guess there is *one* thing I *can* do.""

Dude's all like, ""What is it!? I'll take anything, man.""

Angel says, ""Welp. It's been a while, and it's a little wonky, but...""

Angel clears his throat, continues, ""...I can bring you back as either a dog, or a chicken. Best I can do.""

Dude thinks about this in his head, ""*well, if I'm a dog, I gotta be somebody's pet, or guard, or guide, or mystery meat. Nah, I don't want that. But hey, if I'm a chicken, I can chillax at some farm on the quiet countryside... yeah, that sounds more my speed.""*

Dude's all like, ""Well, if I have to choose one, I guess I choose to be the chicken.""

Angel's all like, ""alright, cool."" and snaps his fingers. 

POOF!

Dude is suddenly a chicken at some random farm, and sees a bunch of other chickens clucking around the farmyard.

Dude's all like, ""Um.... hey, wassup everybody.""

This random chicken (which I will, from here on, refer to as ""Hype Chicken"") is all like,

""WhAT! WHAt!?!?! We gOt a NEw chicKeN iN the cOOP!!!!!""

All the other chickens are all like, ""WOOT!!!!""

Dude's like, ""Um, yeah...""

He then points at himself and chuckles,

""So, yeah. First time being a chicken, so... what exactly am I supposed to do as a chicken?""

Hype chicken's all like, ""dude, Dude. ALL you have to do as a chicken is, like, lay eggs. That's, like, it.""

Dude's like, ""Alright, cool. How exactly do I do that?""

Hype chicken's all like, ""Dude, like, all you have to do is, like, push, and the egg will pop right out, yeah. You got this!""

Dude's all like, ""K. I got this, here goes.""

He pushes, and boom. Egg pops right out.

Hype chicken's all like, ""woah, WHAt!?! WhAt!?!?!!?! DUDE. JUST. LAID. HIS. FIRST. EGG!!!!! WOOT!!!!!!!""

The rest of the chickens join in with a solid, ""WOOT!!!!!!""

Hype chicken's like, ""dude, DUDE. You should, like, totally go for your second one! Yeah? Yeah.""

Dude's under pressure and everything, but still all like, ""Alright, yeah, I gotchu fam. Here goes.""

He pushes, and he pushes, and boom. Second egg pops right out.

Hype chicken flips out all like, ""WoAh, wHAt?!?! whAAAAt?!?!?!!?!?!? DUDE JUST LAID HIS SECOND EGG!!!! wOooOOoT!!!!!

Hype chicken is joined the second time by the other chickens with a resounding, ""WOOT!!!!!""

Hype chicken then abruptly goes silent, causing all the others to do to the same.

""Dude.""

Hype chicken, with a look that portrays pride, hope, and determination, stands for a moment, and then quietly continues.

""Go for your THIRD.""

The chickens make a circle, encompassing the dude and Hype chicken. 

What begins as a soft whisper, escalates into mighty, unified shout with a thundering rhythm.

""third, Third, THird! THIrd! THIRd!, THIRD! THIRD!! THIRD!!!""

Dude doesn't want to let his new friends down, so he takes a deep breath, and stands tall.

He pushes,

And he pushes,

And he pushes,

And

Boom.

Third egg pops right out.

""WOOOOOOoooOOOOoooOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Hype chicken and the rest are fluttering everywhere, freaking out, and wooting like nobody's business.

Dude's just standing there.

Taking it all in.

He's feeling the love.

He's feeling the hype.

When, all of a sudden,

He hears a voice,

Screaming

In his ear.....

There were these two elderly people living in a Florida mobile home park. He was a widower and she a widow. They had known each other for a number of years. Now, one evening there was a community supper in the big activity center. These two were at the same table, across from one another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring glances at her and finally gathered up his courage to ask her, ""Will you marry me?""

After a dramatic pause and precisely six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered. ""Yes. Yes, I will.""

The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges and they went to their respective places.

Next morning, he was troubled. ""Did she say 'yes' or did she say 'no'?""

He couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just could not recall. Not even a faint memory. With trepidation, he went to the telephone and called her.

First, he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as he used to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past. As he gained a little more courage, he then inquired of her, ""When I asked if you would marry me, did you say 'Yes' or did you say 'No'?""

He was delighted to hear her say, ""Why, I said, 'Yes, yes I will' and I meant it with all my heart.""

Then she continued, ""And I am so glad that you called, because I couldn't remember who had asked me.""",Will you marry me...,17

One day Eddie walked into the patent office. He boldly stated to the patent officer, Bob, that he’d like to patent the apple. Bob, a studious man who looked like he spent a lifetime burying his face in books, dryly pointed out “You can’t patent the apple, Johnny Appleseed already did that.”  
“Well” Eddie said, “ I think you should try mine.” pulling out a shiny green apple. “Take a bite of this!”

The patent officer, being a tempered man by nature, reluctantly took the apple from Eddie’s hand and cautiously took a bite. His eyes slowly widened giving way to an expression of confusion.  “This tastes like kiwi.” 

Eddie giving a knowing nod, points and says,  “Take a bite out of the other side.” 

Bob slowly turns the apple over and takes another bite. Again his eyes widen, “It tastes like strawberry!” 
 “Yes sir!” Eddie emphatically affirms. “Here. try another one”, handing another apple for the patent officer to try. Sure enough, Bobs confusion began to give way to incredulity as he took a bite of an apple that tasted like banana.  

“Turn it over” replies Eddie. 

“It tastes like watermelon!”Bob leans back in his chair,” How do you do this?” Bob said, his furrowed brow and slight tilt of his head indicating his curiosity was piqued. 

Eddie smiles, “Try this one” 

Another bite and Bob is surprised again. “Cantaloupe?“

“Try the other side!” Eddie laughed. 

“Honey dew? You may really be on to something here.“ Bob admits, turning the apple slowly with his fingertips, 

“Well that’s nothing”. Eddie winks, leaning in as if telling a secret ”I’ve got one that tastes like pussy. 
“What!?” Bob is incredulous as he quickly leans forward and glances around the office to see if anyone else heard his reaction. He leans in a bit more, and says with a lowered voice, “That’s one I’d like to try”. 

Eddie hands him a shiny red apple. Bob, (who’s prudish wife of 23 yrs. would never allow such savagery) raises the Apple slowly up to his mouth, his deepest fantasies finally coming to fruition. The anticipation of the crisp crunch of the apple and the taste of “forbidden” juices flowing in his mouth and down his chin...he felt a primal rush, tilting his head back, closing his eyes, biting deeply, passionately, into the apple. Within a split second his head rocks forward, eyes popping open and he quickly spit out the chunk of apple in total disgust. “Blehhhhk.” Bob gags, hurriedly wiping his sleeve across his chin and glaring at Eddie. “That tastes like shit!!!”

Eddie, gesturing with his hand, excitedly responds, “Right!Turn it over!”",The apple of your dreams.,20

The bus driver overheard Jeff's attempts and decided to let him in on a secret.

""She prays at the cemetery every night at midnight. So what you do is...""

The bus driver's plan was perfect. Jeff would dress up as an angel, and when the nun went to pray at the cemetary he would jump out and tell her God wanted them to have sex.

So jeff went to the cemetary and sure enough around midnight, he saw the silhouette of a nun walk in and kneel by one of the gravestones. He jumped out at her and said,

""The lord has sent me here because he wants you to experience sex.""

The nun was bewildered at first but then replied,

""Alright, but can we do anal so that I keep my virginity?""

Jeff agreed and they started going at it. A few minutes in, Jeff couldn't contain his excitement, ripped off his angel mask and said, 

""Haha! I'm actually the guy from the bus earlier today!""

Then the nun turned to him, ripped off her mask and said,

They were out in the middle of a lake and the fish were biting. They were talking together about whatever came to mind, and between that and the regular strikes at their lines, didn’t notice that storm clouds had crept up from behind until one of them heard the rumbling.

They immediately started furiously rowing to shore, but got caught in a torrential downpour before they could moor the boat and take cover.

John cursed the rain with an off-hand religious oath. Ed was shocked and chided him, “Don’t you know, John, that God could cause it to rain without stopping ‘til all of us had drowned?”

He can see from her nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack.

""Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a vacation.""

Patricia looks at the frog in disbelief and asks his name.

The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay, because he knows the bank manager.

Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.

The frog says, ""Sure. I have this,"" and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office!

She finds the manager and says, ""There's a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000, and he wants to use this as collateral.""

She holds up the tiny pink elephant. ""I mean, what in the world is this?""

There she stands with this little pink porcelain elephant asking the bank manager about a loan to Kermit Jagger (who is a frog and claims that Mick Jagger the singer in the Rolling Stones is his father). And that little green reptile wants a $30,000.00 loan!!!

So Patty repeats her question: “What in the world is this thing that the little reptile wants to use as collateral?”

(Get ready for this)

The bank manager looks back at her and says...

""It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone.""

By his fourth birthday, he already had 30 tractors of different sizes and colours.

As soon as he learnt how to read, he started filling his shelves in his bedroom with books about tractors. Harry Ferguson was his hero. He knew everything about his life and the tractors he invented.

His room had become a temple dedicated to tractors. Carpet, duvet, cushions, lamp, curtain, posters: everything was covered with tractors.

For his tenth birthday, his parents brought him to a farm for an incredible surprise. He was going to drive a real tractor with the help of Joe the farmer.

What a thrill! He'd never been this excited in his life. They started driving together. The little boy was so happy. This was the best day of his life.
After driving for an hour, Joe the farmer said: ""Now i'm going to let you have a try on your own"".
He brought him in the middle of a field and let him drive on his own.

Slowly the tractor started moving.
""Well done!"" said Farmer Joe. ""Try going a little bit faster now""
The tractor went faster but something was wrong. The motor was making a strange sound. Suddenly the brakes stopped working and the inevitable happened: they crashed into a tree and the tractor turned over. The boy was ejected from the tractor and saw Joe the farmer die, crushed by the weight of his massive tractor.

The boy broke his arm and was sent to the hospital. He was traumatised. When he arrived home, he took off of his wall all the posters, threw away anything with a tractor on it and no one ever mentioned the word tractor around him ever since.

The boy grew up. He turned eighteen. One day, he was invited at a party. He drank a few beers, chatted with some friends and talked with a pretty girl. She was tipsy and after half an hour she made a move and started kissing him.
Suddenly someone shouted ""something's burning in the oven!"" A girl removed a burnt pizza  from the oven. However, the room was still full of smoke.

The couple stopped kissing. The pretty girl said: ""we can barely see anything! There's so much smoke!""

""Don't worry"", said the boy, ""I'll fix it"" He got up and opened his mouth wide and started sucking up all the smoke from the room. He left the house and blew out all the smoke outside.
When he re-entered, the girl asked him, ""How did you do that?""

He replied, ""I'm an extractor fan"".",There was once a little boy,126

The child named Ninety grew up to be a strict person with an average job and life. She got married and had 3 children, all of which were mischevious and often got into trouble. They became very clever. 
One day, they were walking back from school together, when they noticed an old dog on the side of the road slowly approaching them. There was no collar or sign of it already being someone's pet, and feeling pity for it, they took it to their house. Although the dog was very sweet, the children knew that their mom would never allow them to keep a dog, so they decided to name it “This”. That way, they could talk about the dog without their mom knowing, like “have you checked on This?” or “we have to wash This today.” They took care of the lovely old dog for about a year or two without their mom realizing. Then, on one tragic morning, they discovered that This had died. They wept as they buried her body, but there was nobody to tell, because

He was a fair student, but not great, and after several years of study, he graduated with a C average and was assigned as part of a job-placement program to a route in Manhattan. He loved his new job and everything was great for a while until one day he wasn't paying very close attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River. All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore. He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive.

He settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene.

This time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him.

In the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution. He was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health.

Flummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited.

The eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine.

The warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power….

Harry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?”

Harry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”","All his life, Harry wanted to be a cable-car operator...",5

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",26

“Look man. When I was born my mother passed away. Apparently it was too much pain and she could not take it. My father was not the by best so I always wished it was him that died”

So the husband asks :

“why are you telling me this?”

The doctor Replies:

“It’s because your wife will not make it through the pain. But I am a part-time scientist so I made a machine that transfers the pain telepathically to the father. We can control how much you receive.”

So the husband agrees and they set the machine up. 

They first try out the LOW setting. The man feels no pain what so ever, and the wife feels less pain. So the doctor puts it on the MEDIUM setting. Still no pain on the man and the woman feels way better. As the doctor sees she isn’t being affected, he puts the machine on DEATH setting. The man feels no pain and neither does the woman.

Now, for his entire life, Phil was best friends with his next door neighbor. Let's call her Jane. They grew up at  eachother's houses, practically. When girls and guys saw each other as icky, they stayed friends. Later, when they both started dating other people, they never even considered eachother. They were just too close already. They went through life, growing up but never apart.

Eventually, their senior year of high school arrived. Jane was incredibly excited to go to prom with her boyfriend, right until he dumped her just a month before for the local bimbo. Jane was heartbroken. Phil, being the good friend that he was, saw a need to cheer her up. Himself being single, he decided to ask her to go with him, just as friends. For the first time since the breakup, Phil saw a smile on Jane's face when he asked. It was a date.

Phil, still being the good friend he was, decided that Jane should have the best senior prom anyone could have. With prom fast approaching, he had to prepare. He started by going to pick up tickets. He ran into a bit of traffic on the way there, but eventually he reached the school on the day tickets began being sold. When he arrived, his heart sank. The line stretched out the door, and it looked like only 1 person was at the booth. But Phil thought of Jane, strengthened his resolve, and waited. Phil waited, and waited, and waited until at long last he reached the front of the line. He bought the tickets, and went home.

The next day, Phil went to get Jane a corsage. He went all the way downtown to the florist's, where a horrible sight met his eyes. Once again, a line stretched around the block. Phil knew it was the only high quality florist's in town, however, and bunkered down. Phil waited, and waited, and waited, and eventually made it inside and bought the very last corsage. He went home.

The next day, Phil decided to rent a tux. He went to the local tailor's, where once again a line like no other stretched out the door and around the block. Apparently they were having a sale, or something. It's a joke. Stop analyzing. Point is, Phil once again waited, and waited, and waited, until at long last he could be fitted for a suit. He rented it, and, after waiting through rush hour for the second time that day, went home. The next day was the day before prom. Yes, that means Phil has been skipping school all week to wait in lines. Don't question the power of friendship. Phil checked his wallet, then his bank account, then his sock drawer, then under his bed. After pooling all of his resources, Phil found he had just enough to rent a limo. It was a lot of money for a guy like Phil, but he knew how happy it would make Jane, and that was enough for him. So, he went to the limo rental place as soon as they opened. Sadly, everyone else had the same idea. It looked like some people had even camped out overnight. Phil almost wanted to quit, but he thought of Jane's smile when he asked her to go with him, and how down she had been for the past month. He sighed, and passed the time reminiscing over all the memories they had shared as he waited, and waited, and waited. He got to the front, thoroughly fed up with lines by now, and ordered the last limo on the lot for the next evening. Then, he went home.

The next day, at long last, was prom. Phil was ready for the whole ordeal to be over, just as I'm sure you are with this joke. It's funny, I promise. He was a bit grumpy, but that all changed when he saw Jane. She was stunning in her prom dress, and looked happier than he could remember. She was amazed by the limo, thought the corsage was lovely, and complimented his tux. It was all going perfectly, until the limo driver asked where to. Phil's heart sunk. He forgot to make dinner reservations. He turned to Jane with a sheepish look and explained. She laughed it off, and told the limo driver to head to the nearest McDonald's.

Surprise, the joke was an advertisement the whole time! Just kidding.

Dinner was as good as McDonald's could be on prom night, which admittedly wasn't saying much, but soon it was time for prom to begin. Jane and Phil headed over to it, where another line greeted them. Apparently, the bimbo and Jane's ex had tried slipping in with an entire keg of beer, resulting in patdowns and drug dogs guarding the door. But, they waited, and waited, and waited, and eventually made it through.

At long last, Prom had arrived. They had a good time, dancing with their friends and enjoying the night, until a slow song came on. As casual dates, Phil and Jane danced together, when suddenly, it hit Phil. He realized he had always been in love with Jane, since the moment they met. All the late night talks, all the inside jokes, play fights, and real fights. Phil wouldn't trade a moment of it for anything. He knew he had to tell her.

So he leaned in, and whispered in her ear. He talked about all the time they'd spent together, all their favorite memories. Their mistakes and successes, their hopes and dreams. And, finally Phil dropped the bomb. ""Jane,"" he began, ""I think I'm falling in love with you.""

Jane promptly fainted.

Phil, distraught, didn't know what to do. She was crowded; nobody seemed to notice her condition. Luckily, the song ended, leading several of the couples to break off from one another and notice both Jane in an unconscious slump on the floor and Phil having a panic attack right beside her. Soon enough, Jane's ex had appeared and was helping her to her feet. Phil, feeling the moment slipping away from him, looked around for anything he could do. ""Give her space!"" Someone yelled. ""Get her a drink!"" Someone else contended. Drink. A drink. Phil could do that. He pushed through the crowd, up to the punch table. And Phil began to cry. Because, despite his recent experiences leading one to expect otherwise, something was missing. Thank god, there wasn't a punch line.",There was once a guy named Phil,4

By some hocus pocus, you feel strong. So you can stick your left foot back in, and really shake it all about.

And that's really all it takes. Just give it time. With a little hocus pocus, soon you'll be able to put your right foot in, your left arm, right arm, your whole self in!""

A monk answers the door and greets him the man very curious about the sound asks what the sound is about. The monk says that the sound is coming from inside the monastery but he cannot tell him what is making the sound because you have to be a monk.

The monk replies that in he must continue his journey and count every leaf in the state before he can continue his journey to find the source of the sound.

This takes the man, now driven mad wanting to know the source of the sound, on his quest and returns after several years to the monastery to ask what is making the sound. The monk still denies him and puts him on his final quest before he will become and monk and be told where the sound is coming from. You must travel the entire country and count every blade of grass after that you may finally know what is making that sound.

FATHER: ""You bitch!""

MOTHER: ""You're a bastard!""

TOMMY: ""What do those words mean?""

The parents, flustered that Tommy heard that, wave it off by explaining that ""bitches and bastards"" really means ""ladies and gentlemen"".

Just then, the mail arrives through the letterbox and lands on the welcome mat. The father goes to examine them and is angry because they're all bills again. ""Ah shit!"" he is heard to cry.

TOMMY: ""What does shit mean?""

FATHER: ""Uh, doormat! Yes, it means doormat.""

He then excuses himself, for it is time to get ready for the party. Tommy follows him to the bathroom, where his father has started to shave. He accidentally cuts himself with his blunt razor and yells out ""Bollocks!""

TOMMY: ""What is bollocks?""

FATHER: ""Go away, it means chin.""

So Tommy returns to the kitchen where he finds his mother cutting up a cooked turkey for the party food. Unfortunately, she did not notice the placement of her knife and knocked it off the table.

MOTHER: ""Fucking hell.""

TOMMY: ""What does fucking mean?""

MOTHER: ""Never you mind, it means cutting. That's all.""

The guests finally arrive and guess who answers the door? Also guess who is ready to impress the guests with his new vocabulary?

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...
And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...
And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",A politician dies...,14
