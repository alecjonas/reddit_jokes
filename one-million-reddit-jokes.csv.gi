As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone 'Happy Birthday.’

I thought …. well, that's marriage for you, but the kids .... they will remember.

My kids came bouncing down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word.
So when I left for work I felt pretty low and somewhat dejected.

As I walked into my office, my hot boss, sam, said, 'Good morning, and by the way Happy Birthday!' It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock, when sam knocked on my door and said, 'It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.'

I said, 'Thanks, sam, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!'

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two red wines each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, sam said, 'It's such a beautiful day … we don't need to go straight back to work, do we?'

I responded, 'I guess not. What do you have in mind?'

She said, 'Let's drop by my place, it's just around the corner.

After arriving at her house, sam turned to me and said, 'If you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.'

'Ok.' I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake, followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing 'Happy Birthday.'

And I just sat there ....

They go through every city, until They asked the entire country, wich took 10 years.
Candy wants to give up. “ were gonna die of old are if we continue doing this!” But Cookie is still desperate to return the sock. Suddenly, something comes to the mind of Cookie.

“ there is a legend of the great all-seeing eye on the top of mount Everest. He sees and knows everything! One question may be asked by one person every 100 years, But it Will be worth it. “

Cookie and Candy climb the mountain, But because the all-seeing eye does’nt want to get everyone to ask him when fortnite is going to be released on Android, he set up dangerous things.

They climb through slippery walls, go over a bridge hanging over lava, and fight furious packs of Wolfs...

After a year long climb, They’re finally there. The all-seeing eye.

The all-seeing eye asks: “ Cookie and Candy, What question do you want me to answer “?

Cookie asks: “ Is this your sock? “",2 people walk across a street.,32

A few were stumbling, but one guy in particular was leaning on a wall while slowly making his way to his car. 

Falling over, crawling a bit, but eventually made it to his car. The cop almost went over to help because he was afraid he was gonna kill himself getting to his car as all the other patrons were leaving or gone. 

Finally getting to his car the man tried to use a lighter, his cell phone and even his wallet to unlock the car. During this time everyone else had left. Finally after dropping his keys three times he got in, and started it up.

The cop instantly turned on his sirens, and pulled the man over before he could get it out of park. The officer asked the man to get out where he administered every test in the book and to the cops surprise he passed with flying colors. That is until the cop pulled out the breathalyzer.

""One last test"" the officer said as he administered the breathalyzer. The man blew a 0.00, twice. The cop was shocked the man was barely able to function earlier.

""So what's going on?"" asked the officer.

""I got DD duty"" the man said

""Then why are you walking like a drunken highschooler instead of driving your buddies hom"" asked the cop

""There was more than twenty people, so I decided designated decoy was the better option, amd it looks like it worked."" The man said with a smirk.",Closing time at the bar.,28

Since they were low on beer, they decided to all come up with their lottery numbers and buy their tickets during the beer run.

The programmer created an interactive program, complete with simulated announcer reading each lottery number. He used the output to choose his numbers.

The chemist estimated the atomic weight of each lottery ball (since the amount of paint makes a difference) and combined it with the estimated mixing rate of a typical lottery machine.

The physicist painted numbers on ping pong balls and dropped them into cups to choose the numbers.

The statistician applied a sliding window regressive time series to the history of previous drawings. He saw a pattern and used it to identify the most likely numbers.

And the engineer chose his dog's age, belt size, and other arbitrary numbers that held sentimental meanings to him.

They got the beer and lottery tickets, and then watched the drawing.

""15"" said the announcer. Around the room, everyone reacted: Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Yes!

""28"" was the next number. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Yes!

""46!"" Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Yes!

and so on.

At the end, they compared results.

The programmer decided that there must be a bug in his code, because he didn't match any numbers.

The chemist also matches nothing, and decided it was due to the residual heat from the studio lighting.

The physicist matched one number, but thought it might be dumb luck.

The engineer managed to match 2 numbers, but it wasn't enough to win anything.

And then they all looked at the statistician who was grinning like the Cheshire cat.

""So how did you do,"" asked the engineer?

The statistician beamed. ""I was well within the standard deviation!""",An engineer threw a party for all of his friends.,10

He has an unusual habit -  whenever he performs a circumcision, he saves the foreskin and adds it to a big pile in his closet. One day he looks at the huge pile of foreskins and says to himself, ""These foreskins are just sitting here. I should do something with them."" So the mohel gathers them all up and takes them to a tailor.

The mohel shows the foreskins to the tailor and asks if he can make something out of them. The tailor thinks about it for a moment, then tells the mohel to come back in a week.

A week goes by, and the mohel returns to the tailor. ""So, what did you make me?"" the mohel asks. The tailor goes into the back room, comes back, and hands the mohel a wallet. 

The mohel can't believe it - he's stunned. He exclaims, ""I gave you 50 years of foreskins - a huge pile of foreskins! And all you can make from them is a wallet? I don't understand!""

The tailor responds, ""Don't worry, don't worry - just rub it for five minutes and it turns into a set of matching luggage!""

Take it out on someone you don’t know, but you know deserves it. I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I’d forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying “Hello.”

I politely said, “This is Rick. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?” Suddenly, a manic voice yelled out in my ear, “Get the right fucking number!” and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn’t believe that anyone could be so rude. When I tracked down Robyn’s correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the wrong number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, “You’re an asshole!” and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word “asshole” next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I’d call him up and yell, “You’re an ass!” It always cheered me up.

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic asshole calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, “Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. I’m calling to see if you’re familiar with our Caller ID Program?” He yelled “NO!” and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, “That’s because you’re an asshole!” and hung up.

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I’d been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a For Sale sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.

A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole, I thought that I’d better call the BMW asshole, too. I said, “Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?” He said, “Yes, it is.” I then asked, “Can you tell me where I can see it?” He said, “Yes, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. It’s a yellow ranch style house, and the car’s parked right out in front.” I asked, “What’s your name?” He said, “My name is Don Hansen.” I asked, “When’s a good time to catch you, Don?” He said, “I’m home every evening after five.” I said, “Listen, Don, can I tell you something?” He said, “Yes?” I said, “Don, you’re an asshole!” Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. Then I came up with an idea… I called asshole #1. He said, “Hello.” I said, “You’re an asshole!” but I didn’t hang up. He asked, “Are you still there?” I said, “Yeah!” He screamed, “Stop calling me!” I said, “Make me.” He asked, “Who are you?” I said, “My name is Don Hansen.” He said, “Yeah? Where do you live?” I said, “asshole, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. A yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.” He said, “I’m coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.” I said, “Yeah, like I’m really scared, asshole” and hung up.

Then I called asshole #2. He said, “Hello?” I said, “Hello, asshole.” He yelled, “If I ever find out who you are…” I said, “You’ll what?” He exclaimed, “I’ll kick your ass!” I answered, “Well, asshole, here’s your chance. I’m coming over right now.”

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oak Tree Blvd in Fairfax.

I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. I got there just in time to watch the two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. NOW I feel much better.“

""Great,"" replies the clickbait journalist. ""I use words to make my living, and I know how to ask the right questions.""

Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress.

He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, while he is halfway down the hall when he sees three newly inducted nuns from other city heading his way.

Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue.

The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.

Startled, he drops a bar of soap.

""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"".

To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice, and three times but nothing happens.

So she gives several more tugs, then yells:

Deciding to try to use her looks to get ahead and get better grades she visited each of her male professors. She had three. 

She visited the first one. After flirting a bit and getting some good reaction she decided to flash him. He seemed happy and liked them. Confident that he would raise her grade now she returned to her dorm and waited. No change in grade. 

So she decided to try again. She went to her second professor, flirted, then ended up flashing again. This time she asked him if he will raise her grade. He said no and she left. 

She went to the third professor and flirted then flashed him too. He seemed unimpressed. She finally broke down. She felt like she had just flashed these men for nothing and now regretted it. She told the professor how she felt bad exposing herself for nothing and asked why they wouldn’t raise her grades. 

The teacher replied, “ you may feel bad about exposing yourself for nothing. You may feel bad about your bad grades. You may be asking why it won’t work” 

She replied, “I’m waiting for the but” 

He replied “So are we”.

So there's this fly hovering  few inches above this lake...

There's a fish in the lake thinking to himself ""if that fly were to drop a few inches I'd be able to eat the fly"".

But there's also a bear on the shore thinking to himself ""if that fly were to drop a few inches the fish would get the fly and I'd easily be able to eat the fish"".

And there's also this hunter up a hill near the shore thinking to himself "" if that fly were to drop a few inches the fish would eat the fly, the bear would eat the fish and the bear would be in a good place for me to shoot"".

But there's this mouse a little further up the hill hiding in a bush looking at some crackers next to the hunter and thinking to himself ""if that fly were to drop a few inches, the fish would eat the flu, the bear would eat the fish, Ye hunter would shoot the bear, and the hunter would be distracted enough for me to steal his crackers"".

And then there's this cat even further up the hill at the hunters cabin thinking to himself ""if that fly were to drop a few inches, the fish would eat the fly, the bear would eat the fish, the hunter would shoot the bear, the mouse will steal the crackers, and I'll be able to chase down that mouse"".

So what happened next you may be asking?

The fly dropped a few inches and the fish ate the fly, the bear ate the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the mouse stole the crackers, but when the cat started to chase the mouse, he slipped and rolled all the way down the hill and splashed into the lake!

What's the moral of the story?

When a fly drops a few inches... pussy gets wet.",So there's this fly hovering a few inches above this lake...,31

So,  the man decides to try the first hole. He pays his $20, slips into the hole,  and feels someone on the other side go to sucking. After 10 minutes,  he pops off a nut. 

 Thinking that wasn't bad,  he goes for the 2nd hole,  and after 5 m8nutes, he pops off another one. 

 After recovering for a few minutes,  he decides,  against the farmer's advice,  to try the 3rd hole. He ends up being there for hours,  unable to free himself. 

Once he's loose, and in bad shape,  he asks the farmer what the hell's behind the wall.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

""Yes, Alfred? What do you need?"" answers his lord.

""I am sorry for this interuption but I've found some monkey that is up on one of the palm trees we have planted in our garden recently, milord."" explained himself Alfred.

Lord sighs, closes his book and looks up on Alfred, then he says: ""That isn't good. It could get into the mansion and destroy something or some activists could bothers up. Very well, Alfred. Go and find our hunter, Mr. Roggers, explain him the situation and assists him if he requires as such. Also, make sure to not kill the monkey, we don't want any attention from activists or news.""

""Yes, milord."" says Alfred and then hurries to find Mr. Roggers.

Soon enough Alfred finds Mr. Roggers and explain the situation to him after which Mr. Roggers leaves for a few moments to check out the situation on his own telling Alfred to stay inside in the meantime.

When Mr. Roggers returns he starts preparing things for the capture. One baton, one cagelike trap, his dog and one rifle.

Alfred immediatelly says, when Mr. Roggers prepares his rifle: ""Milord specificly said to not kill the monkey."".

""I know, I know, Alfred. I am not gonna shoot the monkey. But tell me Alfred, do you know how to shoot with this type of rifle?"" asks Mr. Roggers.

""Of course I know that. Before you got hired I had to assume the role of the hunter sometimes. But I am not going to shoot the monkey either."" replies Alfred.

""Good, that makes it easier. Listen here Alfred, I am going to explain the plan A. You are going to take the rifle. My dog, BitesTheBalls, will be nearby and ready to go. And I am going to put the trap below the monkey and climb up the palm with baton. Then I am going to try to fling off the monkey with the baton. If it works the monkey will fall into the trap that will lock itself afterwards and we will be able to get it easily off the property in that cage."" explains his plan Mr. Roggers.

""So how are you going to use your dog, BitesTheBalls?"" asks a little bit puzzled Alfred.

""That for the plan B. You are going to take the rifle. BitesTheBalls, will be nearby and ready to go. And I am going to put the trap below the monkey and climb up the palm with baton. Then I am going to try to fling off the monkey with the baton. But the monkey doesn't fall into the trap, just on the ground. At that moment BitesTheBalls will be ready. I trained him to run up to any prey lying down on the ground to bite it in the balls and drag it into the trap. So BitesTheBalls will run up to the monkey, bite it in the balls and drag it by the balls into the trap."" Mr. Roggers proceeds to explain the plan B.

""And why do I have the rifle?"" asks the last question Alfred.

""That's for the plan C. You are going to take the rifle. BitesTheBalls, will be nearby and ready to go. And I am going to put the trap below the monkey and climb up the palm with baton. Then I am going to try to fling off the monkey with the baton. But I miss with the baton and fall down the palm tree myself.

The man calls upon the witch and relays his story. “Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help. Can anything be done to help me?

The man’s face lit up and he dashed off into the forest. He called out to the frog, “Will you marry me?”

The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, “NO.” The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter.

“WOW,” he screamed out loud, “This is great!!” But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again. “Frog, will you marry me?” the guy shouted. The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, “NO!” The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, “This is fantastic.” He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.

Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, “Frog will you marry me?”

""I know a few of the back alleys, my dear. Follow me."" assured the older nun.

As they got onto a straightaway with the convent in sight, the young nun pulled up beside the older nun to match her speed and proclaimed, ""I've never come this way before!""

As they enter the village they are suddenly surrounded by many men and women with spears. Fearing for their lives the two of the men start begging for the people not to hurt them and they are just there to learn about them and their culture. The third man seems to have accepted that he is totally fucked.

Suddenly the village chief steps out of a hut and says, ""Hello. We are cannibals. We are going to skin you alive and use your skin to make our canoes. Then we are going eat you.""

Again, two of the men start begging for their lives.

The chief interrupts, ""There is nothing you can say or do to stop this. However, we will grant you any final wish you would like, other than to be set free.""

The two men start panicking. The chief walks up to the first man and says, ""You have 30 seconds to tell me your wish.

The man's time is almost up, and he says, ""I want a knife.""

""Very well"" the chief says as he hands him the knife. The first man takes the knife. Not wanting to be skinned alive he slits his own throat.

The chief moves to the second man and gives him thirty seconds. He starts mumbling, trying to think of a way to save his ass. As his time expires he too asks for the knife. Fearing the pain of being skinned alive, he also cuts his own throat. 

The chief then moves to the third man who hasn't spoken word the whole time. 

The chief says, ""You have thirty…""

""I'll take a fork"" the third man interrupts loudly.

Confused by the request the chief gets a fork and brings it back to the man. 

The man takes the fork and starts stabbing himself all over his body, his chest, arms, legs, stomach. Then he screams,

Monday morning, he found himself paired with an attractive woman, Pat, who turned out to be a very good golfer. They started with a few casual bets, but by the back nine it was a full-blown competition. On the 18th green, Pat sank her long birdie putt for the win. Dave congratulated her and paid off his losses. Pat asked for a ride home and,on the way, told him, 'You know, Dave, I haven't enjoyed myself so much on the golf course in a long time. In fact, pull over so I can express my appreciation. 

He did, they kissed, and one thing led to another and soon she gave him the best oral sex he'd ever had. 


The next morning, they met again on the first tee and played together again. They had another magnificent day, enjoying each other's company and playing tight, competitive golf. Again Pat beat him, but she also showed her appreciation on the drive home. This went on all week, with Dave narrowly losing every day, his male ego bruised, but not unhappy. 

On Friday's drive home, Dave said, 'Pat, you've been great to be with all this week and tonight I'd like to return the favor. I made reservations at the best restaurant in town for us and reserved the 
penthouse suite at the best hotel. What do you say?' 

Pat burst into tears. 'I can't!' 

'What? Why not?' asked Dave. 

'Because,' she sobbed, 'I'm in the middle of a sex change and the doctor hasn't completed that part of me .... yet!' 


'What?!' Aghast, Dave swerved off the road, screeched to a stop and cursed madly, overcome with emotion. 

'I'm so sorry,' says Pat. 'You have a right to be angry with me.' 

'You bastard!' Dave screamed, his face bright red. 'You cheating bastard! All week long you've been playing off the women's tees",A weeks worth of golf,20

By the time the last Russian has gone home, the Christian's hat is overflowing with coins, and the Jew is as broke as he was at the start of the day.

The priest walks out of the church, drops a ruble into the Christian beggar's hat, and looks at the old Jew with pity. He crouches down, and asks him ""Why do you put yourself through this every week? You've been sitting here every week for years, and nobody ever gives you money. You get spat on relentlessly.

Johnnys grandfather then proceeds to light a cigarette and Johnny asks if he can try.  So his grandfather asks:


“Does your dick touch your asshole?”


“No”


“Then you are not old enough to try”



Later the same scenario happens but it is with a beer instead, when Johnny asks if he can try the same question was asked:


“Does your dick touch your asshole?”


“No”


“Then you are not old enough to try”



A few hours later Johnny comes back in with a couple cookies that his grandmother made for him, his grandfather asks if he can have one and Johnny replies with:


“Does your dick touch your asshole?”


The grandfather smiles and proudly answers:


“Yes, in fact it does”

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.
