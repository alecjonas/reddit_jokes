""No,"" says Mr Trump, ""that would be an accident."" A little girl raises her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy."" ""I'm afraid not,"" explains the exalted businessman. ""That's what we would call a great loss."" The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room.

post,417lex,2qh72,jokes,false,1452933920,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/417lex/i_hate_clowns/,self.jokes,,"I went to the circus.  There were the usual acts, the lion tamers, the trapeze artists, the elephants, the sword swallowers, and finally my least favorite the clowns. This one clown must have seen how uncomfortable I was with clowns because he called me out. He must have done this routine a million times, he started by asking ""you sir, are you a horse's head?"" ""no"" I replied. ""Are you a horse's mouth?"" ""No"" I said again. ""Well then, you must be a horse's ass"" the clown said.  I was destroyed, I had no reply, everyone laughed at me, it was the most humiliating moment of my life.
I decided then and there I would get revenge on the clown in the worst way. I studied literature finding comebacks from modern writing, the texts of the great literary masters of the old days.  I went to clown college and learned their ways in an attempt to get in this clown's head.  
Finally I spotted my chance: the circus was back in town.  I bought my tickets, I watched the sword swallowers, I watched the trapeze artists, the elephants, the lion tamers, and then the clowns appeared.  I saw that same clown with his big stupid grin, his floppy shoes, and that damn red nose.  He started in on that same old routine and I thought to myself ""I have him now"". ""You sir, are you a horse's head?"" the clown asked ""no sir, I am not"" I replied to that smug bastard.  ""Are you a horse's mouth?"" the clown continued, ""no, of course not"" I said in anticipation of the moment I had been waiting for. ""Then you must be a horse's ass"" the clown said, as the crowd burst into laughter. I tried to muster up a response but the crowd was far too loud and the moment had been lost.  
I decided I must learn to command the attention of the crowd. I take debate courses.  I study the speech patterns and body language of the greatest speakers in history.  I master the art of the argument.  I even join a drama club to further improve my stage presence. 

Finally I see the day come when the circus comes to town.  Again I purchase a ticket, again I watch the sword swallowers, the elephants, the lion tamers, the trapeze artists, and last but not least the clowns. My nemesis appears after a line of 20 of his cohorts from a vehicle that is impossibly small.  We lock eyes and he shouts ""you sir! Are you a horse's head?"" confidently and steadily I reply ""no I am not"". He continues ""are you a horse's mouth?"" ""no"" I say again. ""Well then,"" the clown starts with the same old line ""you must be a horse's ass!""  ""Hey"" I shout in retort knowing my moment has finally arrived ""fuck you clown"". ",I hate clowns,0

Suddenly his foot kicked something hard in the sand and he was immediately surrounded by smoke.  A Booming voice said :

""I AM THE GENIE OF THE LAMP""

The man was dumbfounded.

**Man:** WHAT?!  A Genie? Seriously? Like 3 wishes and everything?

**Genie :** Yeah, you get three wishes but there are a couple of things you should know that got left out of all of the stories.

**Man :** Like what?

**Genie :** Well, you have to make all of your wishes before sunset and if you don't then what ever you wished for before sunset will cease to be.

**Man:** That's it?

**Genie:** No.. the union made us add a new one once divorces started up.  What ever you wish for, your ex-wife gets double.

**Man:** That's odd.

**Genie:** Yup, so Master.. what is your first wish? Wait, let me guess, money?

**Man:** Uhh.. Yeah.. Um how about like a billion dollars?

**Genie:** Ok but you understand that means that your ex-wife will get 2 billion dollars, right?

**Man:** That's fine, maybe she'll get audited or something.  She left me and I don't care if she ends up with money.. I mean If I have a Billion dollars, what do I care what she has? 

**(The genie blinks his eyes, nods his head and says ""IT IS DONE"")**

**Man:** It is done?!  I don't feel any different?  There isn't a pile of cash in front of me.. what do you mean IT IS DONE?

**Genie:** Master. The money is in your bank account.

**Man:** Yeah?

**Genie:** Do you have a smart phone?

**Man:** Yeah.

**Genie:** Then go ahead and check your bank balance.

**(The Man grabs his phone from his pocket and opens his banking app to check his balance)**

**Man:** HOLY SHIT!

**Genie:** Yup.

**Man:** I'm a billionaire!

**Genie:** I know.

**Man:** You made me a billionaire!

**Genie:** Nothing gets past you master.

**Man:** Ok.. Ok.. Ok.. So I need to do 2 more, right?

**Genie:** Yes master and you have less than an hour left.

**Man:** Ok.. Umm.. ok.. so I'm a billionaire and I have to make 2 more wishes in an hour or I'm not a billionaire anymore.. But I don't want to just waste them.. Ok.

**Genie:** Your wish?

**Man:** I want ... I wish for.. a woman.. but not just any woman.  She has to love me unconditionally. She has to be gorgeous, and I mean like a solid 10.  She has to be my soulmate.. I mean we have to be perfect together as a couple, and she'll never want to leave.. and never cheat on me.. and. be .. ya know.. adventurous.. in bed.  Because I just got out of a marriage and there wasn't any...

**Genie:** I get it, you want the perfect woman for you.. in every way.

**Man:** Yeah.. and my same age.. and into the same things I'm in too..

**Genie:** I got it.. But you understand that your ex-wife will have 2 perfect men come into her life.

**Man:** I don't care, they can fight over her, I'm done with her.  Hell she'll probably just keep them both and not tell them about each other while she goes out and finds a third.

**Genie:** Yes master.   I am going to look into your soul and bring forth your perfect mate.

**(The genie grabs the mans head, looks deep into his eyes, there is a bright flash, and the genie  says ""IT IS DONE"")** 

**Man:** So, where is she?

**(The Genie steps to the side to reveal a woman standing behind him)**

**Woman:** Hey Babe!

**Man:** Hey!

**Woman:** I didn't know you were gonna be here.  Listen I'm gonna go and wash the ocean off of me.  I'll be by your house at 8, okay?

**Man:** Sounds Great!

**Woman:** Okay, love you!

**Man:** Love you too.

**(Woman walks off down the beach)** 

**Man:** Genie..

**Genie:** Yes Master?

**Man:** You fucking rock!

**Genie:** I know.

**Man:** What's her name?

**Genie:** Her name is Sara.  But Master you must make another wish and you have only 10 minutes left or you lose the billion dollars and Sara.

**Man:** What should I wish for?

**Genie:** That is up to you Master.

**Man:** What about like in Aladdin?  Do you want me to wish you free?

**Genie:** NO!  Being a Genie is awesome.  I don't want it to end.  Please do not wish for that.. 9 minutes Master.

**Man:** Ok.. so last wish.. don't want to waste it.. I'm a billionaire, I have the perfect woman who loves me, what else do I need?

**Genie:** Master this isn't about needs it is about wants.  What do you want that you do not care if your wife gets double??

**Man:** I think I know..

**Genie:** 2 minutes Master

**(The Man closes his eyes)**

**Man:** GENIE! I WISH FOR YOU TO BEAT ME HALF TO DEATH  ",The Magic Lamp,16

One day, there is a local ice sculpture competition in his town. He, of course having enjoyed the hobby so much, decided to enter.

At the contest there was only one judge, but she was a world renowned art critic taking a small break from her real work but still wanting to review something. She went to each contestants sculpture and told them one after another how terrible they all were, and how sad she was that there was no artistic talent in the whole town. Then she walks up to Tim's sculpture, and looks at it in amazement.

""Wow,"" she says, ""this sculpture is absolutely beautiful! I've never seen anything like it. I must ask, what do you do for a living?""
""Oh, well I have a fairly boring day job. It's official title is beeholder, and all I really do is hold the parts of the bee hive with the honey so the other beekeepers can take it off.""

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""
Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""
A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."" ",SENIOR SEX,669

You there sir have some very big balls! After all the shit i have done to help you and the store you turned upside down with your shitty management skills you want to tell me if i don’t like it i should leave? Like everybody else right? You expect for me to slave away to your idiotic demands and when you can no longer manipulate me i leave under your command? Never!! I want you to take a look around you at store *** and look who's still there since you became a manager at Office depot... Lisa, David and me! Where is everybody else John? You ran them off.. They didn’t want to advance in life they didn’t just find other jobs, They left because everybody hates your fucking guts in case you haven’t noticed yet! managers, employees, customers, everybody hates you! you are rude, you are a compulsive LIAR and you just always got to have the last word and you got to have an answer for everything don’t you? I have heard you lie to customers, coworkers and even yourself just to feed into your own arrogance! You are ridiculous! You have control issues dude and i am quiet sure you don’t know that because you continue to tell yourself that you are doing the right things. You like to have people around that you can manipulate and lie to and guess what? I will not be one of those people! I have sat in that store and listened to your bullshit excuses and bullshit lies long enough and to be honest i hate hearing you talk because just a bunch of bullshit comes out of your mouth and you know it. You allowed William to come to store *** and completely fuck the Tech bench up! When i tried to tell you about it i was the judge and juror right? But have you done 1 thing in that store to solve any issues? No! All you do is eat, fart and point fingers and tell everybody else what to do! You have some nerve dude... I have bussed my ass for your liking and now when i refuse to continue to let you lead me in the wrong direction i should quit? No i will not quit and you will not make me! 
You make terrible decisions! Stupid idiotic decisions and everybody in the store just wants to run and sit in corners and talk about it because they are in fear of saying something and losing their jobs. Well i guess i will be the one to speak for everyone then. The store is horrible, everybody is unhappy, you have forced all the good workers out the store with your shitty attitude and smart ass mouth! And God knows how many customers have not came back to the store because of your rudeness and bullshit. talking to you is like talking to a big turd that won’t flush! You are not a manager, hell i don’t know what the hell you are to be honest, being around people is not for you and i think that explains why you have dogs! The time you came to work with that black eye.... The excuse you gave us.. Bullshit, you got ya ass whooped for talking shit didn’t you? Figured! To be honest i don’t care if you don’t say another word to me at that store. You can be mad, pissed or whatever else you want to be! You want to tell people that i am there because i need to be? Are you crazy? You have no idea why i work at that store do you? lol. Only if you were as smart as you want people to think you are sir... You are full of shit John and again i will not ever not say what i have to say.. YOU MAKE BAD DECISIONS! And none of the decisions you make hurts you it hurts everybody else that works there while you go climb up in your little red truck and drive away. When shit goes wrong you are never there, when computers come in when have you attempted to fix 1? For Christ Sakes you cant even make a dam copy in CPD without calling for help and you are the God Dam store manager! What is your purpose? The only thing you can do is force customers into buying instant ink and PPP's that they don’t need. Open your god dam eyes and look around and see what’s going on man. You have a bunch of fucking leaches in the store.. You have people in the store that are strictly just there to make money and go home! I was one of the few that was actually there to work and make my work area better. When i told you that what some people do were affecting the way i work and how i work what did you do? Told me i was bitching and gave me the stupid ass excuses that you usually do and nothing has changed in the past year, nothing! 
As much as i had your back when shit happened, when people talked shit about you, when customers swore they were going to call corporate, when employees said they were going to kick your ass who stepped in and stopped them? Defused the situation? Me! And you want to come and act like i am just some part time punk? You have no idea what i am capable of John! I don’t disrespect you and you will not! I, will not allow you to disrespect me under no circumstance! I'm going to say this again, take a look around man.. See what is really going on in your store that you so called manage! There is a lot more going on that you want to see! I have not become the person i am now for no reason. I am tired of the foolishness, I am sickened by your management. We are understaffed because of you! People don’t come there because of you! You have no respect for customers that aren’t spending $1000 in your store! I have witnessed you called valued customers liars to their face, i have witnessed you do some things that weren’t professional, that management isn’t suppose to do! I hear things, i see things, i know things that you wont think for me to know in a whole lifetime. 
The tech department... Why is it in the condition it is in now? Because of your neglect and all the other managers neglect! Only time you guys come over there is when you want to see how many PCTU we do and i have been saying that for a year now. None of you care anything about the tech bench, all you care about it is the sales. We hardly have god dam computers to sell to customers but the first thing you want to know is if we sell a PPP or got a service! Are you out of your dam mind? You see the chain reaction of shit that has been happening with the tech bench? You know why that is happening? Because of me not giving a shit anymore! Remember how many services we use to get? How many happy customers we use to get? That stopped because of me! I came to you with problems and you gave me shit all the time. I am the best worker you have in that store no matter what you may think. You have only seen 1/4 of my work ethic! And i do mean 1/4 .. 1 day you told me i was ""the best you got"" and now i should quit? You want to be in control so bad and all those silly little people that quit because you wanted them to are just illiterate sheep! But i am not John! I am not, never been. You were an OK guy at one point then you took a turn for the worse. That’s all i am going to say for now John, just know i am no one you have ever met before, you will not treat me like sheep, i will come to office depot and do what i have to do as my job description requires, if you feel like i cant do that then you fire me and we go from there but stop lying! We both know you are a liar and i said that to you today and you told me ""that’s what you get paid for”. Lead by example, If you get paid for lying then so do we and i will not lie for your well being or mine so i suggest you come up with something else. Fix your shit so everyone else can do their jobs! That’s all i ask, make people do their jobs, you have an excuse for why everybody doesn’t do what they are suppose to do. I work 2 days a week and i can get more things done than some people that work 40 hours and i only work 10 and when i ask you, you give me some stupid ass excuse! William and Shawn fucked up the tech Bench and i will not fix it until i get the respect i deserve without the lies and your bullshit! See ya Monday

He eventually decides to go and see a Doctor.
 
The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.
The bad news is that it will require castration.
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' 

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for.  

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.' 

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. 

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly. 

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' 

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' 

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' 

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years.' 

Joe tried  the shirt and it fitted perfectly. 

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?' 

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..' 

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36. 

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..' 

The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your Testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a Headache.'",Headache &amp; testicles,2

After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, ""If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!""

The word got around and nobody called him that any more. Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, ""Good morning, Onestone."" He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do. Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years. Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him and said, ""Good to see you, Onestone.""

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

Disgusted, she decided to make her point another way. While preparing a turkey to bake, she had an idea. She saved the guts from the turkey and set them outside for a couple days to ripen. The she got up early one morning, and warmed the ripe guts to body temperature. She took them to the bedroom where John was still sleeping and dumped them right beside his ass.

One day, a massive flock of millions of pigeons enter the state and start wreaking havoc. They're shitting everywhere and the people are afraid to leave their homes. The Governor is concerned and considers calling a state of emergency. 

One day, while the Governor is hiding away in his office, a man appears and tells the Governor, ""I can fix your pigeon problem, free of charge. My only stipulation is that once I'm done, you aren't allowed to ask me any questions about my method. If by chance you really want to know how I do what I do, you can pay me 100 million dollars and ask me any question you like."" At this point the Governor doesn't care what happens, he just wants the pigeons gone so he tells the man ""Please take care of it, no questions asked."" 

The man walks outside and holds out his arm and a blue pigeon flies down and lands on his shoulder. The man whispers something to the blue pigeon and it takes off. Then, all of the pigeons that have been plaguing the state take off and follow the blue pigeon until they're all out of sight. The Governor is amazed and happy and ready for everyone to be able to go back their lives. 

After a few weeks, the Governor is going crazy. He wants to ask the man a question. He raises the 100 million dollars and has the man brought before him. ""I need to ask you a question sir."" The man says “Ask away, just remember my price."" The Governor says “I know the price and I don't care anymore. I have your money I need to ask you a question. Do you have any blue Muslims?""

At a winery, the regular taster died and the director started looking for a new one to hire. A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came in to apply for the position. The director of the winery wondered how to send him away. He gave him a glass to drink.
The drunk tried it and said, “It's a Muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers. Low grade, but acceptable.”
""That's correct"", said the boss.
Another glass...
“This is a Cabernet, eight years old, a south-western slope, oak barrels, matured at 8 degrees. Requires three more years for finest results.”
""Correct.""
A third glass...
""It's a Pinot Blanc Champagne, high grade and exclusive,'' the drunk said calmly.
The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary, secretly suggesting something.

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just
to be sure."" He sat down and wrote :

A Rabbi and a Priest are driving one day and, by a freak accident, have a head-on collision with tremendous force. Both cars are totally demolished, but amazingly, neither of the clerics has a scratch on him. 

After they crawl out of their cars, the rabbi sees the priest's collar and says, ""So you're a priest. I'm a rabbi. 

Just look at our cars. 

There is nothing left, yet we are here, unhurt. 

This must be a sign from God!"" 

Pointing to the sky, he continues, ""God must have meant that we should meet and share our lives in peace and friendship for the rest of our days on earth."" 

The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. 

This must surely be a sign from God!"" 

The rabbi is looking at his car and exclaims, ""And look at this! 

Here's another miracle! 

My car is completely demolished, but this bottle of Mogen David wine did not break. 

Surely, God wants us to drink this wine and to celebrate our good fortune."" 

The priest nods in agreement. 

The rabbi hands the bottle to the priest, who drinks half the bottle and hands the bottle back to the rabbi. 

The rabbi takes the bottle and immediately puts the cap on, then hands it back to the priest. 

The priest, baffled, asks, ""Aren't you having any, Rabbi?"" 

The rabbi replies, ""Nah... I think I'll wait for the police.”

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. The the agents heard screaming, crashing, and banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.

Lemmy told Bowie and Rickman, who accepted their fate. But the three of them also decided that they didn’t want to leave the world in such grave danger because of the threat posed to world peace by one particularly powerful fourth individual. 

 

So they made a deal. Lemmy would cheat Death! At the moment of dying at the age of 69 years, 11 months and 30 days Lemmy’s soul, in purgatory, challenged Death to a JD drinking contest. Lemmy won (of course) and for his he was granted a few more days on Earth. This took him to the age of 70 so that when he died he was not part of the 69 club.

""Mohammad,"" he replied.


""You're in Ireland now,"" replied the teacher,  ""So from now on you will be known as Mike.""

Mohammad returned home after school. ""How was your day, Mohammad?"", his mother asked

 ""My name is not Mohammad. I'm in Ireland and now my name is Mike.

""Are you ashamed of your name?  Are you trying to dishonor your parents, your heritage, your religion?  Shame on you!""

And his mother beat the shit out of him.  Then she called his father, who beat the shit out of him again.

The next day Mohammad returned to school.  The teacher saw all of his fresh bruises.

""What happened to you, Mike?"", she asked.


""Well shortly after becoming an Irishman, I was attacked by two fucking Muslims.""

It was the first day of class and my professor was giving a brief overview of physiological studies and theories. He then went into a very long description of a supposed psychologist who studied the training of dolphins and it went something like this:




A psychology student, finishing his doctorate, went to study the psychology of animals and spent some time at sea world studying Dolphins. He tried his best to train the Dolphins using positive reinforcement through treats of sardines and fresh fish. However, he was unable to find consistent results. Determined to find a pattern he stayed overnight for a week and observed the Dolphins, attempting to train them each morning. 

On the fourth night he saw a flock of seagulls land in the dolphin habitat with their babies. The Dolphins proceeded to leap out of the water, scaring the adult seagulls away. Unfortunately the baby seagulls were unable to fly away and the Dolphins then swam up and had sex with them. The next morning he conducted the same tests he had earlier in the week and found that the Dolphins were much more receptive to taking orders. 

The student, determined to find a correlation in the happiness of Dolphins and susceptibility to training, snuck off to a beach front the next night. He found a flock of sleeping seagulls and promptly stole all of the baby seagulls he could find. He carried as many of them as he could in his arms back to the dolphin tank at Sea world. 

On his way back he encounter a sleeping lion. He slowly stepped over the lion, in an effort to not wake it. Immediately after he thought he was in the clear a bright flashlight was shone into his eyes. 

A police officer had stopped him. The student asked, ""what am I under arrest for?""
The office responded ""Youre under arrest for transporting underage gulls across sedate lions for unorthodox porpoises.""

I immediately face palmed but secretly loved the joke. ",A joke told to me by my psychology professor...,47

Upon examination, the veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there was no male gorilla available. 
Thinking about their problem, the zookeeper thought of Ed-Lee Walton, a redneck part-time worker responsible for cleaning the animal cages. Ed-Lee had little sense, but possessed ample ability to satisfy a female of any species. The Zoo Keeper thought they might have a solution. Ed-Lee was approached with a proposition. Would he be
willing to mate with the gorilla for $500? Ed-Lee showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under five conditions:
""First"", Ed-Lee said, ""I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips."" 
The zookeeper quickly agreed.
""Second"", he said, ""She must wear a 'Dale Earnhardt Forever' T-Shirt.""
The keeper again readily agreed to this condition.
""Third"", he said, ""You can't never tell no one about this.""
The keeper again readily agreed.
""Fourth"", Ed-Lee said, ""I want all the children raised Southern Baptist.""
Once again it was agreed.

Man! I wish I live there! Blue-Polka-Dot City that's where all the rich cookies live! I'm trying to get a job as an accountant but I haven't had much luck.
To be honest with you i feel depressed working as an accountant anyways. What i really want...
The dream that I've had ever since i had a pacifier in my mouth was to be  Hero!
Like Super-Duper Man, or like Lightning Zeus Boy!
Now those are the real cash cows!
I am not happy in my current life, i want to become someone who the whole world will remember!
I want to be a Hero!

Another job interview. This time I will have to drive 2 and a half hours to get to the place. That's presuming that I will even get the job. That briefcase that carries my credentials as been my best friend as well as my worst nightmare for the past 3 years.
Jumping from ob to job I barely have enough money to get by. Canned food and junk food is basically what keeps me alive. Vegetables? HA! I don't have enough money to buy that!

Anyways I'm walking down Speed-o-Underwear Avenue with my black briefcase handy. Huh I wonder why there's nobody on the streets. Maybe a holiday? No, then my job interview would've been postponed. Then why?

What the--

A giant monster just appeared out of nowhere! It's huge! Massive! It has razor sharp teeth the size of knives, claws that could pierce steel. It bears a rather big belly; like the one an old man watching TV has. Is that thing even human? Oh my god!

""I am part of an extraterrestrial species planning on taking over earth! I have been sen here to see how powerful the human species is!"" It's eyes rotate 360 degrees as it stares at me. ""And for the fate of my species I will measure the strength of the human race by pulverizing you!""

""Hold on! I'm just a 29 year old unemploye--

The weird monster punches me right in the abdomen. I go flying back into a stone wall. I cough up blood. God this hurts!

I can hardly get up. It hurts so much.

""The human race is really weak. Like punching a toothpick. I thought the savage human race would be more powerful."" Th monster grabs me by the neck. ""Truly pitiful.""

He slams me into the wall once more. If only Super-Duper Man was here! He could save me! He could save the city! He could SAVE THE WORLD!!!

But oh well what can a 29 year old unemployed man do?

I think to myself as this monster beats me over and over and over and over and oevr and over and over and over and over.... and over and over and over.

""You're so weak! I will have fun beating your species into a pulp!""

Why? My whole life I've been losing. EVERYTHING! Why do I have to be the one who takes all the pain. I wan to win! I will win!! I will never lose!!! I CAN'T LOSE!!!!!!

I jump up into the air and punch this mysterious creature. I punch it right in its grandpa belly. All of its organs go flying out of its back.

St Peter informs him that he has one last wish he can request before stepping through the Gates. The Evangelical thinks about it for a minute, looks at St Peter and says, ""You know, there is one thing. I'd love to see what hell is like for the sinners. I have spent my entire life warning them about their ways, so I'd like to see them in their just reward. I would really get a kick out of that!""

St. Peter motions him towards an elevator and tells him to push the H button.
The Evangelical steps into it, presses the button, and feels his stomach rise
as the elevator begins a rapid dissent. 

Finally, after 5 long minutes the trip ends and the Evangelical steps through the doors. The first thing that hits his senses is the live band music emanating from a stage. Then the sights and sounds of thousands of souls, eating, laughing, dancing, singing, and having a good time wash over him.Everywhere, as far as the eye can see, are tables piled high with food, scantily clad ladies frolicking around the tables giggling, with laughing men clutching at them. 

After a few minutes, the visibly upset Evangelical retreats into the elevator
and ascends back up to the PG level. (Pearly Gates, if you didn't get it.)

As the doors open he angrily steps out to see St Peter beckoning him towards a
door past the gates labeled ""Dining Room."" He enters it famished to find a dull white room without any furnishings. Only a bare bulb lights it. A moment later Jesus enters the room with a folding card table and three folding chairs which he sets up. A few minutes later St Peter enters carrying three paper plates with peanut butter &amp; banana sammiches.

They all sit down in silence to eat. With each passing minute the Evangelical
is becoming more visibly agitated. Finally St Peter asks him what is wrong. The
Evangelical says, ""Look, down there in hell they are having the party of the century with wine, women, and song. Up here we are eating this crap in a dull lifeless room. What the hell is going on?""

St Peter looks at him in amazement, ""You don't really think we are going to go to all that trouble just for the three of us, do you????""

Timothy is a partner in one of New York 's leading law firms. They live in a 4000 sq ft on Fifth Avenue , where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They have a second home in Phoenix .

Sue relates that she graduated from Harvard Med School and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a leading Wall Street investment banker. They live in Southampton on Long Island and have a second home in Naples , Florida .

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Jim. They run a tropical bird park in Colorado and grow their own vegetables. Jim can stand five parrots, side by side, on his penis.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a cashier at Wal-Mart. They live in a small apartment in Brooklyn and have a travel trailer parked at a nearby storage facility.

Sue, chastened and encouraged by her old friend's honesty, explains that she and Clive are both nurses' aides in a retirement home. They live in Jersey City and take vacation camping trips to Alabama .

Mary admits that the fifth parrot has to stand on one leg.",Old High School Girlfriends Reunion,10

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. 
Do you think I could stay the night?

the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. 

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,

We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. 

Some years later, 

The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. 

The monks again accept him, feed him, even fix his car.

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles When you find these numbers,

you will become a monk.

The man sets about his task.

Some 45 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,

I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk.

We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says,

The sound is right behind that door.

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key?

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire,

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,

silver,

topaz, 

and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know end.

He unlocks the door,

turns the knob, 

and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound
