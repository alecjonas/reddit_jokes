As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

After a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, 
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later 
with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

""No, no, that's no good, I don't like sea travel. What else?""

The assistant ponders for a moment and suggests, ""How about the elusive snowy fanged wolf?""

Feynman lights up. ""The snowy fanged wolf! I love it, how dangerous and majestic! Tell me, where would I find this fanged wolf?""

""Why, that would be Wolf Tundra, Mr. Feynman.""

""The golden heron! How exquisite! I must study it. Tell me, where might I find the golden heron?""

""That would be in Heron Bay, sir"".

Feynman is overjoyed. ""That is a fantastic suggestion! Quickly, book me for Heron Bay at once!""

The assistant packs Mr. Feynman's bags and arranges a train ticket. In the morning, Mr. Feynman heads out in a hurry, forgetting to tell his wife.

Sure enough, his wife calls the lab that evening and the assistant picks up.

Later that night, their mother couldn’t sleep, so she went to the kitchen for a cup of tea. On her way, she tiptoed by her oldest daughter’s bedroom and heard her shyly screaming. The mother thought to herself, “That’s normal, especially on her wedding night.” She snuck by her second oldest daughter’s room and heard her laughing. “That’s normal too,” she said, smiling to herself. Finally, she slipped by her youngest daughter’s room where she didn’t hear a peep, but she thought nothing of it.

The next morning in the kitchen, after the husbands had gone out, the woman asked her eldest daughter about last night’s noises. “Well Mom,” she replied, “you always said if something hurt me, I should scream.” “You’re right, sweetheart, ”the mother assured her, turning to her middle daughter. “Now why were you laughing?” she asked. “You always said if something tickled me, I could laugh,” she answered. “True enough, honey.” The mother smiled, remembering her newlywed days.

“Now what about you, baby,” she said turning to her youngest daughter. “Why was it so quiet in your room last night?” “Mom, don’t you remember? You always told me never to talk with my mouth full.”",[Long] Mind your manners,19

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact $1,000,000,000

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over $100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

""Guys, I think I fucked up.""  ",Three guys and a genie,12

One night Hersch gets up to use the bathroom and forgets to put the seat down when he's done. An hour later Sophie gets up to do the same thing, and falls right in. Worse yet she gets completely stuck.

""Herschel! Herschel!"" she cried. ""Help me! I'm stuck!""

So, Hersch gets out of bed, walks into the bathroom, and sure enough, she's stuck fast. He tries pulling at her to no avail.

""Oy, oy, what are we going to do?"" moans Sophie.

""Relax,"" says Hersch. ""We'll call a plumber.""

""And pay the overnight rate?"" asks Soph, incredulous.

""You want me I should bring you a pillow and you sleep there tonight?"" asks Hersch.

""OK, OK, call him.""

So Hersch calls the plumber, and about 20 minutes later there's a knock on the door.

""There he is,"" says Hersch. ""I'll let him in.""

""Wait! You can't let him in...I'm naked from the waist down!""

Thinking quickly, Hersch takes off his yarlmukeh and hands it to her. ""Here,"" he says. ""You put this over your private parts and you're not naked.""

So she does this, and Hersch lets the plumber in. They walk in the bathroom and the plumber starts surveying the situation. He tugs a little bit on her left arm, tugs on her right arm, then takes a step back and starts scratching his chin and thinking.

""Well?"" asks Hersch, after a moment.

""Well,"" says the plumber, ""I can save your wife. But the rabbi's a goner.""",A joke about my Jewish Uncle Herschel,7

He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it."" The old farmer replied. ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here."" The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in Georgia and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Tennessee. We settle small disagreements like this with the Tennessee Three-Kick Rule."" The lawyer asked, ""What is the Tennessee Three-Kick Rule?"" The Farmer replied. ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up.""

The big-city attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick to the shin had the lawyer hopping around on one foot when suddenly the farmer planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. The barrister was flat on his belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to pass out. The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, ""Okay, you old coot now it's my turn.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Naw, I give up. You can have the duck.""

Secondd guy comes up 
"" hey i robbed a bank and i am sorry"" 
So the student looked up for ""stealing "" on the list , made him return the money and gave him his penitence.


Third woman comes up , she was a prostitute.

""Hey go find fr.steve quickly and ask him what do i give this woman for blowjobs""

She was a very modest mermaid, and always wore seaweed to cover herself. She had a very happy life, until one day, a storm started brewing. She sensed it, and was rushing closer to the mainland when suddenly the hurricane picked her up into the air and carried her along for a long ways!

Gemila flew through the air, and got so sick that she discovered airsickness for merfolk that day. Eventually, she stopped whirling through the air and fell down to land. She was lucky enough to end up in a river that barely ran and was covered with algae. Unfortunately for her, she had lost her clothes in the flight, so she made some new ones out of the plants that she could find.

Edward was a student who was rushing home after the hurricane had dissipated over the county so he could help clean up. He came to his favorite spot to cross the bridge, and saw that there was a beautiful woman lying there wearing almost nothing. Gemila's tail was underwater, and she was alseep, so Edward thought she was a normal woman.

Edward, being the boy that he was, decided that he wanted a look at what she had. So, he crept up to her and suddenly stole her top! This woke up Gemila, and she tried to stop Edward from stealing her clothes. But all she could get was Edward's backpack.

She took off swimming down the river, and Edward shouted ""Hey, lady! Bring back my algebra!"" Gemila shouted back, ""As soon as you give me my *algae bra*!""",Mermaid + Hurricane,0

The rabbit asks for his usual, but they are out of ham. After some deliberation, he gives in and goes for a cheese and onion toastie.

They chat as usual and all seems normal.

The next day though, the rabbit doesn't appear and the barman is really quite upset.

Days turn into weeks and it appears that the rabbit has found a new lunch spot.

Then, one evening, just as the barman is finishing his shift, in comes the rabbit.

When next year's triathlon came, they were ready. They blazed past the competition with ease, and the Bros. took first and second place overall.

:-:|:-:                                 
I was born with a cleft lip. It's a big one, too, right up to my nose. I could have had more corrective surgery on top of the closure they did when I was a baby, but that option always felt somehow like a betrayal of who I really am. In fact, I think my cleft lip is an expression of who I am rather than the other way around. I am shy and it was never due to having a facial deformity. I have the kind of parents that value human decency above all else and as a result I privilege kindness, politeness and generosity to the detriment of personal expression. This was total reinforcement to my shyness as I could couch my true self in my manners and primarily stay in my own head. I believe this to be a good and a bad thing. Seen through one lens it keeps me moving forward through life with little regard of my own wants and needs. This helps me get along with coworkers and roommates, waiters and sales people. The path of least resistance. Through another lens, one that is especially hard for me to look through, I sometimes feel subjugated by my manners, trapped in a cage of politeness and etiquette. I feel lonely, too. Sometimes the glibness of being polite pulls me into a dark place. I see the world interacting around me, vibrant, energetic and flowing. I part my lips to participate and it rings hollow, empty, like a dream where you understand the language everyone is speaking around you but no one can understand you. All around me people have the key to life and I am left peering through the keyhole longingly, aching for the easygoing connection that everyone else is so casual about. I wish badly to break out of the oppressive internalization that has led me to this point in life. That's why today, my birthday of all days, I accepted the invitation from my roommate and ended up here at a dance hall. I am doing something so rare in my life, and I'm so close to letting go, but here I am posted up in the corner, watching a boy. And I'm paralyzed by anticipation. How do I ask him to dance with me? I watch him dutifully. I try not to feel overwhelmed. I can't help but giggle, but right on queue I remember my face. I almost forgot. I wonder what he'll think of me, and I feel myself turn inside. He's tall and so handsome and has a determined look in his eyes. There's something about him that's different, but I can't tell what it is. I can feel myself hiding behind my drink again, but at the same time I feel so ready for this. I am going to show him that I am more than my scar. I'm more than my manners. I'm not glib or empty or hollow. Oh God, he's coming right towards me. Did he see me watching? I feel myself flush. Please let him know that I'm more than this moment. I'm more than my shyness. Look at me. See me. See past my face. I'm a thunderstorm. I'm a volcano. What is he saying? I can't hear over my heart beating out of my chest. Yes, he's asking if I'd like to dance! Here goes nothing. | I lost my eye when I was four or five--I don't think I really remember but my family tells me about it all the time so I've fabricated a story that I lean on pretty heavily when people ask me about it. It was Christmas morning and my brother and I were super excited to open a box that was addressed to both of us from Santa. We had been begging and pleading for a Sega Genesis because we were the only kids on the block without a console. Our family has a single gift opening policy which was killing us as we had to open each present in turn, smile, thank whoever gave it to us for the camera and wait patiently again for our next turn. I should mention at this point that we had one of those super cheesy tinsel trees because it reminded my mom of her childhood Christmases--I guess it was her way of reclaiming her childhood sorrows and turning them into something better. Group gifts were always last and I just couldn't stand it anymore. Doing my best to be sneaky, I knelt by the tree and pretended to count the remaining presents while I snaked my finger into one of the ends of the wrapping paper and pulled it up. No one seemed to noticed, so I peeled it back a little bit more to try and see the box, but just then I felt a hard shove into my back and simultaneously an incredible shock, like my head was splitting apart. My brother had discovered I was sneaking a peak and shoved me from behind right into the tinsel tree. My eye was perfectly ruined by one of the twisted wire branches on the tree, but I had passed out from the shock and would not come to know this until about a week later, unallowed to rub my throbbing eye socket at the hospital. Fast forward twenty-five years and here I am, ever single and ever determined not to have a normal social life. I have never even had the confidence to kiss a girl on my own terms. Although some people with eye implants can move them, I lost all of the muscle associated with my right eye, so my prosthetic just floats there. To make it worse I keep a wooden eye in there most of the time. I think I do it to keep people at arm's length, to use it as a foil that circumvents possible rejection. But no longer. Tonight I'm going out and making this happen. I deserve to be happy. I deserve a woman who can look past my googly eye and see me for more than the damage I've lived with my whole life. That's why we're at this club. That's why I'm talking to this beautiful girl. She seems so shy. It's dark here but she's talking to me from behind her cup and I know I like her. There's something about her, like I know her. Like we have the same story and the narrator just hadn't brought us together yet. ""Would you like to dance with me?! Or go outside and talk?!"" I shout. But the fucking bitch. As she lowers her cup to shout at me over the music I see she has something wrong with her face. This Joaquin mother fucker. She's shouting, ""Wood eye! Wood eye!"" right at me. Right in my fucking face. See how you like it:

post,6zpolq,2qh72,jokes,false,1505248287,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6zpolq/old_piano_player/,self.jokes,," A gray-headed old man shuffled into a downtown bar holding his head up high.  His hands shook as he took the ""Piano Player Wanted"" sign from the window and handed it to the bartender. ""I'd like to apply for the job,"" he said. “I was a Navy F-4 pilot off the USS Coral Sea. I learned to play the piano at Officers' Club happy hours while in port, so here I am."" 
 
The barkeep wasn't too sure about this doubtful looking old guy, but it had been quite a while since he had a piano player and business was falling off.  So, why not give him a try. 
  
The old pilot shuffled his way over to the piano while several patrons snickered. By the time he was into his third bar of music, every voice was silenced. What followed was a rhapsody of soaring music unlike anything heard in the bar before. When he finished there wasn't a dry eye in the place. 
  
The bartender took the old Navy pilot a beer and asked him the name of the song he had just played.  It's called ""Drop your Skivvies, Baby, I'm Going Balls To The Wall For You"" he said.  After a long pull from the beer, leaving it empty, he said ""I wrote it myself."" 
  
The bartender and the crowd winced at the title, but the piano player just went on into a knee-slapping, hand-clapping bit of ragtime that had the place jumping.  After he finished, the F-4 pilot acknowledged the applause, downed a second offered mug, and told the crowd the song was called, ""Big Boobs Make My Afterburner Light."" 
  
He then launched into another mesmerizing song and everyone in the room was enthralled. He announced that it was the latest rendition of his song, ""Spread 'em Baby, It's Foggy Out Tonight and I Need To See The Centerline"", excused himself and headed for the john. 
  
When he came out the bartender went over to him and said, ""Hey, Fly boy, the job is yours; but do you know your fly is open and your pecker is hanging out?"" 
  
""Know it?"" the old fighter pilot replied, ""Hell, I wrote it!”

Peter.

at another woman! I  treated my wife like a queen!""

The priest told the sinner, 'You are forgiven. Go and say three Hail Mary's'.

Soon thereafter, another Irish man entered the confessional.
'Father, it has been two months since my last confession. I've had sex with Fanny Green twice a week for the past two months.'
This time, the priest questioned, 'Who is this Fanny Green?'
'A new woman in the neighbourhood,' the sinner replied.
'Very well,' sighed the priest. Go and say ten Hail Mary's.

At mass the next morning, as the priest prepared to deliver the sermon, a tall voluptuous, drop-dead gorgeous red-headed woman entered the sanctuary. The eyes of every man in the church fell upon her as she walked up the aisle and sat down right in front of the priest. Her dress was green and very short, and she wore matching, shiny emerald-green shoes.
The priest and the altar boy gasped as the woman in the green dress and matching green shoes sat with her legs spread slightly, just enough to realize she wasn't wearing any underwear.

The priest turned to the altar boy and whispered, 'Is that Fanny Green?' The altar boy couldn't believe his ears but managed to calmly reply:

""No Father, I think it's just the reflection from her shoes""

Then the boy said again: but before you get undressed we need to have 10 eyewitnesses to make it legit.

Bored of the one-sided conversation, the monk soon proposed a challenge of wits.


The farmhand was uninterested in testing his wits against the monk, no matter how much his roommate raised the stakes. Finally the monk offered the farmhand substantial odds: ""I will give you 50 gold coins for every question of yours I cannot answer, if you will give me 5 gold coins for every question YOU cannot answer.""
At this, the farmhand agreed.


""Very well!"" exclaimed the monk. he eagerly tried to think of a question sufficient to challenge the farmhand, but simple enough to keep the game interesting. ""How would one measure the volume of an irregularly shaped object?"" he asked, his eyes gleaming.


Without even bothering to think about it, the farmhand handed the monk 5 gold coins.
The monk was disappointed, but prepared himself for the farmhand's challenge.
For his turn, the farmhand pinched his face deep in thought. Finally, he asked: ""What has the heart of a tiger, the wisdom of an eagle, and the strength of an ox?""


Delighted by the riddle, the monk leapt to his feet and began pacing around the room. For six hours he was mercifully silent as he pondered the farmhand's conundrum. Soon, he grew irritable. Eventually his face sunk with fury and disdain. ""Alas, alas! I give up!"" he cried, waving his arms. Reluctantly he withdrew a sack of coins and counted out fifty precious gold pieces for the farmhand. The Tiller happily accepted his winnings. The monk stared at his roommate. ""Well!"" he said at last. ""What is the answer to your riddle?""

The doctor asks for a description of the snake, and upon hearing it was white with orange marks, the doctor gasps and tell the man help will come as soon as possible, but it's very important that he with a sharp knife cuts a wound in the skin over the bitemarks, and sucks out blood and spit it out on the ground, because the snake is extremely venomous and he needs to suck out as much of the venom as possible before it spreads in the veins.

He calls her, and stutters a bit on the phone, but she finds his stammering cute and accepts his proposal. ""Pick me up at seven,"" she says. ""Oh joyous day!"" says Jerry. His joy is short-lived, however, because he realizes that he has only delayed the inevitable. How can he conceal his boner? He tries a number of solutions, including willpower, distractions, baggy pants-- nothing works. Finally, he decides to just tie it to his leg.

Feeling confident, he heads off to her house. He's all dressed up, he brought her flowers, his car is cleaned, everything is in order. He walks up to the door and rings the bell. She opens the door. He kicks her in the face.

""Right away, Father."" said the eldest son, departing at once, determined to become king.

Then to his middle son, Nimble and Self-righteous, ""You are to retrieve your great grandfather's shield, bearing our coat of arms, from the deadly jungles of India, lost at the site of a battle since forgotten."" ""I shall do so at once, Father."" said the middle son, and so he too departed at once.

Then he beckoned for his youngest son, a young man Intelligent, but meek next to his older siblings, to approach. ""Yes, Father?"" The son inquired. To which the King replies, ""Bring me a coke, I never liked those assholes.""
",There was a king ready to abdicate.,1701

The father never helped his wife with the daily chores and he never had time for his son. So his wife decided to get a divorce. But who would get their son? All the other familymembers, like the aunts and uncles, said: ""Carl belongs to Betty. Peter never had time for him anyway."" Everybody thought the same, except uncle John. The rest of the family was about to explode with anger when he said this, but to prove his point, he came with this great comparison: ""Look at this Betty, I've got a coin here. There's a machine there that sells soda cans. Now, if I put this coin in the machine, and a can of soda comes rolling out of it, who's the owner of the can, me or the machine?""",a funny joke I heard once,0
