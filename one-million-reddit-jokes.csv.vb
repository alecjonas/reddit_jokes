**The joke:**

Quasimodo is walking through the enchanted forest on his way to the castle to take part in an ""Ugly Contest"". On his way he bumps into Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs. 

*""Grumpy, how you doing? where you goin?""*

*""I'm good mate, on my way to the castle for the Annual Midget Contest, you?""*

*""No way, me too, but for the Annual Ugly Contest, good to have some company lets go""*

So they are making their way through the forest and bump into Sleeping Beauty. Turns out she is going to the castle as well for the Annual Beauty Contest.

So hand in hand they pick up the pace and wish each other luck as they enter the castle and go to their relevant halls.

First out of the castle came Sleeping Beauty, with tears of joy *"" I can't believe! It's true! I am the most beautiful girl in the world""*

Second came Grumpy, *""I cant FOOKIN believe my luck! I'm the shortest human in the world!""*

Finally, Quasimodo storms out of the castle running past both Sleeping Beauty and Grumpy screaming and shouting swear words that one can only imagine were created in the dark mind of the ugliest human in the world. Just before he dissapeared around the corner, he stopped and turned around to the other two companions and with tears in his eyes screamed...

After the event, he stops in to the little restaurant next to the venue called ""The Matador"".  As he checks out the menu trying to decide what he wants, he sees a waiter bring a dish to another customer.

The other customer starts eating what appear to be two large meatballs with great gusto. When the waiter comes to his table, the man asks about the dish. ""Oh Senor, that is the Matador Special,"" replies the waiter in broken English, ""Our very best dish!  Fresh vegetables, beans and zee cojones from zee bull. We get the cojones immediately after the bull fight.  Exquisito!""

""Okay, that's what I'll have,"" says the businessman.

""But I am very sorry Senor, but that dish is only available once per day.""

Disappointed, the man chooses another dish and plans to order the Matador Special the next day.

The next day the man goes to the bull fight again, and afterwards stops into the restaurant. Just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees another waiter bringing the Matador Special to a customer who got there before him.  ""Damn!"" he says to himself.  ""And tomorrow's my last day here.""

So the next day, he skips the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early.  He is the first one seated, and proudly proclaims, ""I'll have the Matador Special!""

""An excellent choice, Senor!"" responds the waiter.  Soon afterwards, the waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly small, and taste rather foul.

He's like 100 feet tall and stomping around like Godzilla, just absolutely crushing shit and laughing about it. The Pope hears about this and decides he has to go and try to stop Satan. Obviously, he takes the dog along.

So the Pope gets to Satan and is all, ""Hey-a you Satan! You-a betta stop a-stompin' around! In-a the name-a Jesus! You go-a right back-a to Hell!""

Satan just laughs. He lifts up his giant devil-foot and smushes the Pope. The dog tries to jump in the way to protect him, but obviously he gets smushed too, poor pooch.

Anyway, as everyone knows, the rule is that if Satan kills the Pope, then a magic portal to Heaven opens up and Satan is supposed to be able to climb through it and run a-muck in Heaven. So, Satan's all stoked cause now he gets to go do that, but right as he's about to climb through the portal, God shows up and is like, ""Ah-ah-ah nooo I don't think so Satan!""

Then Satan's like, ""WTF God?! Rule says I get to come in there and tear shit up!""

Only weeks after leaving office on January 20, 2017, former President Barack Obama discovers a leak under his sink, so he calls Troy the Plumber to come out and fix it. 
Troy drives to President Obama's new house, which is located in a very exclusive, gated community near Chicago, where all the residents have a net income of way more than $250,000 per year. 
Troy arrives and takes his tools into the house. He is led to the guest bathroom that contains the leaky pipe under the sink. Troy assesses the problem and tells Obama that it's an easy repair, that will take less than 10 minutes. Obama asks Troy how much it will cost. Troy checks his rate chart and says, ""$9,500."" 
""What?! $9,500?!"" Obama asks, stunned, ""But you said it's an easy repair. Michelle will whip me if I pay a plumber that much!"" 
Troy says, ""Yes, but what I do is charge those who make more than $250,000 per year a much higher amount so I can fix the plumbing of poorer people for free. This has always been my philosophy. As a matter of fact, I lobbied the Democrat Congress, who passed this philosophy into law. Now all plumbers must do business this way. It's known as the 'Affordable Plumbing Act of 2014'. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it."" 
In spite of that, Obama tells Troy there's no way he's paying that much for a small plumbing repair, so Troy leaves. Obama spends the next hour flipping through the phone book calling for another plumber, but he finds that all other plumbing businesses in the area have gone out of business. Not wanting to pay Troy's price, Obama does nothing and the leak goes un-repaired for several more days. A week later the leak is so bad President Obama has had to put a bucket under the sink. 
Michelle is not happy as she has Oprah and guests arriving the next morning. The bucket fills up quickly and has to be emptied every hour, and there's a risk the room will flood, so Obama calls Troy and pleads with him to return. 
Troy goes back to Obama's house, looks at the leaky pipe, checks his new rate chart and says, ""Let's see, this will now cost you $21,000."" 
Obama quickly fires back, ""What? A few days ago you told me it would cost $9,500!"" 
Troy explains, ""Well, because of the 'Affordable Plumbing Act,' a lot of wealthier people are learning how to maintain and take care of their own plumbing, so there are fewer payers in the plumbing exchanges. As a result, the price I have to charge wealthy people like you keeps rising. Not only that, but for some reason the demand for plumbing work by those who get it for free has skyrocketed! There's a long waiting list of those who need repairs, but the amount we get doesn't cover our costs, especially paperwork and record-keeping. This unfortunately has put a lot of my fellow plumbers out of business, they're not being replaced, and nobody is going into the plumbing business because they know they can't make any money at it. I'm hurting too, all thanks to greedy rich people like you who won't pay their 'fair share'. On the other hand, why didn't you buy plumbing insurance last December? If you had bought plumbing insurance available under the 'Affordable Plumbing Act,' all this would have been covered by your policy."" 
""You mean I wouldn't have to pay anything to have you fix my plumbing problem?"" asks Obama. 
""Well, not exactly,"" replies Troy. ""You would have had to buy the insurance before the deadline, which has passed now. And, because you're rich, you would have had to pay $34,000 in premiums, which would have given you a 'silver' plan, and then, since this would have been your first repair, you would have to pay up to the $21,000 deductible, and anything over that would have a $7,500 co-pay, and then there's the mandatory maintenance program, which is covered up to 17.5%, so there are some costs involved. Nothing is for free."" 
""WHAT?!"" exclaims Obama. ""Why so much for a puny sink leak?!"" 
With a bland look, Troy replies, ""Well, paperwork, mostly, like I said. And the internal cost of the program itself. You don't think a program of this complexity and scope can run itself, do you? Besides, there are millions of folks with lower incomes than you, even many in the 'middle class', who qualify for subsidies that people like you must support. That's why they call it the 'Affordable Plumbing Act'! Only people who don't make much money can afford it. If you want affordable plumbing, you'll have to give away most of what you have accumulated and cut your and Michelle's income by about 90%. Then you can qualify to GET your 'Fair Share' instead of GIVING it."" 
""But who would pass a crazy act like the 'Affordable Plumbing Act'?!"" exclaims the exasperated Obama. 
After a sigh, Troy replies, ""Congress ... because they didn't read it.""

It seemed that each passing day, night absorbed more of the light, and the days grew progressively colder. Fearful that the Nightman was punishing them, they congregated in the town square to seek the wisdom of the elders.

“Hey guys, didja notice that it seems each passing day, night absorbs more of the light, and the days grow progressively colder?”

“Yeah! We really should do something about that.”

“I’m fearful that the Nightman is punishing us, we should congregate in the town square to seek the wisdom of the elders!”

Soon, all the townspeople joined those other three guys in the square. The crowd was overcome with panic as the Eldest Elder approached the proscenium. (The square had a really awesome stage.)

He exclaimed, “Do not fear The Dying of the Light, my people, for I am Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman, Champion of the Sun. I have found a solution! We will set our clocks back one hour and your fears will be allayed.”

The crowd hushed as confusion set in.

“What the Hell is a clock?” cried Townsperson #3.  “And what the Hell is an hour?” shouted Townsperson #1 (smugly, considering his status as Townsperson #1). 

The Eldest Elder continued, “So where it was once 7 o’clock, it will now be 8 o’clock. Thus giving us an additional hour of daylight- so we can continue to wash our underwear in the same river from which we bath and drink.”

“What the Hell in an o’clock?” muttered a muddled, unnumbered, townsperson. (Numbering of townspeople was completely arbitrary in those days.)

At this point, Elders Arizona and Indiana looked at each other; knowing the Eldest Elder was incorrect, they shook their heads and retreated behind the curtain- never to be seen again. (Legend has it these elders left for a place the Nightman did not follow.)

The rumblings dissipated as the townspeople grappled with understanding the implications of this new system. Although something seemed amiss, they did not question the authority and superior judgment of the Eldest Elder. After all, he was Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman, Champion of the Sun. And he had tenure so there was nothing they could do about it anyhow.

Surprisingly, in the days to come, despite the Eldest Elder’s bold proclamation, it was found that the Dying of the Light increased dramatically. Fearing the wrath of the Nightman, the townspeople did not speak up, for his power was undeniable and they would not encourage his wrath any further. Instead, before night fell over the town, they worked with great urgency to wash their underwear in the same river from which they bathed and drank.

And thus the tradition of Daylight Savings Time was begun.









…Some time later, a young boy sat on the Eldest Elder’s lap and asked, “Where do girls come from?” The elder looked upon the boy, gulped back the dregs of his sixth brew, burped into his beard, and then muttered something about tearing out a man's rib. But that is another story…

The lawyer is exstatic, jumps out of the carriage and runs in joy to his new home.

This priest think ""wow if this is what he gets then i am surely graced""

They pull away and as they travel the priest notices things aren't so nice, the roads barely look paved, the houses are run down and the sky becomes cloudy and dull.

A traffic cop pulls over a man on the highway. He asks for his License.
""I haven't got one, what with my constant drunk driving arrests.""
The cop is somewhat taken back, but proceeds to ask for registration.

""You have a gun in the car?""
""Yes I used it to shoot the owner.""
""You shot somebody?!""
""YUP. Body's in the trunk.""
""THERE'S A DEAD BODY IN THE CAR??!!! HOLD ON I NEED BACKUP.""
A half-hour later, reinforcements have arrived and a senior officer cautiously approaches the car.
""Sir, what is your name?""
""It's right here on my License."" He hands the cop his License.
The cop then asks that he slowly open the glovebox, and to his surprise finds it empty. The driver shows his registration and confirms that it is his car.
The bewildered cop asks him to pop the trunk. Sure enough, no dead body.
""Alright, I'm confused. The stopping officer said that you didn't have a License, stole the car, murdered the owner and stashed his body in the trunk.""
""Oh really. Did that liar also say I was speeding?",A police stops a speeding man.,14

The bartender says ""Buy him a drink and he'll tell you himself.""

So he buys a pint for the strange man and asks about his big orange head.  

The man with the big orange head says ""Well, it's a long story...

I was walking down the beach about a year ago when I saw an old brass lamp that had washed ashore.  I picked it up and just as a kind of joke I decided to rub it.  Well, who would've guessed, a genie popped out in a cloud of smoke.

The genie said, ""Thank you for freeing me, mortal!  I will grant you three wishes, but I caution you!  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it!""

I brushed off the warning and right away I wished to be the richest man on Earth.  The genie waved his hands and suddenly a massive beachfront mansion appears, piles of gold and money sprout from the sand around me, and the genie hands me the keys to a Ferrari.  

So that one went pretty well, for my next wish I wished for the most beautiful wife in the world.  The genie clapped his hands and out of the ocean strides the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, so beautiful I almost regretted wishing for her.  I didn't deserve to look at that woman.  I still don't.

Then the genie said, ""You have one final wish!""

In death's agony, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favorite chocolate chip cookies wafting up the stairs.  He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed.  Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and with even greater effort forced himself down the stairs, gripping the railing with both hands. With labored breath, he leaned against the doorframe, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for death's agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven: there, spread out upon newspapers on the kitchen table was literally hundreds of his favorite chocolate chip cookies.

Was it heaven? Or, was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man? Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture.  His parched lips parted; the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mouth; seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand shakily made its way to a cookie at the edge of the table, when his wife suddenly smacked it with a spatula. 

""Stay out of those,"" she said, ""they're for the funeral.""

""No,"" says Mr Trump, ""that would be an accident.""
A little girl raises her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""
""I'm afraid not,"" explains the exalted businessman. ""That's what we would call a great loss.""
The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room. ""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?""
Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: ""If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.""

He did his best to sniff out where the source of the smell was coming from, and after a long travel he found it.

The lizard looks up into a tree, only to see a monkey smoking. Being a curious lizard, he looks at the monkey and yells ""Hey! What's going on up there?"" The monkey looks down to reply and tells the Lizard "" Come up here and see, You'll love it. ""

So the lizard, curious as can be, goes up and checks it out. The monkey looks at him and says ""Try this marijuana. You'll love it!"". The lizard, not know what marijuana is, starts to smoke with the monkey. After hours of continuous smoking, the lizard says ""I'm going down the path to get a drink of water. I'll be back, save me some!""

So the lizard gets down from the tree, and walks down the path until he finds a dock over a river. He walks as far as he can and leans over far to get a good drink of water, when all of a sudden a turtle swims by and startles him! He falls in the river, and can't swim!

A nearby alligator starts swimming towards him, as he tries his best to get away. The old alligator helps him out, and after the lizard is breathing again, the old alligator says ""What do you think your doing trying to swim in these waters, and what have you been smoking?!""

After the lizard explains to the old alligator, he has to find out exactly what is going on. He walks down river to meet this bad monkey who knows he's doing something wrong.

While walking down the path, he finds the monkey still in the tree smoking marihuana. He looks up and yells with a loud old voice ""Hey! What do you think you're doing?!?!""

The monkey, Very startled, looks down at the alligator and replies:

""DUUUUUUDE! How much water did you drink?!?!?!""",The Lizard &amp; The Monkey,31

The nun said “God is with you son”
The man thanked her and kept on walking. As he is walking he runs into a homeless man begging for chnange. The man gives him a dollar. The homeless man says to him “God is with you”.

He drinks for hours until it starts getting dark. He decides to go home but the bartender stops him.
“You sure you're okay to drive buddy?” asks the bartender.
“I'll be fine...hic” says the man “after all...God is with me!” and he leaves. 
He gets in his truck and starts to drive home. Its really dark now and he can't see very far. The drive home is full of curves and sharp turns. 
He passes the first curve and almost hits a tree but comes out okay. He is way above the speed limit at this point. He comes up on the second curve and he doesn't slow down enough for it and flies off the road tumbling down the hill and dies instantly.
He wakes up at the pearly gates. St. Peter calls him and asks him “Why do you deserve to be in heaven?”
The man is baffled and confused. “I'm not supposed to be here”. The man looks around and sees God and waves him down. “Hey God what gives? I thought you were with me? Where were you?”

This being his first time away from home for so long he was worried that his wife may get lonesome and need some intimate attention while he is gone. The next day he goes to the local sex toy shop and not impressed with the initial selection he asks the gentleman behind the counter for the best dildo money can buy.

The clerk goes to the back and appears with a seemingly ancient dusty wooden box. As he opens the box it reveals an intricately carved dildo. Amazed the husband asks ""What is that?!"". The clerk simply responds that it is named Voodoo Dick. 

The clerk proceeds to tell the man how it works. using some sort of black magic you can command the Voodoo Dick by simply stating ""Voodoo Dick!, and then stating where you would like the Voodoo dick to start pleasuring.  He ends the conversation with the most important piece of advice. He says ""when you are finished with it you must state ""Voodoo Dick stop"" or command it to move to another part of the body. 

The husband throws money at the clerk and runs home. He explains it to his wife in detail and then leaves on his trip.

The first week goes by and the wife decides that she needs a little action and opens the box containing Voodoo dick. struggling to remember the exact commands she finally utters ""Voodoo Dick, My pussy!"". A slight shimmer surrounds the magical dildo and it raises from its box and starts immediately pounding away at her vagina. 

She reaches the most amazing orgasm she has ever experienced. Looking down she states ""ok you can stop now"". Voodoo dick keeps fucking. 

""STOP!"" she screams. Voodoo dick keeps fucking.
""QUIT, its hurting now!"". Voodoo dick keeps fucking.

In a panic she runs to her car and starts driving to the nearest hospital. The whole time she is speeding down the highway, Voodoo dick is pounding away.

A police officer sees her speeding and pulls her over.
Frantically she tells the whole story to the officer in hopes he will let her go.
The officer, taken back by the story, looks at her and says...

Voodoo Dick my ass!

One day, he rides along with a highway patrol officer named Burt.

""Are you finding policing very different in the States?"" Burt asks.

""Not really,"" says Juan.  ""A lot of Mexican laws are based on American ones.  Our laws are better organized, though.""

The officer chuckles and swiftly pulls over his first catch of the day--a young man in a Chevy, going ten miles over the speed limit.  Burt lets him off with a warning.

Juan shakes his head when Burt returns to the car.  ""Back home we wouldn't pull someone over for something as little as that.""

A few minutes later, the cop pulls over another car, a woman in a Fiat, for zig-zagging through traffic and tailgating.  Burt takes several minutes writing up a citation.

""American laws are much stricter than I expected,"" Juan said when the cop came back.  ""In Mexico, we wouldn't even notice someone driving like that.  We certainly wouldn't give a ticket.""

Finally, the pair see a red sports car roar down the shoulder, zipping past one, two, three cars before Burt can flip the siren on and zoom along the shoulder after him.

As both cars come to a stop, Juan's face lights up.  ""Ah, this is more what I'm used to.  I know how to handle this one,"" he says.  He steps out of the car, draws his gun, and shoots the driver dead.

""What'd you do that for?!"" yells Burt.  Juan looks confused.  ""That's one of the laws from America, do you really not know about 'Tres passers will be shot?'""",The Police Academy Exchange Student,1

post,3nqjxg,2qh72,jokes,false,1444155594,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3nqjxg/bellys_bellbutton/,self.jokes,,"There once was a boy named Billy, who at birth, was born with a screw in his bellybutton. Throughout all his early life, Billy had this screw in his bellybutton, and as he was approaching his teens, Billy began to think that in future life, this screw may become awkward. On his 13th birthday, Billy decided to start praying in hope that the screw would somehow be removed.

Over the years, every birthday, Billy prayed that this screw would be removed from his bellybutton. On his 16th birthday he prayed yet again to no avail, after this point, Billy began to pray on a daily basis, he knew it would become a much larger issue in the latter end of his teens, and he was uncomfortable confronting girls because of this screw.

On his 18th birthday, Billy decided that the screw needed to be removed, so he prayed harder than he had ever prayed before... ""Please god! Please remove this screw from my bellybutton"", he said. Suddenly thick clouds began to cover his house, the ground began to shake violently, then a gap appeared in the clouds and an enormous hand emerged from the sky carrying a screwdriver. The screwdriver came closer and closer to Billy, and then it engaged with the screw in Billy's bellybutton. Slowly the hand turned the screw, and bit by bit, the screw started to come out from Billy's bellybutton. Just as the screw popped out, Billy's bottom fell off.

PS: This joke is better when spoken, the emphasis on insignificant parts adds to the joke.

And so forth. This man had a litany of problems. So he hears a noise on the other side of the statue. He gets up and he walks around. There's a little bitty Mexican, down on his knees, praying to the same statue of Jesus. And the Mexican is saying,

""Jesus, please help me. My wife is pregnant. We already have twelve children. I've just lost my job. Now we're going to lose the house. Now I learn that my wife is sick. I don't know what I'm going to do.""

So the wealthy Texas rancher gets up, and he takes out his billfold, and he takes a hundred dollar bill out of his billfold, and he hands it across to the little Mexican. And he says,

""Here you go, little buddy... Don't be bothering Jesus with that shit!""

""Murray"", whispered Estelle, ""how does the bouncer know your name?""

""Oh, that's Bill. He's in my bowling league. I guess this is where he works.""

Estelle nods, a little confused, but ok.

""Murray"", says Estelle, now a little more urgently, ""how does the bartender know you??""

""Oh, that's just Renee.. she bartends at the bowling alley - i guess she moonlights here too.""

""Ok"", says Estelle.. getting a bit more rattled.

They find a seat, and a stripper comes right up to Murray and starts grinding him.
""Hey Muuuuurray... you want your usual dance tonight baby?""

At this, Estelle has had enough, and storms out the front door, with Murray chasing after her.

She hails one of the taxis parked out front, and he jumps in after her. 

Murray can't get a word in edgewise. After giving the driver directions, Estelle lays into him. Cursing at him. Yelling at him. Calling him every name in the book. 

This goes on for about 5 solid minutes, until Estelle, exhausted from the explosion, stops altogether.

There's finally a moment of silence in the cab.

Every night after dinner, Merle took off for the local watering hole. He would spend the whole evening there and always arrive home, quite inebriated, around midnight each night. He usually had trouble getting his key to fit the keyhole and couldn't get the door open. And every time this happened, his wife would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out and always coming home in a drunken state. But Merle just continued his nightly routine. One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened and said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then he might change his ways."" The wife thought that this might be a good idea. That night, Merle took off again after dinner. And at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Merle in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Merle down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to Merle, ""It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?"" At that, in his inebriated state he replied, ""I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!""
