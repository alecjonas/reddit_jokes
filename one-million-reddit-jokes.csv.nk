Not wanting to be a jerk he says, ""You want to go out there and show them how it's really done?"" 

Smiling she agrees and they have a great time. 

After a while both of his friends took off with both of hers. Back at the table, he asks her if she's got a ride home.

She tells him, ""no but I can call someone to pick me up.""

Trying to be nice he tells her ""nonsense I'll give you a ride!""

On the ride they're laughing and getting along well and she tells him, ""I'm really enjoying spending time with you and am not ready for the night to end yet, why don't you pull over at that park and we can talk.""

They pull over and are talking for a while, when she finally kisses him.

""I'm sorry,"" she blushes, ""you're just so nice and I like you.""

""it's perfectly fine."" he smiles.

""Would you like to make love to me?"" she asks. He agrees and they start going at it, but with her  legs it's hard to do in the truck.

She thinks and says, ""My arms are pretty strong, why don't you take me to the Monkey bars, I can hang and we can do it that way.""

So they go at it, finish up and he drives her home.

After he wheels her to the door her dad comes out.

""Come here boy,"" he says, gesturing him over.

Worried, he walks over, ""uhh yes sir?""

""I just wanted to thank you for driving her, that was damn decent of you and I haven't seen her smile like that in years.""

Feeling guilty, he says, ""It's no big deal I was glad to do it.""

One day the biologist found that he was out of seagull mash, a main ingredient in the eternal life food. Worried that the he would miss the next critical feeding of the dolphins, he grabbed his shotgun and ran out to the beach to shoot some seagulls.

On returning to his lab with gulls in hand, the biologist was shocked to see a lion, seemingly sleeping, on the entrance to his lab. As he was in a great hurry to make a new batch of eternal life food, he took a risk and jumped over the lion to get into his lab. Once inside, he saw several policemen waiting for him. They arrested him for transporting gulls across a staid lion for immortal porpoises.

""Oh lord, how beautiful!"" The first belle replies, trying not to sound a little envious. ""It looks like a dream, hon.""

He bought a yearling stallion and a couple mares. He thought his pastoral life was pretty sweet, until the stallion started misbehaving. So, he asked his neighbor down the road what to do.

""You need a mule."" the old farmer said.
""Will that help?"" the salesman asked.
""Absolutely. The only thing more pig-headed than a young stallion is a mule. He'll have that horse playing second fiddle in no time.""
""Well do you have a mule I could buy?""
""Sure do. I'll sell you Murphy, he's a great mule, and i'll only charge you $100.""

The salesman thought that was a great deal, and handed the farmer the $100 straight away. Later that week, he came by to pick up the mule.

""I'm here to pick up Murphy!"" the salesman announced.
""You know, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,"" the farmer said, ""but Murphy died two nights ago.
""Well, can I have my $100 back then?""
""No, I spent it already, I can pay you back, it'll just be a while.""
""Never mind that, I'll just take the dead mule.""
""What do you want with a dead mule?""
""Does it matter? I'm paying you $100 for a dead mule.""

The farmer shrugged, and figured if this guy wants to buy a dead mule, that's on him. So he helped load it up.

Several weeks later, the farmer met the salesman in passing, and just could not help but ask him about the mule.

""How did you ever come out on that dead mule?""
""Great. I made $98 profit on that mule.""

The farmer couldn't believe it.

""How did you get someone to pay $198 for a dead mule?""
""I didn't. I had a raffle, and the winner got the mule. I sold 100 tickets at $2 apiece.""
""But wasn't the winner upset when he found out the mule was dead?""
""Of course he was."" said the salesman. ""So I gave him his $2 back.",The value of a mule.,15

As I was walking along the beach with the Sasquatch.

Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.

For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,

One belonging to me and one to the Sasquatch.


After the last scene of my life flashed before me,

I looked back at the footprints in the sand.

I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,

especially at the very lowest and saddest times,

there was only one set of footprints.

This really troubled me, so I asked the Sasquatch about it.

""Sasquatch, you said once I decided to follow you,

You'd walk with me all the way.

But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,

there was only one set of footprints.


I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, 

You would leave me."" He said: ''GrrwAAAAAAAugh''",Footprints in the sand,3

The woman gets an odd expression on her face and looks down inside the stroller. The two babies are still sleeping peacefully. But suddenly, the woman starts SCREAMING.

The waiter, of course, is startled, but when he tries to ask the woman what's wrong, she just gets up and bolts, taking the stroller with her but leaving her bags and purse at the table.

This whole scene has not gone unnoticed, and the hostess on duty walks over to the table. ""What the hell was that all about?"" she asks.

The waiter is completely baffled. ""I have no idea! I just asked her about her babies and she freaked out!""

The hostess looks in the woman's purse and finds her ID. ""Okay, weird. This woman came in the other day; I remember her name because she called and made a lunch reservation, even though we usually don't do those.""

However, after he accidentally ran over someone when he was on a race with his friend, he was charged with second degree murder. In the process of the crash the electric wire fell and zapped Mighto for 10 whole seconds. 

After he was sent to prison, he could never drink water with his mouth. It would electrocute him because he was charged with so much electricity. Instead he had to steal straws to be able to drink. Eventually the prison guards just use him to charge their phones by putting the wire against his skin. 

But the other people in the prison cells saw this and laughed at him. Until one day in the shower a man taunted him and pushed him. Mighto pushed him back and said ""don't you know who I am?""

""I am Mighto Con Dria, the powerhouse of the cell.""

I'm sure I can find a way for you to help the church, but I don't think there's any way you can be the bell ringer.""

To this, the armless man smiles and says ""Oh don't worry, i have a special technique, I've done this countless times. And while I've never seen a bell that big, I'm sure it will work if you give me a chance to show you.""

Intrigued by this, the priest allows the armless man to see if he can ring the bell. They reach the top of the church, where the bell rests, and the priest goes, 

""Alright, I don't think you can do it, but if you can make that bell ring I'll give you the position on the spot""

When he says this, the armless man gets excited, he says 

""watch this""

and charges headfirst at incredible speed straight at the bell. When his head hits the well polished side, the priest is amazed. The bell swings out and makes a loud 'GONG' sound. The armless man, also excited, turns and says,

""see, I to-""

Just then, the bell comes swinging back, and knocks the armless man off the side of the church. He lands with a sickening *smack* and doesn't move.

The priest, horrified of what accusations might be made, immediately runs down and hides the body in the church before anyone could see what happened. Several days pass uneventfully, but eventually several men come knocking on the priests door. When he greets them they immediately show him a sketch of the armless man. They ask,

""Do you know this man?""

On the tent floor sat an eleven hundred pound woman. Her eyes were sunken and nearly hidden behind an overhanging forehead.

He peeled away the layers of clothing to reveal a massive scab covering her vagina. Determined to save himself and his friends, he ripped the clot of dried blood, dead skin, and sweat away, threw it out the door, got down to business, and fucked her all night long. 

The following morning, exhausted, ashamed, and famished, the elder stepped outside the tent to welcome his friends inside for breakfast. ""Let's go. Food inside,"" he said weakly.

When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.

“You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it,” the bartender tells him, “and it would taste better if you bought one at a time.”

The Irishman replies, “Well, you see, I ‘ave two brothers. One is in America, the other is in Australia, and I’m ‘ere in London. When we all left home, we promised we’d always drink this way to remember the days we drank together. So I drink one for each o’me brothers and one for meself.”

The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and gives him his three pints.

The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: He orders three pints and drinks them all together, one sip each.

One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the other regulars take notice and fall silent.

When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, “I don’t want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.”

The Irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. “Oh, no, everybody’s just fine,” he explains, “It’s just that me wife ‘ad us join that Baptist Church and I ‘ad to quit drinking. ‘asn’t affected me brothers though.”

Before leaving, one of the soldiers tells him not to press the big red button on the wall, otherwise something extremely bad will happen to him.

He spends an hour trying to sleep, but couldn't sleep on the hard and uncomfortable ground. So he tries to talk to that mouse that hasn't moved since he came in the cell. But the mouse dies when he touches it. So he spends a few hours looking through the window. But he got bored of it and stopped looking through it.

Thinking that he was going to die anyway, he presses the big red button on the wall. At first, nothing happened, but after a few minutes, the door opens and a tall, muscled black man enters the cell shouting : "" WHO THE FOOCK PRESSED THE RED BOOTON ?"". The Jew got scared and ran at the other end of the cell. The black man keeps shouting : ""You pressed the red booton, so noow I have to foock you very hard. So tell me, you wanna be foocked with or without loob ?"". The Jew didn't know what to answer, so he says : ""Huhhhh... Without lube ?"". The black man then managed to catch the Jew. He fucks him thoroughly during hours, and the Jew couldn't stop crying. When he was done, the black man left the cell, and the Jew was so tired he started sleeping after a few minutes.

The next day, the Jew wakes up with a big pain in the ass, literally. He couldn't remember what happened yesterday, but he notices that big red button on the wall. He presses it, ignoring what will hapen. Like before, the black man opens the door shouting : ""WHO THE FOOCK PRESSED THE RED BOOTON ?"". The Jew then remembered everything that happened the other day and tries to escape the cell via the window. But it didn't work, the black man catches him before he could move. He then yells : ""You pressed the red booton again, so you knoow what will happen, I have to foock you. This time, you wanna be foocked with or without loob ?"".

A plane leaves the Los Angeles airport under the control of a Jewish captain. His co-pilot is Chinese. It's the first time they've flown together, and an awkward silence between the two seems to indicate a mutual dislike. 

Once they reach cruising altitude, the Jewish captain activates the auto-pilot, leans back in his seat, and mutters, ""I don't like Chinese."" ""No rike Chinese?"" asks the co-pilot, ""why not?"" 

""You people bombed Pearl Harbor, that's why!"" 

""No, no,"" the co-pilot protests, ""Chinese not bomb Pearl Hahbah! That Japanese, not Chinese."" 

""Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese...doesn't matter, you're all alike!"" 

There's a few minutes of silence. 

""No rike Jews!"" the co-pilot suddenly announces. 

""Why not?"" asks the captain. 

""Jews sink Titanic."" 

""Jews didn't sink the Titanic!"" exclaims the captain, ""it was an iceberg!""

He takes the first exit he finds after crossing the border and goes inside the nearest fast food restaurant.  He orders a small French fries and small cola.  The cashier hands him a 64 oz. bladder buster full of cola and an entire tray piled high with French fries.  The Canadian says, ""But I order a small fries and drink!""  The cashier replies, ""Everything is bigger in Texas.""  So the Canadian drives on down the road a little further until he is tired and finds a hotel.  He decides to go visit the hotel bar and asks the bartender for a shot of whiskey.  The bartender pours him a giant beer mug full of whiskey.  The Canadian says, ""But I only ordered a shot of whiskey!""  The bartender replies, ""Everything is bigger in Texas.""  So the Canadian dutifully begins drinking the mug of whiskey and consequently becoming extraordinarily drunk.  Eventually nature calls and the Canadian sloppily asks the bartender, ""Where doooooouh Iaaahh find the bafroom?""   The bartender says, ""Go through that door.  Take a left and two rights and you'll be right there.""  However, the Canadian being impaired, takes a right and two left turns and wanders into the pool area where he accidentally falls into the water.  He bursts to the surface yelling with panic, ""Don't flush!  don't flush!""",Everything is bigger in Texas,452

Frustrated Ray storms off into the bathroom, undresses, and walks back into the room completely naked except for the boots.                     
                                                                           
Again, he asks, a little louder this time, ""Notice anything different now?""                                                                     
                                                                           
Bessie sighs, folds her knitting across her lap and says, ""Ray, what's different? It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday and it'll be hanging down again tomorrow.""                     
                                                                           
Furious, Ray yells, ""DO YOU KNOW WHY IT IS HANGING DOWN, BESSIE? IT'S HANGING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY NEW BOOTS!!!!!""                                       
                                                                           
To which Bessie replies with a cat-like grin, ""Shoulda bought a hat, Ray. Ya shoulda bought a ""hat"".",The Cowboy Boots,35

The dog did as asked and gathered up all of the sheep for his farmer, however, he missed a few! He only came back with 30...

The farmer was infuriated so he sent his dog to dog school.

A week later, the dog returned. The farmer decided to test his dog's improved farming abilities and told his dog ""round up those 35 sheep!""

To which the dog replied, ""sir there are 40 sheep.""

The farmer had realized the error of his ways- the dog was too smart for farmwork!

So the farmer sold his dog to a farm nearby.

On the farm nearby, a farmer was hanging around with his dog when the farmer said ""round up those 35 sheep!""

To which the dog replied, ""sir there are 40 sheep.""

When she checked out the next morning, the clerk handed her a bill for $450.00.

She exploded and demanded to know why the charge was so high. 

The clerk told her that $450.00 is the ""standard rate,"" so she insisted in speaking to the manager. 

The manager appeared and informed the woman, ""This hotel has an Olympic sized swimming pool and a huge conference center that are available for your use.""

""But I didn't use them,"" she said. 

""Well, they are here and you could have,"" explained the manager. 

He went on to explain she could also have seen one of the in-hotel shows for which the hotel is famous. 

""We have the best entertainers from the world over performing here,"" the manager said. 

""But I didn't go to any of those shows,"" she said. 

""Well, we have them and you could have,"" the manager replied. 

No matter what the amenity the manager mentioned, she replied,

""But I didn't use it!"" and he manager countered with his standard response. 

After several minutes of discussion with the manager unmoved, she decided to pay, wrote a check, and gave it to him. 

The manager was surprised when he looked at the check. 

""But madam, this check is for only $50.00.""

""That's correct. I charged you $400.00 for sleeping with me,"" she replied. 

""But I didn't!"" exclaimed the very surprised manager.

""Well, too bad. I was here and you could have.""

Each year they petitioned their respective governments to allow them to go to Yellowstone to study these wondrous beasts.

Finally, their request was granted and they immediately flew to New York and then on west to Yellowstone. They reported to the local ranger station and were told that it was the grizzly mating season and it was much too dangerous to go out and study the animals.

They pleaded that this was their only chance. Finally the ranger relented. The Russian and the Czech were given cell phones and told to report in each and every day.
