Lads and gent, what is the worst reason that leads to your previous break up? I will tell you that none of those are as bad as mine. This happened like 1 month ago, it was a night when I and couple of friends go out for a few drinks and damn the german really can handle their alcohol, aren’t they?

I will never forget the first week I’m in Germany, one of my new German friends tell me to go out and grab a drink with him. Let just assume that all of you guys here know German, I don’t care what people tell me about the German language but I think it's beautiful, it’s the language of poetry and some time war, just some time. So my friend told me to go out and drink just “ein bisschen” (a little bit). It sounds so innocent isn’t it ? “ein bisschen”, there’s nothing scary about that. No one will give a shit if North Korea say they will nuke a world just “ein bisschen”. So I said yes and we went out and drink just “ein bisschen”. I end up drinking 6 beers and 2 cocktails and 4 shots. And u know I got fucked up, I pass out and didn’t remember a thing. And after that day I always told myself to drink carefully.

So where are we? ah my break up, I went out for a drink cuz it was my friend’s birthday and its also his last day in Germany, you know that I’m gonna get wasted again and I did. The only thing I remember is one of my friends carry me to my door and left me there. What a dick, at least just give me a tip, if u want you can put the whole thing in.

So I went inside, get naked cuz it the best play to sleep. I can do that because my gf told me that she’s gonna stay with her best friend that night.

The next day when I woke up and got my worst hangover of my life, I feel something really weird. I turned around and saw a girl sleeping next to me, only in her bra and underwear and it not my gf...

Turn out my gf didn’t go out, she invited her best friend to our house.

And yeah you know what going to happen. Yes, i slept with my gf’s best friend. And my gf caught me when I was trying to put my pant back on.

I told you it’s going to be bad, but I can make it worse. It wasn’t my gf’s best friend. It was her sister.

Oh, I can make it worse. She only 12.

But I can make it even worse with only 2 words: True story.

The police caught the wrong Asian cuz we all look the same, aren’t we?

Suddenly, the man realized his seat was right next to the Pope himself!

Shortly after take-off, the Pope took a crossword puzzle out of his carry on bag and began penciling in the answers.
""This is fantastic!"" the gentleman mused. ""I'm really good at crosswords!""
It crossed his mind that if the Pope got stuck, he’d ask him for assistance.

The three Cardinals behind, in front of and beside him shrunk down in their seats, as far as possible, all looking for something on the floor.
The gentleman was in morbid shock.
He couldn’t breathe.
He went within himself, thought deeper, longer for a plausible answer and after almost a minute, the dark clouds of evil parted in his mind and the sun shone in.
Turning to the Pope, the gentleman said with reverence and politeness, ""I believe, Your Holiness, that you're looking for the word, 'aunt.'""

The plumber comes over and quickly fixes the sink. The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, ""How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck."" But he pays it anyways.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?"" John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""","A math professor, John, is having problems with his sink .....",342

The Priest smiles, puts a brotherly hand on Bob's shoulder and says...... ""You better hurry home now. My wife died a year ago"".",The priest's wife,86

Success? It got better than his? He smiles politely and nods a bashful goodbye, entering the next room. There lies a beautiful woman. The kind any man wishes he could get. She waves her long blond hair and pouts her lips, advancing with a painstaking elegance. Her dress leaves little to the imagination, and, like the woman before her, she says, ""You can have me, right here, right now, or you can carry on to success...""

By now he's just curious. Could it really get better than this? Into the next room he goes, and this time, the woman is prettier than anything he's ever come across in his lifetime. She's completely naked, and a king size bed awaits them. ""You can have me, right here, right now,"" she says throatily, ""or you can carry on to success.""

He can't help himself. He *has* to see what's next. He enters the next room, and the door slams shut behind him. It's dark and seedy, and in front of him stands a morbidly obese man, wearing nothing but socks. He tries to turn back, but the door is locked.

Upon arriving at the agreed-upon location, a patch of woods in Mississippi, the owner of the raccoon hound informs the man that this is in fact the best coonhound he has ever seen or owned. However the owner explains, that his “methods “are a bit different than other coonhounds. The man is curious and thinks to himself, “How bad could this be?”  So he agrees to go with the owner on a short hunt to see what the dog can do.

They walk for a while into the woods and soon enough the dog catchers a scent, howls and takes off running into the woods. When they catch up with the dog the dog has two raccoons treed. The owner shoots the two raccoons, they fall to the ground and no sooner than they hit the ground the dog is on top of them and furiously having sex with their corpses. The man is dismayed at what he is seeing.  The owner shakes his head and says, “I told you his methods were unorthodox but he really is the best tracker I’ve ever owned.

The man, while little shaken, decides to continue with the hunt.  They walk for only a few minutes before the dog catchers another scent, howls and runs off into the woods again. When they catch up with the dog this time the dog has three raccoons pinned in the tree.  The owner once again shoots the raccoons, and again without hesitation when the raccoon corpses hit the ground the dog goes to work and begins violating the raccoon corpses. The man at this point is greatly disturbed. “He does this every time?!” The owner of the dog again shakes his head and says, “I know but think about it, we’ve only been out here for an hour and we already have five raccoons.

The man decides to give the dog one more run. They pick up their raccoons and once again the dog catchers a scent  very quickly. When the owner and the man catch up to the dog, the dog has four raccoons in the tree. The owner quickly takes aim and shoot all four raccoons, three of the raccoons fall to the ground and the dog immediately starts humping away.  The forth raccoon got stuck on a tree branch during its fall. The owner hands his gun to the man and starts to climb the tree to retrieve the raccoon. About halfway through his climb, the owner slips and begins to fall from the tree. As the owner is falling he screams down to the man, “SHOOT THE DOG!!

Indignant and offended, Satan walks over to the infernal thermostat and turns it up to its highest amount.

My friend asked me today if I had ever heard of El Muro, the greatest Bandido in all of Mexico. 'Well, do I have a story for you.' I said.

'One day I was riding on my horse alone through the desert when all of a sudden El Muro, the greatest Bandido in all of Mexico came riding towards me on his horse. All of a sudden, he jumps off of his horse and points a gun at me.

""Get off the horse and give me your money."" He says.

Well he had the gun, and I had no gun, so I got off the horse.

""I am sorry Mister, but I have no money.""

Thinking for a moment, he says, ""Then take off your pants.""

Well he had the gun, and I had no gun, so I took off my pants.

""Shiiiit."" He says.

Well he had the gun, and I had no gun, so I shit.

""Eat it."" He says.

Well he had the gun, and I had no gun, so I ate it.

Oh, El Muro, the greatest Bandido in all of Mexico, he laughed and he laughed so hard that he dropped the gun.

Picking up the gun, I pointed it at him. Shocked, he puts up his hands. After thinking for a moment, I smile.

""Take off your pants."" I say.

Well I had the gun, and he had no gun, so he took off his pants.

""Shiiiit."" I say.

Well I had the gun, and he had no gun, so he shit.

Since he was a chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.
Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. 

But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?"" 
""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. 

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. 

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?"" 
""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's going to be a very cold winter."" 
The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. 

Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure th at the winter is going to be very cold?"" 
""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen."" 
""How can you be so sure?"" the chief asked. 
The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy.""

post,7je9o4,2qh72,jokes,false,1513115371,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7je9o4/my_first_time/,self.jokes,,"I recall my first time with a condom. I was 14. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at Parchen's pharmacy. In those days it took a lot of guts to go in a store and ask for that kind of item because everyone in town knew me and there was no doubt the young lady (I think her name was Nola) knew what they were for.  
She was working as an assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was really embarrassed by the whole procedure. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one.  
I honestly answered, 'No, not really.'
So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure.  
I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was. 'Just a minute,' she said, and walked me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'Do these excite you?' She asked.  
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. 'Well, come on', she said, 'We don't have much time.'  
So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful that, unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was done within a few moments.  
She looked at me with a bit of a frown. 'Did you put that condom on?' she asked. I said, 'sure did,' and held up my thumb to show her.  
Then she beat the shit out of me....  

Women have always been hard for me to figure out.

""Why, what happened?"" James queries.
""Well,"" Harry says, ""I just went bankrupt and I've still got to feed my family. I don't know what I'm going to do.""
""Could‘ve been worse,"" James replies calmly. ""Could’ve been worse.""

""Could‘ve been worse,"" says James, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.

""Oh!"" says Harry. ""Things just get worse and worse. It's one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!""
Harry nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: ""Could've been worse.""
 

This time, Harry grabs James by the shoulders. ""Wait a minute!"" he says. ""I'm not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past few months we've run into one another, and every time I've told you the latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: 'Could‘ve been worse.'

She was born in late December, and the doctors ran all the normal tests but didn't detect anything. At her first year check-up, the doctors noticed a small, benign tumor in her chest cavity, so they had a quick surgery to remove it just in case it was potentially harmful. But they detected the same tumor at her next birthday check up, and so they ran some tests to find out that not only was she growing a small heart next to her original one, but she also had a mutation that gave her a special bloodtype, usually denoted by the acronym SPCL (the doctors usually pronounced this ""Special"") The second heart was always smaller than typical, but got bigger as she aged just like the rest of her body.

Every year she had a check up around her birthday where they removed the extra heart (since it was so small that it'd be useless), but when she turned 23 the heart was large enough to potentially be used as a transplant for a small child. There was a small girl that had been on a transplant waiting list for several months now, and desperately needed a heart transplant to survive. Her name was Cheng Yu, and she was going to die within a matter of days if she didn't get the transplant. The girl thought this was the perfect opportunity, and so, during her birthday check up, the doctors hastily removed the heart and gave it to Cheng. But, all did not go as planned. The doctors had to rush, and could not check to see if the Special blood type was compatible. Cheng's body rejected the organ and she died immediately after. The girl felt devastated and responsible for her death. The next year, her doctors told her that another wait-list patient had a compatible blood type. The girl saw this as her opportunity for redemption, and immediately went in for the surgery as usual for her birthday check-up. I managed to interview her right before she went into the surgery room, and she told me: 

""Last Christmas, I gave Yu my heart, but the very next day, she gave it away. This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone Special.""",The Girl Who Could Grow Multiple Hearts,30

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

I passed the police check point where they were pulling over drivers and performing breathaliser tests. Because I was in a bus they just waved it past.

I arrived home safely, no accidents,which was a real surprise because..

One day during practice, one of his trombone players kept playing out of tune. After the third time yelling at him, James decided to come down and beat him over the head with the trombone, and James ended up killing him. The trial was pretty open and shut since there were 200 witnesses to the murder, and James was sentenced to death by the electric chair. When the day finally came for his execution, a prison guard came by James's cell and asked for his last meal request. 

""How many amps are they gonna give me?"" James asked. 

""The lethal amount"" the guard responded. 

""Then I'll have 10 bananas"". 

The guard was confused by the request, but gave him the bananas. James finished them incredibly fast, and was taken away to die soon after. They brought James in, strapped him down, and turned it on. But nothing happened. Confused by this, the guards brought James back to his cell and decided to try again the next day. 

When the next day rolled around, the guard came back and asked James for his final meal request. 

""How many amps are they gonna give me?"" James asked. 

""Twice the lethal amount"" the guard responded. 

""Then I'll have 20 bananas"". 

The guard didn't understand why James wanted so many bananas, but he had to give them to him. James was miraculously able to finish all the bananas, and then was taken away to die. They sat him down, strapped him in, and turned it on. But again, nothing happened. By this time there was a public outcry about how inhumane it is to try to kill someone multiple times and fail. A judge agreed with them, and told the prison they had one more chance to kill him and if they couldn't, James would be a free man. And so while the electric chair was being prepared one final time, the guard came to ask James for his final meal request. 

""How many amps are they gonna give me?"" James asked. 

""Three times lethal amount"" the guard responded. 

""Then I'll have 30 bananas"". 

The guard was suspicious, but was told he had to fulfill the request and so James scarfed down 30 bananas in an incredible display before he was taken to the electric chair for a third time. They sat him down, strapped him in, and turned it on. But once again, nothing happened. The prison was forced to let James go as a free man, but before he left the prison guard who had delivered his meals stopped him and asked,

""How did you survive? Was it the bananas?""

James turned to face him as a smile crept over his face and said, 

""No, I'm just a poor conductor""

The father looked around and said ""Who me?""


""Yeah, you,"" said the parrot ""you're ugly, you and your whole family are ugly. Your little girl's ugly, your little boy is ugly, and your wife is really, really ugly.""


The father is startled. Then he gets angry. I can't believe this lousy bird. He walks into the shop and finds the owner. ""Listen,"" he begins, ""my family and I are walking down the sidewalk in front of your shop and your parrot starts using foul language and putting my family down. I don't really appreciate that.""


The pet owner apologizes profusely, and says ""don't worry I'll take care of Mr. Parrot, but good."" He goes outside, grabs the parrot by the neck and jerks him out of the cage. He then proceeds to slap him against the wall, stomps him on the sidewalk, and chokes him half to death, before putting him back in the cage saying, ""Don't you ever talk that way to anybody again.""


The owner leaves him lying on the floor of the cage and walks back inside. But as the family starts to walk away, the parrot raises up and yells ""Hey you!""


The father stops and looks back. ""Yeah what?""


The parrot says, ""You know!""","This family was walking down the street one day, and they came to a pet shop...",0

Everyone loved Juan. He was so sweet and compassionate with the kids and did a wonderful job. One day the principal came up to Juan and said:

""You know Juan, you care about this school so much, maybe you should run for the board of education""

And Juan said:

""You know, I've never thought about that before, but why not?""

So Juan got up in front of the people in town and gave a speech:

""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog""

Now politicians tend to be dishonest, but the people of this town knew Juan, and his statements hit home with them. Juan was elected by a landslide.

Juan worked tirelessly to clean up the schools, day and night, instituting new programs and fixing the curriculum. In a very short time graduation rates doubled and test scores shot up.

Then one day the governer died of a heart attack, and the people who Juan worked with closely on the board suggested Juan run.

Juan said:

""Well I've never thought about that before, but why not?""

Juan gave a speech to his state:

""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids and I love my dog""

The state went wild for such an honest and loveable man and he was elected.

As governer he made his home state a wonderful place to live, businesses boomed, communities were peaceful, crime was down and employment was up. Everyone loved Juan.

Then one day Juan was approached by a political group that endorses candidates for major offices. They asked Juan if he would like to run for president.

Juan said:

""Hmm, I've never thought about tbat before, but why not?""

Juan stood before the American people and said:

""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog.""

The crowd goes ballistic, the American people lose their god damn minds. No candidate had ever been so universally loved like Juan.

Juan is elected President of the United States.

A few years go by. Juan keeps every one of his campaign promises. Unemployment is down to basically nothing, the economy is booming, the national debt is on its way to being paid off.

Then reality hits Juan.

He has no where to go from here.

Juan becomes depressed. He starts drinking heavily.

One day he is sitting in the Oval office drunk as a skunk when his wife comes in. She wants funding for a new project. Juan doesn't listen. He pulls out a gun and shoots her. Then Juan's children come into the oval office wanting the time and attention of their father. He shoots them a well. Lastly his dog comes trotting in looking for a walk or a treat but he shoots the dog as well.

This doesn't sit well with the American people. He is arrested and put up for impeachment but is able to make bail and get out for a while before the trial, but he's not allowed back in the white house and he doesn't have a home.

Juan wandered the streets with a heavy heart when it started to rain. Juan finds a dumpster, lifts the lid and starts to climb in. A homeless man jumps up from inside the dumpster and pushes Juan away.

“Hey there!” Said the dog.

“Woah! You actually do talk!” The man replied.

And the two got into a full on conversation that lasted well over an hour. Eventually the man got to hear the dogs whole life story, and the dog had told him about his past. Like how he was a former member of the CIA, had been in the military, had traveled the world, gone to outer-space, and even met the president! 

The man was absolutely amazed by the dogs ability to speak English, and decided that he wanted to buy him. So he went up to the front door of the house and knocked on the door. 

A man came to the door.

“Can I help you sir?” He said.

“I’m here to buy the talking dog you have for sale, but I can’t believe you’re only selling him for $100! He just told me about how he’s traveled the world, and fought in the military, and met the president and...”

There was a town that sat atop the mountains of Northern France. In this town, there was one single church. One night, the priest of the church saw a man wandering with little purpose, so he asked the man if he needed assistance. Before the priest could even finish, the man interrupted, “Could you spare me one half of a peeled blueberry?” The priest, confused, obeys the man’s request. Before he could even ask what the blueberry was for, the man vanished.

The priest went to bed that night and couldn’t stop having dreams about this mysterious man and his mysterious blueberry request. The dreams were starting to drive the priest insane, but finally the morning came and it was easier to forget all about the situation. At the end of the next day, the priest saw the same man. “Father, could you spare me half of a peeled blueberry?”  The priest, getting creeped out, followed these requests and gave the man another blueberry, but this time he firmly grasped the man’s arm so he couldn’t run away. The man broke free and sprinted away before the priest could even ask what the blueberry was for.

The priest decided he would work on his grip strength to hold the man tighter. All week he was squeezing things to work up his strength. When the next Sunday night rolled around, the mysterious man was there once again. “Can you spare me one half of a peeled blueberry?” The priest was ready. He want to get the blueberry and he grabbed the man as he gave it to him. Unfortunately, the priest’s hands were still too sore, so the man escaped easily. The priest started to get pissed, and figured he would give his hand a rest so they wouldn’t be so sore the next week. As the next Sunday night came, the mysterious man, once again, showed up. “Father, can you spare me one half of a peeled blueberry?” The priest was absolutely ready. He got the blueberry, gave it to the man, and grabbed his arm. It was the week that the priest could finally ask the man why he requested such a mysterious object. The man was too strong for the priest, and was still able to escape.

The priest was absolutely fed up, and he devised a plan to trap the man to find out what the half blueberry was for each week. The curiosity was killing him. First, the priest worked on his running so he could catch up to the man. Then, he saved all of the banana peels he had. He also installed ropes to trip the man, and plenty of fences the direction the man would run. The next Sunday night, when it was getting darker out, the man showed up. “Father, can you please spare me one half of a peeled blueberry?” The priest gave him the blueberry and the man started to run. The priest caught up and threw banana peels in front of the man. The man tripped, but kept going. Then, the man ran into the priest’s rope trap and tumbled down. The priest kneeled down next to the man and said, “Son, please tell me, why do you request one half of a blueberry without the skin?” The man was reluctant, but knew he had lost and had to answer. ""Alright,” responded the man, “You must promise not to tell anybody what I am about to tell you. “I promise,” said the priest. The priest kept his promise and never told anybody.",The one request,10

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.
