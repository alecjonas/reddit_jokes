He goes out into the woods looking for something to shoot at when he comes to a clearing and sees on the other side a bear!  Imagining a helluva hunting story, he takes aim, shoots until he's out of bullets, and then runs across the clearing to claim his prize. He looks around behind the bushes and doesn't see anything. Then he feels a tap on his shoulder. 

He spins around and there's the bear! The bear says, ""Look, buddy, I don't really appreciate being shot at. But I can see that you're new at this whole hunting thing so I'm going to give you a choice. You can let me maul you... Or you can let me fuck you in the ass.""  The guy thinks it over and decides he can always come back and kill the bear tomorrow, so he agrees to option 2. The bear does his thing and the guy goes home. 

The next morning, the guy wakes up, sore as hell and pissed off. He limps to the pawn shop and buys himself a hunting rifle. He heads back out into the woods and soon finds himself at the same clearing. Sure enough, there's the bear on the other side. Again, he shoots every bullet he has and then runs over to make sure he got the bear this time. But once again, he feels a tap on his shoulder and behind him is the bear, looking pretty pissed off himself. ""Ok asshole, same deal,"" says the bear. Figuring he'll get the bear tomorrow for sure, the guy agrees to be ass-raped again. So the bear does his thing, and the guy goes home. 

The next day, the guy is fucking determined. He hobbles back to the pawn shop and buys a whole case of grenades. He heads back to the woods and just starts tossing them everywhere. After the smoke clears, he goes back to where the clearing used to be, hoping to find some charred fur or bear chunks to prove he's killed the bear this time.  But he feels a tap on his shoulder *again* and the bear says, ""son, you aren't in this for the hunting, are you?""",[Long but worth it] A city boy decides he wants to go hunting one day...,21

The bartender thinks this guy is full of shit so he goes and gets the cheap 12 year stuff and pours a glass. The guy takes it, sniffs it, and takes a drink. He then proclaims, ""well that's a 12 year old glass of scotch"".

The bartender think it's just a lucky guess so he goes and gets a 20 year old bottle and pours the guy a drink. The guy takes it, sniffs it, and takes a drink. He then says, ""oh well that's a 20 year old glass of scotch"".

So now the bartender is kinda impressed so he goes into the back cabinet and gets a nice 45 year old bottle that he keeps for special occasions. He pours the guy a drink and then hands it to him. The man takes it, sniffs it, and drinks it. He proclaims, ""well that's a 45 year old bottle of scotch!"". 

The bartender is now amazed and a small crowd is beginning to form. The bartender goes in the back room and takes out the 75 year old bottle of scotch. He pours the glass in the backroom so there's no chance this man can see the label. He hands the guy the drink and once again: he takes it, sniffs it, and drinks it. The man then correctly proclaims, ""that's a 75 year old bottle of scotch!"". 

Now the bar is in a slight uproar and the man has a big grin on his face. A man from the crowd goes, ""Hear try this one!"".

...Well, it started with the Gulf War. I was a young kid fresh out of high school, but I was poor. I needed money for college, and the Army looked like a good way out of the ghetto. But then they shipped me over to Kuwait. My platoon took some heavy fire during Desert Storm, and I was separated from them.

I wandered the desert for days, with only the contents of my pack to sustain me. Sand. Sand was all I could think about. Everything else ceased to exist out there. I can only progress slowly, because I have to hide in my tent every time when even the smallest sandstorm comes around. I kept thinking, may be there are not just oases, nomads, and pompous cities in this desert. Supposedly there are ancient ruins as well. But until now now I only found lonely pillars scattered around the desert. Still my hopes were not disappointed, for now. I found a group of nomads, who were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. I decided to spend some time with them, before I set out again. Things went well, but I had nightmares on most nights. All the wandering in the desert must have exhausted me so much. I dreamt of large desert scorpion made of sand, some times it would be a large eagle chasing me into a big labyrinth.

During one such sleepless night, I saw a mysterious man. Exhausted and wounded, was seeking refuge in our camp. Just before dying, he told me about a river whose waters bestow immortality on whoever drinks from it. The river is next to a place called the City of the Immortals. Determined to find it, I thanked my nomad friends and set out to find this City. 

The days were uneventful, but the nights began to terrify me. I know that the majority of deserts are rife with life. But it is frightening to hear the sand move in the silence of night. And sometimes I found footprints in the morning near my tent, and they were definitively human. Maybe someone is just following, maybe one of the kids of one of my nomadic friends. But they grew in number the closer I got to the city, and they are always fresh. And I also suddenly heard quiet whispering one night, only heard when I almost fell asleep. I woke up from the nightmare to find myself tied up in a small recess on the side of a mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. I don't know how I got there, but I managed to free myself and I could see the City of the Immortals in the distance. I assumed I can walk towards it, but one Troglodyte was already following me. I had to run as fast as I could to get away from him. At last I reached the City of the Immortals.

The City of the Immortals is an immense labyrinth with dead-end passages, inverted stairways, and many chaotic architectural structures. I was Horrified and repulsed by the city, but decided to get inside, because the Troglodyte was chasing me. I eventually escaped the city only to find the Troglodyte waiting on the other side. I was exhausted. I didn't want to run anymore. I surrendered myself to him. To his will. But it turned out that he really was a Genie, and that the Troglodytes are the Immortals, having destroyed the original City of the Immortals and replaced it with the labyrinthine.

'I am the Genie of the labyrinth' said the entity. 'For finding your way out of the labyrinth, I shall grant you three wishes. What is your first wish?'

I was incredulous, of course. I deduced I must be hallucinating after all this running and exhaustion, and that this was desert madness. I decided to test the mirage. 'Alright,' I tasked it, 'I wish for a wallet with a million dollars in it, that I can never lose, and whenever I take any money out of it the sum is immediately replenished.'

'Your wish is granted!' said the Genie. I felt a bulge in one of my uniform pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a new wallet, stuffed to bursting with crisp, new bills. I counted them -- sure enough, it was a million dollars. I ripped up the bills, cast them to the winds, and threw the wallet as hard as I could. The moment it was beyond my sight, it teleported instantaneously back to my pocket, refilled with another million dollars.

'What is you second wish?'

I pondered the notion for a long moment, assessing my needs. 'Genie,' I said, 'for my second wish, I want to be transported to a cool, abandoned palace, into a harem room with a hundred beautiful young virgins who will all fall madly in love with me at first sight, before a buffet table set with a feast fit for a Persian king.'

'Your wish is granted!' Poof! I found myself in a royal harem, escaped from the heat of the desert. All around me, nubile girls eyed me with keen interest. In front of me, every conceivable type of meat was roasted to perfect tenderness, set with all the appetizers, side-dishes, salads, soups, and desserts of the four corners of the globe.

I dined until I was near-bloated, and then I had a lot of sex. I mean a lot. Several hours later, laying upon a bed of feathers, brown and blonde and red haired beauties nuzzling into me like puppies at their mother's underbelly, the Genie stood before me, looking down in satisfaction at his work so far.

'What is your third wish?'

I thought long and hard. Truly, this last wish tasked the very limits of my imagination, my beliefs, my ethics, my philosophy. Hours passed in silence, save for the gentle snoring of the ladies surrounding me.

At last, I spoke. 'Genie, for my third wish, I want a big Blue head.' """,A man walks into a bar and had a big Blue head,4

The waiter replied, ” Ah senor, you have excellent taste! Those are bulls testicles from the bull fight this morning. A delicacy!”

The next morning, the American returned, placed his order, and then that evening he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.

A little later, there was a shout of ""TWENTY NINE!""! Again, the inmates in the block started to hoot in delight. Jim was intrigued and asked his cellmate, who was doubled over laughing, just what the heck was going on with the numbers.

We numbered them so that they're easier to tell! You can shout out a number, and every inmate in this building will know what joke you're talking about!""

""You're pulling my leg!"", said Jim. The cellmate chuckles and says, ""No, I'm not, man! Look, I'll show you. Give me a number."" 

Jim shrugs, ""Fine... How about 85?"". The cellmate goes to the bars of the cell and yells out ""EIGHTY FIVE!"". The whole block starts to howl out laughing. The cellmate looks at Jim and smirks. 

Jim is astonished. ""Can I try?"", he asks. The cellmate beckons him to have at it. 

Jim gets off his bed and goes over to the bars of the cell. ""FIFTY THREE!"", he yells. 

No laughs, only silence. The cellmate says, ""Try again."" 

""SIX!"", Jim yells. Still no response. ""What happened? Did I choose the wrong jokes?"" 

Jim's cellmate sighs, pats him on the back and says, ""It's not the jokes, buddy, you're just not telling them right.""

But what to do? Where to go? He spent days choosing a destination, whether he would take the train or the plane, if there was something special to think about. The concept of being free for a time was new to him and he decided to let himself guide through the world by going on a cruise.

The big day finally comes and James is ready, he prepared everything that he put in a brand new suitcase he baught for the occasion. He takes the taxi to the harbour and stands in front of a gigantic ship, the size of a building, with as many windows. James wonders for a time how such a magestic piece of metal can swim, but his fears are gone as soon as he enters the line and gets ready to step on the monster.

Once in his cabin, James looks around him and realizes that this room looks like an hotel room and that everything seems as comfortable as any other room. Suddenly, he realizes he had to take an elevator to come here and that his position is comparable to being in the 10th floor of a house. ""I wonder what the view looks like"", he thinks.

As he opens the round window and passes his head outside, he can see his hometown from a point of view he had never seen. And looking down, all the people look like ants! Amongst them, James recognizes Richard, an old friend, and he starts calling him: ""Richard, Richard! Up there, I'm just here!""

""Hey, James, what are you doing here?""

""That's it, I take that vacation trip I talk you about, I'm going on a cruise!""

During the night when everyone in the train were sleeping, one of the gay men got horny. 

""Come on, lets do it!""

""No, let's not""

""Why?""

""Maybe the other travelling people will be bothered and awoken by it.""

""No, they won't! They're all sleeping like pigs. Let me show you. ANYONE GOT A LIGHTER?"" See, no one answered, because they are all sleeping.""

""Alright, let's go.""

The morning after, the conductor of the train asked the travelers if they had a good night of sleep. 

Then, a drowsy and disturbed-looking old man in the back of the train replied.

""No, I didn't sleep very well at all.""

""Why not?"" Replied the train conductor.

""I was freezing.""

""You could've asked for a blanket.""

""I was afraid to ask. There was a guy asking for a lighter, and he got fucked in the ass by someone for three hours.""

So they got a pig and fed it a lot of food. The only problem was, the pig would just start crapping after a while and they could never get an accurate measurement of how much food its stomach would hold. So one of the scientists got the brilliant idea to stick a cork in the pig's butthole to stop it from crapping. The pig ate. And it ate. And it ate. Once it was absolutely full, it stopped eating, the scientists wrote down how much food they fed it and the study was over.
Now came the trouble of taking the cork out. For obvious reasons, the scientists didn't want to risk doing this personally, so they decided they would send in a trained monkey to do it. They set up the monkey and stood back. 1 scientist stood 50 yards away, 1 scientist stood 100 yards away, and 1 scientist stood 150 yards away. Then the monkey pulled the cork.
Well, there was a huge spray of crap. The scientist at 150 yards got crap all over his shoes. He was furious and he walked up to the scientist at 100 yards, who had crap all over his shoes and pants. The two furious scientists walked up to the third scientist at 50 yards and they saw him completely covered, head to toe, in crap. But he was laughing his freaking butt off and smiling.
""Why are you so happy?"" They asked him.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn’t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. 


The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. 


Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn’t listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!""",This is a story of a perfectly married couple.,15

On our first day we were told to go to a nearby apartment building that was still under construction, to place some windows on the 28th floor. About an hour in, our colleague trips and suddenly falls out of the window. Dead as a doornail, the poor man.

""Oh no!"" said my friend, ""What now?""

""I don't know, I guess we'll have to tell his wife about his death.""

""Well, I know for sure that I wouldn't be able to handle her sobbing."" says my friend.

I've always considered myself a pretty smooth talker, so I figured it would be best if I told her the terrible news.

""Okay, I'll go to their house, then. I'll be back in half an hour."" I responded.


Fifteen minutes later I walked back into the apartment with a 24-pack of beer.

My friend asks with a confused look on his face: ""Where'd you get that? I knew you weren't able to tell her. You're just as fainthearted as I am. You should have told her that her husband died!""

""Oh no, I told her."" I responded

""Really? How did you tell her?"" my friend asked curiously.

""So, I went to her house,"" I said, ""rang the doorbell, the woman opened a window and asked: 'Who's there?' So i asked her: 'Good afternoon, are you widow Johnson?' She responded: 'Well, my name is indeed Johnson, but I'm not a widow.' So I told her: 'Want to make a bet for a 24-pack?""

One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals—one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.

First they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.

“Hello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?” asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.

The parrot looked at him, and to Derek's disappointment, the parrot said “Fuck off, I'm trying to sleep you dickhead!”

They moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.

Next was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.

“There is little chance of it running away!” exclaimed Patrick, “we will never lose them!”

The turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.

“I hope it's the Bible!” said Derek, excitedly.

But as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.

Beside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. 

They searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn't recklessly rubbing the Lord's face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken—the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop's creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of “being a chicken,” in the Lord's eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.

They sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.

They said to the woman, “Can you help us?”

She turned to them and replied, “Fuck off, I'm trying to sweep you dickhead.”

Then she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.

She said to the boys “I will help you. What is it that you need?”

Derek asked of her, “Is there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?”

And understanding the boys' woes she said to them, “Yes, there is one,” and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.

“Here you will find the weevil.”

And they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.

But their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world's smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.

They decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called “Fermented Bovine Urine” and the other would be “Greg” for these are the names that most please the Lord.

The first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.

Fermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.

The next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.

Fermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.

The next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.

“Surely” exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, “I can win this competition!”

But whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.

The next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.

Greg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.

The last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.

Fermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger's Wikipedia page.

It was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.

The next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.

As the owner of Greg, Patrick's experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!

He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?”

But the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.

The next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.

Patrick's current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.

He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have I been cursed so?”

But the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.

A week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.

Patrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. 

In his final moments he cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?”

But though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.

'Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said. 
The Receptionist replied; 'Now you have caused some needless embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the Doctor in private.' 
The man replied, 'You should not ask people questions in a roomful of strangers if the answer could embarrass anyone.' The man then decided to walk out, waited several minutes and then re-entered. 
The Receptionist smiled smugly and asked, 'Yes??'

Exiting the bank, they hear sirens and see several cop cars round the corner, so they dash into a small alleyway.

The cops are quick though, and are just about to reach the entrance. There are three empty potato sacks lying against the wall.

""Quick! Hide!"" The brunette says, and the three women each crawl into a bag.

A police man comes down the alleyway, looking around for any signs of the women. The potato sacks stick out to him-so he gives the one with the redhead a kick.

""Meow!"" goes the redhead, doing her best imitation of a cat.

""Just an alley cat..."" The police officer mumbles, moving onto the next bag and delivering a quick nudge with his foot. 

""Woof!"" Goes the brunette, imitating a dog.

""Just a stray..."" The officer mumbles again, heading to the last bag, and giving it a light kick.

""POOOOE-TAYYY-TOOOEE"" grunts the blonde.

_____

Edited to meet popular demand.

For those who don't get the joke, the redhead and brunette both mimic things that might be in an alleyway-a cat and a stray dog. The blonde however wonders ""What would be in a potato sack? Potatoes!"" and thus tries to blend in by announcing herself as a potato.

The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.

This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of its mouth.

The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a special imported ""Goony bird"" and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate, he exclaimed, ""Goony bird! The table!""

Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, ""Goony bird! The shelf!""

Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.

""Wow!"" said the wife, ""If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing will!"" So she bought the bird and took it home.

When she entered the house, the husband was, as usual, sprawled on the sofa guzzling beer and watching the game. ""Honey!"" she exclaimed, ""I've got a surprise for you! A Goony bird!""

The husband, in his usual bored tone replied, ""Goony Bird, my ass!""

He knocked on the door and roused the monks. ""I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?"" He asked. 

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. 

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. 

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. 

""What was that sound?"" He asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?"" 

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk."" 

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is,"" he begged. 

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk. 

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.""Please tell me what made that sound,"" he said. 

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said. 

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" The head monk just shook his head. 

""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" he said.""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said. 

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?""The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.""The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."" 

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. 

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.""The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.The head monk heard his answer and nodded. 

""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me."" 

And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. 

But, I can't tell you what it was. You're not a monk.",A man was driving in the middle of nowhere down a secluded country road far from any cities.,19

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A guy decides to buy a new Harley. Before he leaves the owner tells him his secret for keeping it in such great condition is he rubs vaseline on the chrome when it rains and hands him a jar of vaseline. 

Over weekend, he decides to take his new bike to visit his girlfiends'  parents. 

As they walk to the front door she stops him and says, ""Don't talk during dinner, the first one to talk has to do the dishes."" 

He says ""Alright?"" 

Still confused they get to the front door and walk in only to find piles of dishes all over the house. They start to eat and sure enough nobody is saying a word. 

So he starts to rub his girlfriends breast, still nothing from anybody. He takes off her clothes, still nothing from anybody. Then He screws her right their at the table, not a word from anybody. A little more time goes by and he does the same thing to her mom, still no word from anybody. 

Then he hears it starting to rain outside so he pulls out the jar of vaseline to take care of his bike. 

Her dad says, ""Alright, alright I will do the dishes.""

post,52iry4,2qh72,jokes,false,1473742239,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/52iry4/paul_has_a_shitty_life/,self.jokes,,"Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. 

The only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie.  Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.

Artie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife.

For Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  

On Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  

Two minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place.

Halfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go.

Artie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and ""Pays"" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.

40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling ""WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!"" ""WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?""...... on and on she yells until finishes with ""WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!"" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  

The next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with ""yes, dear"", ""Of course, Dear"", ""I'll get right on it Dear."" All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie ""It's a go"".

While Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her.  When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  

Little does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.

Artie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.

The next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline ""Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway""

My wife walked by and asked me what I was doing, and I said, ""nothing"". The reason I said ""nothing"" instead of saying ""just thinking"" is because she then would have asked, ""About what?"" At that point I would have had to explain that men are deep thinkers about various topics, which would lead to other questions.

Finally I pondered an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts? Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?

Well, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion. A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""

On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

The younger brother Mike is a real nice guy, but he's kind of a fuck-up.  Having been too busy to catch up for weeks, they decide to meet up at the local bar.

Dave says, ""Man, I'm sorry we haven't done this in a while.  I've been so stressed at work, and to top it off the sitter quits on me one week before I'm supposed to take the wife and kids to Europe.  I don't know how I'm going to arrange for someone to take care of the pets and look after mom with only a week's notice.""

Mike says, ""Hey, I'm not doing anything next week; let me take care of it for you!""  Dave replies, ""That's real nice of you, and don't take this the wrong way... but the last time I asked you to do a favor for me you killed my goldfish.  This is a little more serious than 7th Grade, Mike.""

Mike says, ""I know I've been a real fuck-up, but hear me out: I've turned over a new leaf.  I'm a different man now, Dave.  I have a steady job, a beautiful girlfriend... I only ever drink a little on the weekends.  Let me do you this favor to make up for all those years of being such a dope.""

Dave says, ""I really don't like to do this, but I'm in a bind... so against my better judgment, the wife and I would be very appreciative if you would take care of things while we're away.  Thanks for coming through for me Mike.""

When he lands in Europe, the first thing Dave does is pick up the phone and dial Mike to see how things are going.  Mike says, ""Hey, how ya doin?! ... Listen, I'm really sorry big brother, but the cat is dead.""

Dave says, ""WHAT?! JESUS CHRIST, I'M NOT EVEN GONE FOR A DAY AND YOU JUST KILLED THE FUCKING CAT! THE WIFE AND KIDS LOVE THAT CAT! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?! You know the worst thing, Mike? You didn't even have the decency to let me enjoy my vacation for a single day. At the very least, lie to me, you piece of shit. Tell me the cat is on the roof.  Then the second day say, [bad, angry impression] 'HEY DAVE NOT MUCH GOING ON HERE, YEAH THE CAT'S STILL ON THE ROOF BUT TOMORROW I'M GOING TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT...' At least drag out my misery, you jackass.""

[Long, uncomfortable pause]

Mike says, ""Shit Dave, you're absolutely right.  I'm sorry.  I promise, I'm not going to let anything else interrupt the rest of your vacation.  I'll take care of everything and I bet I can even find a cat who looks just like snowball so you don't have to tell the girls anything.""

Dave says, ""I'm sorry for being so harsh on you little brother.  If you can get me out of this, all is forgiven.  By the way, how's mom doing?""

[Short pause]

Mike says, ""Uhhhh, I think mom is on the roof.""

The next day she drove out into the countryside where she came upon a flock of sheep crossing the road.
Stopping her car to watch the fluffy flock, she called out to the shepherd, 
""Your sheep are so cute. If I guess how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?""

The shepherd was taken by the woman's beauty and said to her, ""Yes"".
So the woman said the first number that came into her head which was ""436"".
Shocked that she was somehow right, the shepherd said, ""That's right. Yes, you can pick one of my flock.""

After much thought and study of the flock, the woman selected what she thought was the cutest and most playful one to take home with her.

The shepherd turned to the woman and said, 
""Now I have a proposition for you. If I can guess your real hair colour, can I have my dog back?""",Blondes CAN count sheep,14

Tom is a known Democrat and states ""Hilary is the best choice for this country, I'm sure of it. There's no doubt in my mind that she will win our country over and take presidency by a landslide. Trump is going to ruin our country, I can't even fathom living in a country run by him.""


Mike, a very educated intellectual political science major, also a known democrat, almost spits out his drink laughing.

""Nonsense! Trump's honesty will surely resonate within every American's heart come election time, and will undoubtedly win! In fact, I'm willing to bet $5000 that Trump will be president by the end of the year!""


Thinking the friend is off his rockers, the first friend gladly accepts the bet.

A few months later, after heavy controversy and corruption at the polls, Trump came out victorious by a very small margin. 

Distraught and defeated, Tom goes to Mike's apartment the next day to deliver the money by hand. Surprisingly, the landlord answered, and Tom explained the situation to the landlord. The landlord responded:

""That's strange, I heard Mike sobbing from my room last night, when they had announced the winner. He then came over this morning to announce his leave and paid the remainder of his rent.""

Suddenly, Tom's phone rings. It's Mike.

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes.""

The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

speak. After mass, he asked the monsignor for suggestions to help him do better in the future. 

The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting 
nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
 
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the 
beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. 

Upon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door: 

1. Sip the vodka, don't gulp. 
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. 
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. 
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C. 
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the spook. 
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the s**t out of him. 
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, 
don't say he was stoned off his a**. 
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T."" 
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper he said, ""Take 
this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me"". 
12. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, Yeah God. 
13. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at 
St.Peter's not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.

 Finally she selects a lovely pink floral print. The salesman then asks what size curtains she needs.
  
 The blonde promptly replies, ""Fifteen inches.""
  
 ""Fifteen inches?"" asked the salesman. ""That sounds very small - what room are they for?""

Jack, a handsome man, walked into a sports bar around 9:58 pm.  He sat down next to this blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV... The 10:00 news was on. The news crew was covering a story of a man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.  The blonde looked at Jack and said,  ""Do you think he'll jump?"" Jack says, ""You know what, I bet he will.""  The blonde replied, ""Well, I bet he won't.""  Jack placed $30 on the bar and said, ""You're on!""  

Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy did a swan dive off of the building, falling to his death.  The blonde was very upset and handed her $30 to Jack, saying, ""Fair's fair... Here's your money.""  Jack replied, ""I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 o'clock news and knew he would jump.

A blonde lady motorist was about two hours from San Diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down. 

The man walked up to the car and asked, ""Are you going to San Diego?""

""Sure,"" answered the blonde, ""do you need a lift?""

""Not for me. I'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I've got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be taken to the San Diego Zoo. They're a bit stressed already so I don't want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I'll give you $100 for your trouble."" 

""I'd be happy to,"" said the blonde. So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts. Off they went. 

Five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of San Diego when suddenly he was horrified!! There was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd. 

With a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.

What in the world are you doing here?"" he demanded. ""I gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo."" 

""Yes, I know you did,"" said the blonde,"" but we had money left over -- so now we're going to Sea World.""

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""
 ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out Of the room. 

A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, But as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, A dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" 

She cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" 

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

Here's what you do "" said the doctor, ""stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response.
That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den. He says to himself "" I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what happens"". Then in a normal tone he asks ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" No response
So the husband moves to closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" Still no response. Next he moves into the dinning room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks "" Honey, what's for dinner?"" Again he gets no response so.
He walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" Again there is no response. So he walks right up behind her. ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" ""Honey, for the FIFTH time I've said, CHICKEN!""",What's for dinner?,2

“That’s great! What about the name of the clinic?” 
Fred went blank. He thought and thought but couldn’t remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, “What do you call that flower with the long stem and thorns?” 
“You mean a rose?” 
“Yes, that’s it!”

First, little Mary explained it with the classic Birds and the Bees speech. ""Good job, Mary"", said the teacher. 

Not to be outdone, little Johnny said he also knew a story to explain sex. ""Go ahead"", said the teacher, a little wary.

""A long time ago, the Lone Ranger was chasing a band of robbers that had terrified a couple of towns for months. They were such a big problem that the towns banded together and offered a reward of pure gold to whoever could catch them. The Lone Ranger heard about this, and after a long chase and a hard-fought battle, he managed to capture the band. The townspeople gave him the gold in thanks.

Thinking to treat himself a little, the Lone Ranger decided to give the gold to a blacksmith so he could melt it and make him spurs and a ranger badge. But the blacksmith was a bad guy, so he made the spurs and badge out of copper, painted them, and kept the gold for himself. 

When the Lone Ranger came to pick them up, he didn't check them much so he happily rode off with the copper spurs."" 

""And that, Miss, is sex"".

Thoroughly confused by now, the teacher asked him: ""Little Johnny, how is that sex?""
