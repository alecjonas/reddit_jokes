When she checked out next morning, the desk clerk handed her a bill for $500.
She exploded, demanding to know why the charge was so high.
The clerk told her $500 was the standard rate. So she insisted on speaking to the manager.
The manager appeared, and was filled in.
""This hotel has an Olympic-sized pool, a gymnasium, a sauna and a huge conference centre, which are all available for use,'' he said.
"" But I didn't use them,'' she protested.
""Well, they are here, and you could have,'' he explained.
He went on to explain she could also have seen one of the in-hotel shows for which the hotel was famous.
""But I didn't go to any shows,'' she protested again.
""Well, you could have,'' the manager replied.
Since the manager would not be moved, she wrote out a cheque and handed it over.
""But madam,'' said the manager,"" this cheque is made out for only $200.''
"" That's correct,'' she replied.
""I charged you $300 for sleeping with me.''

They see Phil walking out, and unenthusiastically wave back.

A disgruntled Andy looks at the guys and says: “Can you believe this? Everyday for the last 6 months this asshole leaves at 4:00 leaving the rest of us to work overtime.”

Joe: “I wish he would help us though, or at least hire more help. I’ve been catching re-runs of my favorite shows on the weekends because I keep missing them.”

Rick: “I know, it’s just not fair. I have kids I want to spend time with, but we have to get this project done.”

Andy: “I don’t care about the project anymore. I haven’t had a home cooked dinner in months because I’m always stuck working.”

Rick: “Well what can we do? We can’t just ignore our work and leave like Phil does. We have deadlines.”

The guys all agreed Rick was right, and continued to work ridiculous hours for the next week.

One day at lunch Andy piped up again.

Andy: “I’m sick of working these hours. I never get to see my wife, and Phil clearly has no idea how long we are here every night.”

Joe: “I know man. I missed last nights GoT premier and I’m having to avoid everyone who watched it.”

Rick: “I hear you both. I’ve missed every soccer game the boys had this month and my wife keeps giving me shit about it.”

Andy: “You know what we should do? We should just leave early like Phil does. Screw working late.”

Rick: “What!? We can’t do that. If we leave early we will fall behind even more than we already are.”

Joe: “Yeah, what are you thinking Andy? Plus we will get caught and could lose our jobs.”

Andy: “Hear me our first guys. Phil is our manager. He is the only one we report to, and how would he even know? He leaves everyday at 4:00 on the dot. We just simply leave 15 minutes after he does.”

Joe: “I don’t know, Andy. That sounds really risky.”

Andy: “Come on. Don’t you want to see those shows you always talk about? How about you Rick? Don’t you want to see your kids play in their soccer games?”

Both Andy and Rick nod their heads in agreement.

Rick: “Okay but how would we— when would we even do this? Surely not today?”

Andy: “I don’t see why not? Rick your boys have a game tonight right? It would be a great surprise for them to have you show up, and I bet your wife would forget all about the games you missed.”

Rick: “Yeah that would be a nice surprise for all of them.”

Joe: “So we are doing it? We all leave today 15 minutes after Phil does?” 

Andy: “Yes. Now let’s finish up lunch and get back to work.”

The three guys went back to work, occasionally glancing at the clock just counting down the time they could leave.

Sure enough, 4:00 rolls around and Phil comes strolling out of his office waving goodbye to his team.

All three wave back, this time a little more eager to bid their boss farewell. Fifteen minutes fly by and as they planned, each get up from their desk and leave for the day.

The next morning Rick, Andy and Joe all meet up at the coffee machine in the break room at work.

Joe all eager from binge watching his favorite shows asked the other guys, “So how was your nights off??”

Rick: “Mine was great. The boys were totally surprised I showed up, they won their game and my wife was so happy.”

Joe: “That’s great Rick! I finally got caught up on my shows and even had time to start a new show.”

Rick: “What about you Andy, did you get that home cooked dinner you’ve been missing?”

Andy: “Fuck no. I was pulling into the driveway and I seen Phil’s truck sitting right there. At first I wasn’t sure, if it was him so I snuck out back to peek through the windows and sure enough he was sitting there having dinner with my wife. I got so scared he would see me, so I hauled my ass back here. We definitely can’t be skipping out early again boys.”",It’s mid afternoon...,3

So they sit down with her parents, and the boy decides he wants to see how much he can mess with them.

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""This joke appears to be a repost.""",A man wakes up in a slum with no idea how he got there...,3

He says to the woman ""This little guy will be the solution to your problem."" with a huge smile on his face. The woman is perplexed, as the dog is smaller than every other dog in the shop. ""How is this little dog going to solve our problems?"" the woman asks in disbelief. ""Don't say that ma'am, this is the Karate Dog!"" the manager exclaims. He sees that the woman doesn't follow, and decides to demonstrate what the dog can do.

""Karate dog chair!"" he says, and the little dog lunges immediately at the manager's chair. Within seconds the chair is torn apart, left unrecognizable. ""Karate dog cage!"" he shouts, and within seconds the little dog rips through the metal cage, shredding it to pieces. The woman watches the dog in awe and feels very happy to finally have a solution to their problems.

She brings the dog home, proud of what she has done and shows it to her husband. The man gets furious and asks his wife, ""What the hell is this?! Is this a joke?!"".

“Wait, you’ve got it all wrong,” says Broder. “I’ll go across the street to get a newspaper, and I’ll leave the dog here. Then you’ll see.”

The bartender is astonished. “Sure, right away, it’s on the house. Say, would you do me a favor? Here’s ten bucks. My wife works in the restaurant next door. Would you mind going in and ordering a coffee to go? This will make her day and you can keep the change.”

“Fine,” says the dog, who takes the money and leaves.

A moment later, Broder returns to the bar. “Hey, where’s Oliver?”

“He *can* talk,” says the bartender. “I gave him ten bucks to surprise my wife. Here, I’ll go with you.”

Just got transferred with work from Leeds UK to our new home in Karratha , Western Australia .
Now this is a town that knows how to live!
Beautiful, sunny days and warm, balmy evenings.
I watched the sunset from a deckchair by our pool yesterday.
It was beautiful.
I've finally found my new home.
I love it here.


September 13
Really heating up now.
It got to 31 today.
No problem though.
Living in air-conditioned home, driving air-conditioned car.
What a pleasure to see the sun every day like this.
I'm turning into a sun-worshipper - no blasted rain like back in Leeds !!


September 30
Had the back yard landscaped with tropical plants today.
Lots of palms and rocks.
No more mowing lawns for me!
Another scorcher today, but I love it here.
It's Paradise !


October 10
The temperature hasn't been below 35 all week.
How do people get used to this kind of heat?
At least today it's windy though.
Keeps the flies off a bit.
Acclimatizing is taking longer than we expected.


October 15
Fell asleep by the pool yesterday.
Got third degree burns over 60% of my body.
Missed three days off work.
What a dumb thing to do..
Got to respect the old sun in a climate like this!


October 20
- Didn't notice Kitty (our cat) sneaking into the car before I left for work this morning.
By the time I got back to the car after work, Kitty had died and swollen up to the size of a shopping bag and stuck to the upholstery.
The car now smells like Whiskettes and cat shit.
I've learned my lesson though: no more pets in this heat.


October 25
- This wind is a bastard.
It feels like a giant fucking blow dryer.
And it's hot as hell!
The home air conditioner is on the blink and the repair man charged $200 just to drive over and tell me he needs to order parts from fucking Perth .....The wife &amp; the kids are complaining.


October 30
- The temperature's up around 40 and the parts still haven't arrived for the fucking air conditioner.
House is an oven so we've all been sleeping outside by the pool for 3 nights now.
Bloody $600,000 house and we can't even go inside.
Why the hell did I ever come here?


November 4
Finally got the fucking air-conditioner fixed. It cost $1,500 and gets the temperature down to around 25 degrees, but the humidity makes it feel about 35.
Stupid repairman.
Fucking thief.


November 8
- If one more smart bastard says 'Hot enough for you today?'
I'm going to fucking throttle him.
Fucking heat!
By the time I get to work, the car radiator is boiling over, my fucking clothes are soaking fucking wet and I smell like baked cat.
Fucking place is the end of the Earth.


November 9
- Tried to run some errands after work, wore shorts, and sat on the black leather upholstery in my car.
I thought my fucking arse was on fire.
I lost 2 layers of flesh, all the hair on the backs of my legs and off my fucking arse.
Now the car smells like burnt hair, fried arse and baked cat.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.


November 10
-- The Weather report might as well be a fucking recording..
Hot and sunny.
Hot and sunny, Hot and fucking sunny.
It never fucking changes!
It's been too hot to do anything for 2 fucking months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week.
Fuck!


November 15
- Doesn't it ever rain in this damn fucking place?
Water restrictions will be next, so my $5,000 worth of palms might just dry up and blow into the fucking pool.
The only things that thrive in this fucking hell-hole are the fucking flies.
You don't dare open your mouth for fear of swallowing half a dozen of the little bastards!


November 20
- Welcome to HELL!
It got to 45 fuckin' degrees today.
Now the air conditioner gone in my car.
The repair man came to fix it and said, 'Hot enough for you today?'
I wanted to shove the fucking car up his fucking arse.
Anyway, had to spend the $2,500 mortgage payment to bail me out of jail for assaulting the stupid prick.
Fucking Karratha!
What kind of sick, demented fucking idiot would want to live here!

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

I was very excited and could not wait.

The cruise began with several uneventful stops along the gulf off Mexico and down the Eastern side of South America. As we neared the south tip we began to hear warnings about the island of Nepredu.

The island of Nepredu is home to a most endangered species of bird known as the Foo. The warnings read “foo poop, although extremely disgusting, brings good luck to those who do not wash it off   but extreme bad luck to those that clean it off”. 

As we drew closer to the island the announcements recommending we stay indoors became more frequent and dire. Several of my companions and I decided to see what the foo fuss was all about and ventured outside anyway.

The birds were everywhere and immediately 2 companions ran inside for fear of the foo scat. Me and 2 others stayed and received healthy doses of foo poop on each of our shoulders. 

The rancid smell was too much for one and as he wiped it off he tumbled overboard and immediately drowned.

The remain companion and I took this as a sign and made no immediate attempt to clean the foul Poo from our shoulders. 

As the week went on we continued to wear the poop without washing. We tried our best to ignore it.

 While gambling one night we made incredible amounts of money and our luck seemed to have no end. My friend, however, drunk on success and pina coladas assumes he was just that good at gambling and could no longer take the smell of the poop and washed it off in the shower. While there he slipped, split his skull, and died instantly.

Seeing this, and seeing the results from other passengers who washed the poop, I realize the importance of keeping the poop.

 I am now a multi billionaire with houses in several countries, boats, and jets. I owe it all to the spot of stinking, horrid feces resting on my shoulder. I have learned to wear it as a badge of honor.

The moral of my story and the secret to my success is: if the foo shits, wear it.",I recently sailed around the world on one of those “once in a lifetime” cruises.,10

They find themselves in a very ghetto neighbourhood and don’t really care, because of how drunk they are. The next morning the man awakes to the sudden realisation of where he ended up and feared for his life, maybe he was already dead. He awoke in a strangers house and wandered around the apartment for a bit until he found three black men talking to each other, confused he asks 
“Where am I?”
They don’t respond but instead tell him this
“The only reason you aren’t dead right now is cause we gangsters are fascinated with white people.”
The man was astounded and a little flattered
“Well... how come?”
“We have concluded that there are only two ways to get shot by a white person. To insult him...”
The men smiled at each other and the leader finished,
“We won’t tell you the other reason for the simple fact that we don’t want you to know, you must prove yourself for ultimate gun-enlightenment.”
The man, utterly astounded, asks them how to achieve such ‘enlightenment’
They tell him that he has to prove himself worthy by figuring out the next reason
They respond by giving him a clue
“It happens in childhood.” 
The man was somehow even more amazed, and even more so perplexed, he couldn’t think of any reason to get shot in childhood, he didn’t want to think of getting shot at all. Or childhood.
“How long do I have to solve this?”
He asks,
“However long you want, ask for another clue if you need one.”
The man agrees and makes his way back home. 
He thinks about this question for a great number of years, and nearly a decade later he returns to the neighbourhood, this time with his friends to see if they could solve the ‘puzzle.’
He finds the house he woke up in a great many years ago and rings the doorbell
The men answer, hardly looking any older than they did a decade ago, recognise him immediately and they ask if he has solved it yet, to which he replies no.
He instead asks for another clue to which the man thinks for a bit, and then answers,
“It happens far too often.” 
Not only were one of the two ways to get shot by a white person to happen in childhood, but also happens too often. His friends were no less confused, the car ride home was silent and filled with curiosity, no one, however, questioned anything.
More than five years had passed since the second clue had been given, the man had given up many a night to solve it. He finds himself at a complete dead end and decides to go ask for the answer, he was clueless as to what the answer was.
One Saturday morning he then made his journey up the town to the ghetto neighbourhood and rang the doorbell again, the same three men answered and still recognised him, the ask him again if he had solved the question
He replies
“No, despite fifteen years and two clues, I have come to no avail...”
The three men look disappointed but also happy,
“We will tell you the answer, we believe that your resolve in discovering the answer was enough.”
The mans face lit up with glee, after a decade and a half he’d finally know.
“The second way to get shot by a white person, is to go to school.”

Now she's sitting there smoking hot and butt naked, they are flying along and he get's a little distracted obviously, then whoosh, the car slides out on a bend and they go spinning and flipping over an embankment and down a hill.

Miraculously, not wearing her seatbelt, she is thrown clear and has a nice soft landing in some bushes. She rushes over to the car, he's trapped in the twisted metal and concious ""You have to get help!"" he says ""But look at me, I'm in the buff, I'm so embarrassed!"" she exclaims, ""You have to!"" he pleads, ""OK OK!"", she looks about and all she can see is his shoe lying next to the wreckage, she grabs it and climbs back up to the road. Soon she sees a car coming so she holds the shoe over her crotch to protect as much of her modesty as she can and flags down the car.

A guy gets out looking confused at this hot naked chick in the middle of nowhere with a shoe between her legs, ""You have to help my boyfriend!"" she sobs, still with the shoe clutched tightly against her crotch, ""What, what do you mean?"" he asks, ""It's my boyfriend, he's stuck!"" she cries ""Stuck, stuck?"" he says, ""Yes he's stuck solid"" she says, he looks down at her crotch and says ""Well love, if he's stuck that far up, he's fuckin no chance!!!""

 My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me—it was her beautiful younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.

One day her “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn’t say a word.

She said, “I’m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.”

I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight for the door

I opened the door, and sprinted towards my vehicle. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!

With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, “We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.”

One day, he received news that it looked like his business was going to be shut down.  Mike worried about it, working harder, but his job closed just the same and, after a month out of work, he was low on finances and it looked that the bank was about to foreclose on his house.

&amp;#x200B;

In desperation, he dropped to his knees and prayed ""God, I know we don't talk much, but I'm in a big way here.  Please let me win the lottery, and I'll go to church every Sunday and pray before every meal.""

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, he didn't win the lottery, and the bank foreclosed on his house, leaving him with just his car.  He lived out of his car for a while, but with no shower and a limited wardrobe, he was unable to get a job.  Eventually, his bank notified him that, unless he was able to continue paying off his car, they would have to confiscate it.  Once again, Mike dropped to his knees and prayed.

&amp;#x200B;

""Father, I can't afford to lose my car.  If I lose this, I lose all I have!  Please let me win the lottery!""

&amp;#x200B;

But Mike didn't win the lottery this time either, and the bank took his car.  Homeless and on the streets, Mike wandered for a time, before eventually contracting pneumonia.  Down at the edge of the riverbed, with no way to pay for medicine or treatment, he gave one last bitter prayer.

&amp;#x200B;

""God, I'm going to die here.  The money would fix all my problems, and I'd be able to get on my feet again.  Please, let me win the lottery!""

&amp;#x200B;

There was a peal of thunder and the ground shook.  The clouds rolled back, and a brilliant light shone from the heavens.  A voice, rich and powerful, spoke from the clouds.

Since they’re in the middle of the woods, there isn’t anywhere for him to go, so he just takes a dump behind the tree and wipes with a few leaves. He then falls asleep leaning against the tree since he barely had any sleep. 

The other man waits for a while before he finds a deer which he shoots and kills. Wanting to show his friend, he runs to his post only to find his friend sleeping next to a pile of his own shit. This gives the man an idea.

 He runs back to the deer and guts it, and places its intestines right underneath his sleeping friend so he’ll think he shit his intestines out. Then he runs back to his post and wait. 

About an hour later, the first man comes sprinting towards the other with a panicked look. He goes,
 
“Dude, you won’t believe this, but I just shit my intestines out and took a nap!”

“No way. That’s insane. Are you okay??”

Bartender says, ""People can pay their $10, and if you pass three tests, then you get all the money.""
""What are the three tests,"" asks the man.
Bartender says, 'you gots to pay up first.""

Second, there's a pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to go out there, and pull his tooth with your bare hands. Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta hop on the job until she's had enough.""


""Well, I know I've paid my $10 bucks,"" says the man, ""but I'm no idiot. No wonder the jar is full, that's impossible!""

Later that night, after several whiskeys, the man gets up his nerve and slurringly shouts to the bartender, ""where'zat tuhkeelahz?""
The bartender happily grabs the bottle of pepper tequila, and hands it to the man who proceeds to down it, gulp by gulp. Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but he doesn't flinch. Next, he staggers out back. Everyone in the bar hears a huge ruckus outside. Barking...yelping...growling...then silence!

Just when they think the man must be dead, he staggers back into the bar all cut up and bloody, with his shirt ripped all to shit.

Wilson survives a shipwreck, along with Dennis, his fox terrier. After three days of floating on a life raft, they wade ashore on a deserted island.

Exploring the island, they soon come to a valley full of wild sheep. Wilson has never been attracted to animals, but he’s so lonely and frightened that he finds himself looking longingly at one of the lambs. But as soon as he approaches her, Dennis starts yelping loudly and the animal runs away.

The next morning, consumed by thoughts of the lamb, Wilson gets up early and tiptoes back toward the valley. He soon finds the lamb, but once again, Dennis comes running over and scares her away.

Weeks pass. Wilson and Dennis are walking along the beach one morning when they stumble across a beautiful young woman lying on the sand. Wilson sees that she is unconscious, so he immediately begins to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. She eventually comes to, and asks, “Where am I? What happened?”

“You must have survived a shipwreck”, he replies. “You were unconscious, but I guess I reached you in time.”

“I just don’t know how to thank you,” she says. Giving him a long, tender kiss, she looks in his eyes and says, “Please, let me express my appreciation. I’ll do anything you want. Just tell me.”

The cowboy walked over to the old-timer, bought him a drink and told him of his great ambition to be a great gunfighter.

""Could you give me some tips?"" he asked. 
The old man said, ""Well, for one thing, you're wearing your gun too high -- tie the holster a little lower down on your leg."" 
  
""Will that make me a better gunfighter?"" 
  
""Sure will."" 
  
The young man did as he was told, then stood up, whipped out his .44, and shot the bow tie off the piano player. 
  
""That's terrific!"" exclaimed the cowboy. ""Got any more tips?"" 
  
""Yep,"" said the old man. ""Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer hits it -- that'll give you a smoother draw."" 
  
""Will that make me a better gunfighter?"" asked the young man. 
""You bet it will,"" said the old-timer. 
  
The young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, and then shot a cuff link off the piano player. ""Wow!"" said the cowboy excitedly, ""I'm learnin' somethin' here. Got any more tips?"" 
  
The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. ""See that can of axle grease over there? Coat your gun with it."" 
  
The young man smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun. ""No,"" said the old-timer, ""I mean smear it all over the gun, the handle, and all."" 
  
""Will that make me a better gunfighter?"" asked the puzzled young man.

He went from doctor to doctor trying to find answers but got none, until one day he found a doctor who confidently said he could help. ""I have good news and bad news,"" he said. ""The good news is that I know exactly what's wrong with you and can fix it with a short surgical procedure. The bad news is that I must cut your balls off."" Now the prospect didn't appeal to Brad, but he really wanted to look normal. After many a night mulling over it, he decided to return to the doctor to go through with the surgery.

The surgery went smoothly and he was discharged the following day, by which time his eyes had settled back into their sockets and actually made Brad look very handsome. He decided to celebrate his new look by getting a suit made at the tailor.

The tailor looked him up and down. ""Your suit will be ready in two weeks!""

""Don't you need to measure me first?"" Brad asked.

""No need; I've been in this business for so long that I can tell anyone's measurements just from looking at them. For instance, I can tell you that your chest is 44"", your shoulders are 20"", you usually wear size 16 shirts but need to shorten the sleeves, you wear 36"" pants and size L underwear.""

Brad was impressed. ""That's amazing! You got everything right, except my underwear is size S.""

""Don't make me laugh!"" said the tailor. ""You can't wear size S underwear. Your eyes would bulge right out of their sockets!""","Brad was successful and mostly healthy, but he had one problem...",33

They change the complexity of the task and other control parameters but they keep getting the same result with D5.

After trying for weeks, they're about to give up and that's when the lead scientist has an epiphany - D1, D2, D3 and D4 all show willingness to perform their tasks but D5 doesn't because he is D5 ant.

Two Jewish men, Sid and Al, were sitting in an Indian restaurant in New York. Sid asked Al, 'Are there any Jewish people of our faith born and raised in India?'
 
Al replied, 'I don't know, let's just ask our waiter.'

When the waiter came by, Al asked him, 'Are there any Indian Jews?'

The waiter said, 'I won't be knowing, but I will ask the chef. After he returned from the kitchen a few minutes later and said, 'No sir, no Indian Jews.'
 
Al wasn't really satisfied with that and asked, 'Are you absolutely sure?'

The waiter, realizing he was dealing with 'foreigners' gave the expected answer, 'I check again,' and went back into the kitchen.
 
While the waiter was away in the kitchen, Sid said, 'I find it hard to believe that there are no Jews in India. Our people are scattered everywhere.'

The waiter returned and said, 'The Chef and the Captain my boss and they all say there is no Indian Jews.'
 
'Are you certain?' Al asked once again, 'I just can't believe there are no Indian Jews!' 
  
Listen, I asked EVERYONE,' replied the frustrated waiter. 'All we have is Mango Jews, Pineapple Jews, Orange Jews, Coconut Jews &amp; Tomato Jews!

Inigo Montoya finally catches up with the six-fingered man in a monastry in Tibet. He finds him red-robed and shaven-headed sweeping the temple courtyard.

""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" he says, drawing the six-fingered sword

The six-fingered man sighs and lowers his arms ""I am prepared, my son. I have been freed from Earthly desires and acheived inner peace. I wish for nothing more than to move on to my next incarnation on the wheel of life. Strike, if that is your wish, I will not resist.""

Inigo's face darkens, he brandishes his sword, steps forward one quick light step, and thrusts the tip towards his unprotected bare chest. A hair's breadth from flesh the sword stops, quivering slightly in the fresh mountain air. Slowly Inigo lowers his sword. ""This doesn't feel right.""

""Indeed for the sutras tell us 'vengence is settled through non-vengence' you have received enlightenment and---""

""No I mean it's very anti-climatic. I spent 10 years studying fencing, I squeezed rocks for 2 hours a day to make my wrists strong, I spent another 2 hours in skipping and dodging and moving quickly to improve my footwork, 2 hours each day of sprinting as fast I could to make my legs fast and strong and every other waking hour learning the sword. I'm the first swordsman to be ranked 'wizard' since Bastia and now you're not going to try to defend yourself? Even running away would be better.""

""I'm sorry but I have renounced violence.""

""You should have done that before you killed my dad. Can't you unrenounce it? Just for a little bit? I promise it won't take long.""

""Well...""

""You owe me; you took my father and scarred me for life, i was only 10. Doesn't your Budda preach making ammends?""

The monk exhales heavily ""If it's truly what you desire, I'll get my sword.""

And so later in the self-same courtyard, in the temperate Himalayan sunshine, they face each other; the old monk and the last sword 'wizard'. Inigo attacks, a dazzling display of passion and panache, sliding with ease from one style to another: Agrippa; Bonetti; McBone! The six-fingered sword flashes and dances in his hands like sunlight on a sparkling Himalayan stream while the ix-fingered man's sword barely moves, dull and sluggish like the estuarine Ganges, spent by its long journey, turgid with the sewage of a hundred flesh-pots, longing for the final oblivion of the sea.

""This won't do"" Cries Inigo, putting up his sword, again on the point of running the six-fingered man through. ""I've lived only for this moment ever since you took Domingo from me. Fight properly.""

The old monk breathes a deep breath and regains some of his composure, again they duel, this time there is some of the old mastery and speed in the older man's swordplay but it is without passion, lacklustre. Inigo disarms him in 5 seconds flat.

""Pick it up"" Inigo says coldly switching the six-fingered sword to his left hand ""I'll waste no more of my talent upon you."" he sets to again but this time without the magical skill of the wizard. He hacks like a butcher, ugly coarse strokes, the sight of which seem to pain the old master more than the jarring impact as he guards. ""You murdering, cowardly bastard."" Inigo sneers ""I needn't have bothered learning fencing for a hack like you, a pickpocket with a homemade shiv would be more of a challenge, you ugly, mutated, freak.""

The sudden change takes both of them by surprise, a fire lights the old monks eyes for the first time in the fight as he attacks, stamping forward and taking the young Spaniard completely off guard. The monk's blade dives towards his heart and he knows he cannot stop it. The most he can hope for is a wild thrust from out of position that can never reach before he's run through himself, but might just avenge him and his father. Then just as his sword is about to strike home the six-fingered man turns his blade and instead fends off Inigo's hopeless counterattack then instantly flows into another attack.

Without thinking once, in a kind of trance, Inigo blocks him and finishes the fight with 3 simple but masterly moves. He transfixes the six-fingered man upon the six-fingered sword Domingo Montoya forged for him with supreme artistry all those years before.

""Why did try to fend off first, instead of just thrusting? You had me cold and I know you were fighting for real then"" says Inigo, dazedly ""not just humouring me""

""Well"" says the monk, with his dying breath ""You always get more karma for riposting.""",Inigo Montoya finally catches up with the six-fingered man,332

This included words. Every day he learned new ones that he loved to integrate into his speech whenever he could.

For example, one day he was sitting at the kitchen table eating his breakfast cereal, when he heard his parents begin to quarrel in the adjacent room. This wasn't unusual. Mornings were usually tense as everybody struggled to get ready and out the door in order to catch the bus or beat morning traffic. The little boy was used to it, because it usually wasn't that bad anyway.

But today, his parents' voices became louder and louder and they seemed angrier than he had ever heard them. Then he heard them each say a word he had never heard before.

""Bitch!"" said his father.

""Bastard!"" hissed his mother.

The little boy frowned and tilted his head as, quite suddenly, everything was very quiet. Then his parents walked in with those usual wide, fake smiles on their faces and his mother encouraged him to hurry up and get ready for school. As he placed his dishes in the sink, he turned to his father, who was sitting at the kitchen island and sipping the last of his coffee.

""Daddy?"" he said. ""What do those words mean?""

""Which words, buddy?"" asked his father.

""The words you and Mommy said to each. Bitch and Bastard; what do they mean?""

His father choked a bit on his coffee and was careful not to spill on his work suit. 

""Oh,"" he said, coughing, ""well those words were...um...they were grown-up words.""

""But what do they mean?""

""Um...ladies and gentlemen,"" his father said, unconvincingly. Lucky that small boys don't take much convincing to believe what they're parents say. ""But you have to be a grown-up to use those words, okay? I don't want to hear you say them at school or church or anything. Understand?""

The little boy nodded, even as he turned the words over in his mind.

Another time, about a week later, the boy was sleeping when a loud thump woke him up in the middle of the night. Sitting up, he blinked his eyes open and listened for whatever it was that could have woken him from such a deep sleep.

Then he heard it, coming from his parents' bedroom. Worried, he scurried out of bed and into the hallway, listening very careful to make sure that his parents were doing alright. When he heard their voices, loud and strong, he relaxed.

Just as he was turning back to his own bedroom, however, he was struck by a couple more words that he didn't recognize. Frowning, the little boy stored them away in his mind and made a mental note to ask his parents about them tomorrow.

""What does vagina mean?"" he asked, the next day. It was Sunday and the family was getting ready for church. His mother was struggling to properly tie his bow tie, when he asked her the question and her hands froze, her eyes narrowing at him.

""Where did you hear that word?"" she asked him.

""From you!"" the little boy insisted. ""I heard you say it to Daddy last night! I also heard him say another funny word; dick. What does that one mean?""

""It means...hat,"" his mother lied, her cheeks burning. ""And vagina means...coat. But they're grown-up words, so no using them--""

""At church or school, I know,"" the boy huffed, rolling his eyes. ""It's no fun not being a grown-up. You guys get to use all the fun words.""

""That's right!"" his mother laughed. ""Now, hold tight while I get this damn bow tie fixed!""

It was no less than a week later when Thanksgiving rolled around and his father was carving the turkey while the little boy set the table for dinner. All his cousins and aunties and uncles were set to arrive at any moment and his mother had declared him a 'Big Boy'. Big enough, at least, to handle the knives without cutting himself as he placed them next to the dishes that she had already set out before running up to get dressed. 

The little--no, the *big* boy was feeling pretty grown up now. He took this responsibility very seriously and made sure to handle all the silverware with care as he set each piece next to each dish and listened to his father whistle a tune as he carved the beautifully cooked bird.

What he wasn't expecting, however, was his father's hissed declaration of ""Fuck!"" as he slipped and made a tiny incision in his finger. He quickly moved his bloody finger away from the expensive meat and ran it under water as his son turned to him.

""Daddy?"" he asked. ""What happened? What was that word you just used?""

""I just cut myself,"" his father explained. ""That's all."" The doorbell rang and he relaxed. ""Go get the door and greet your cousins,"" he ordered. ""You can finish when you get back.""

""Okay!"" The little boy set the rest of the silverware down and happily bounded off down the hall, thinking about the new word his just learned. He was proud of himself because not only was he a big boy, but he was also smart; he knew exactly what that word meant and how to use it.

When he opened up the front door, he saw several aunts, uncles, and cousins, all bundled up in their hats and coats, warding off the winter chill. He gave them a sweet smile and stood to the side.

""Please,"" he said, ""come in!"" They shuffled inside with hellos and 'aren't you such a big boy's and kisses on the forehead.

Once they were inside, the boy shut the door and turned to them with a big smile, instantly making a decision that would show everybody just how grown he had gotten since they saw him last.

""Happy Thanksgiving, bitches and bastards!"" he exclaimed, much to the shock and confusion of his family. ""May I take your dicks and vaginas so we can all go into the kitchen, where my father is fucking the turkey?!""1",A joke I first heard when I was twelve years old so be warned,23

From ghost and apparitions, to science-fiction, he enjoys reading all of them. One day while he visits a newly-opened bookstore, he got a glimpse on a rather unusual-looking book. A thin, hard-covered novel with no title. 

As he examined the book, the owner of the shop silently approached Nester, 'Young man, you have to be really careful with this book,' says the owner, 'the content you will read, is extremely frightening.' 

Nester almost jumped when he heard the owner talking because he was too focused on the book. But with a grin on his face, he responded, 'the scarier the better.' 

The owner smiled for a bit but then became serious again, 'Good for you, but my friend, remember this, no matter what you do... no matter what happens... do not... i repeat... DO NOT look at the last page of the book... it will traumatize you forever...'

Nester nods then they proceed to the payment. The owner say it will be 5000$, and without asking too many questions, Nester hands him 50 bills of 100$. That's his salary for the past 3 months, but he wants to find out what's actually in the book.

The first thing he does after leaving the bookstore, it's running back home. He locks the door, then enters his room, closes the curtain, then opens his new book. 

And because of this curiosity, he immediately turned the book to the last page...

Five words were on that page...

Once he's arrived, the new rooster walks up to the old one and says ""Listen here, Gramps! This whole farm is mine now!"" The old rooster says ""C'mon buddy? At least let me stick around with the old hens? We'll stay in the back?"" The new rooster is adamant ""No way! All the hens are mine!"".

 The old rooster sighs, and offers a proposition: that the two of them race around the farmhouse and if the old rooster wins he can stay on the farm, if he loses then he'll leave and let the new rooster take over. 

The only catch is that since the old rooster isn't in very good shape, he needs a head start.

 So the roosters line up, the old one has his head start, and the new rooster takes off. 

As he comes round the front of the house, the old rooster is *just* in front of him. He is *so close* to beating him. He stretches out his neck and leaps forward, desperate to close the gap between them.

* That's when the farmer looks up from the front porch and sees the two roosters; he takes out his gun, shoots the new rooster in the head, and says ""Damn! Third gay rooster this week!""","The stud rooster at a poultry farm is getting old, so the farmer buys a new one",3

post,admnbu,2qh72,jokes,false,1546897414,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/admnbu/the_mysterious_bottle_of_ketchup/,self.jokes,,"A man wants to throw a party, so he heads into a grocery store looking for supplies. He grabs a shopping cart and combs through the aisles, grabbing everything he could possibly need for the party. 

He's about to head out and he does a final mental check of the things he needs. He realises he forgot to buy extra condiments. He finds the aisle where the condiments are, and fills his cart with everything imaginable. He buys soy sauce, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch, the lot.

Finally, he arrives at the end of the aisle where the ketchup is stored, and scans through the seemingly endless assortment of tomato sauces. ""Low sugar"", ""Garlic and Herb"", ""Low salt""... The selection is absurdly broad. After spending some time looking through each one, he eventually finds a solitary bottle at the back of the shelf which  is labeled as ""vision  enhancing ketchup"".

 He checks the back of the bottle and it claims to be filled with special nutrients and essential oils which  will give even the most visually impaired of people hawk-like vision. Unable to resist, he adds the exorbitantly expensive bottle of mysterious ketchup to his shopping cart and heads to the checkout. 

Being a meticulous spender, he knew more or less what the total was going to be, so when the cashier told him that his party supplies had cost him $240.45, he was taken aback. 

""Surely it isn't more than $225... can you show me the receipt?"" 

The cashier prints the receipt and he scans it, quickly realising the problem. 

""This simple bottle of tomato sauce is $19.50?!"" 

The cashier replies "" Well, actually, after tax it's $20.20."" 

The man is visibly furious. 

""Hey man, I don't set the prices, do you want it or not?"".

Indignantly, he decides to  purchase it anyway, thinking to himself ""oh man this ketchup better be really fucking good"". He heads home and s
