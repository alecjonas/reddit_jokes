 His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.

One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. 

He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. 

He decided to employ someone to run the shop.

The next day he set up three interviews. 

The first guy was great. 

He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. 

At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.” 

The rugby player got angry and threw him out.

The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. 

He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

She replied: “Well, you have no ears.” 

He got upset again and showed her the door.

The third and last interview was with the best of the three. 

He was a very young man fresh out of college. 

He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.

The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”

To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”

The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”",A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears ripped off...,63

post,5trtyy,2qh72,jokes,false,1486974814,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5trtyy/the_french_note/,self.jokes,,"A guy was going on a vacation to France. He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. ""Hi, I came for the french lesson today"" our guy said. ""Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week."" ""So there is no one that know any french here?"" ""No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine"" ""Uhm ok. What does it say?"" ""I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone."" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.

The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. ""Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers"" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. 
""That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!"" our guy thought, and so he did.

Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. ""Let me see"" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry

The match was intense &amp; thrilling. Unlike anything which can be found anywhere else in the world. Afterwards there was a celebration for the Torero (Bullfighter) and the crowd slowly dispersed, with the man leaving among the last of them so that he could savor the experience. 

Once he'd exited the arena, he noticed large groups from the group gathering at a restaurant across the street. Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine. 

As the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.

Curious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal. 

Obviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited &amp; happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.

Though he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.

After a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.

Confused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.

The chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today. ",Man travels to Spain,7

After getting to America they settled down and tried to start a family. Unfortunately after after 3 years of trying nothing had happened, so they were about to give up. 
    As a final attempt they went on vacation to Miami to ""get the spark back"" and while there they met Betty White, who turns out is super sweet and friendly. She encouraged them to keep trying trying since they love each other, it will work out, which two weeks later it did. Out of gratitude they named Fleur daughter Betty.

CLASSIC VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. 

MODERN VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. 

CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? 

Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with ""green bias,"" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. 

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings ""It's Not Easy Being Green."" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the ""Temperatures of the 80's.""

Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share."" Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act"" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. 

Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. 

The ant loses the case. 

The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. 

The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of ""fairness"" has dawned in America.

A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth. 

A young student nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath. 

""Nurse,"" he mumbles from behind the mask, ""Are my testicles black?"" 

Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, ""I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."" 

He struggles to ask again, ""Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"" 

Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other. She looks very closely and says, ""There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look magnificent."" 

The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, ""Thank you very much. That was wonderful. Now listen very, very closely: ""Are- My - Test - Results - Back?""","Are my testicles black? ""NSFW""",8

He then did a quick brain search, but couldn't think of a single Asian guy he knew. So he maintained his composure, and replied calmly: ""Sir, I'm sure you mistook me for someone else.

5 minutes later, the Asian guy tried again to start a conversation by saying:""So, did your dad get the tenure? Or still an assistant prof?""

Nope, couldn't think of any Asian guy he had ever made acquaintance under any circumstance. Probably just some random drunk. So he replied: ""Look, I don't know who you are but you better leave me alone. My father is a lawyer, not a teacher.""

Soon an African guy walked in and sat on his left. The African guy took a glance at him and went:""Hey there young fellow, how's your culture study thesis going?""

""OK!"" the young liberal arts student finally snapped:""OK I lied. I live with my parents. I have a father that is teaching at the same college I go to. And I'm a culture studies major. OK, you got me, you happy? But how the fuck did you know? I don't fucking know you! I don't fucking know any of you! Just wtf is going on???""

By a quirk of fate, the only survivors are two men and one woman from each of the EU countries. They stagger onto the shore of a beautiful desert island. After three months, things have changed.

One Italian man has killed the other Italian man in a fight over the Italian woman.

The two Frenchmen and the French woman are enjoying a threesome, but complain bitterly about the multitude of foreigners on their island.

The two Englishmen are waiting patiently for someone to introduce them to the English woman.

The German men have a strict, weekly alternating sex schedule; the woman gets weekends off.

The Dutch men are fully prepared, in general, to share the woman. However, they are still debating how to ensure that both will have an exactly equal share, how to reduce supervision cost, and how to guarantee the woman equal rights. They are writing to the Hague.

The Luxemburg men are still recovering from the shock of seeing half the population of Luxembourg stranded on the island. But they will soon start collecting seashells on the beach.

The Finnish men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Finnish woman, and started swimming.

They were soon overtaken by the Portuguese men.

The Danish trio embarked on a search for people to join them in an orgy. They gladly accepted the participation of the Finnish woman, and are still vainly trying to persuade the Portuguese woman.

The Spanish men are protecting the virginity of the Spanish woman and are constantly suspiciously spying on one another. Meanwhile, she dances flamenco.

The Austrian men initiated a yodelling contest for the woman. The loser immediately started learning flamenco, as well as Portuguese, Finnish and Danish.

The Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.

The Swedish woman keeps on bitching about female exploitation while the men are sunbathing and waiting for her to tell them what to do.

The Irish began by setting up a distillery for which they expect to receive a substantial EU subsidy. They don't recall if sex is in the picture, because it gets sort of foggy after the first few rounds of coconut whisky. But they're happy that, at least, the English aren't getting any.

You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.""

Satan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. 

Easter Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. 

One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. 

By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. 

By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. 

At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. 

By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. 

2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces ""JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!"" 

Satan is furious. ""How can this be?"" He asks. ""I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!""

Jesus taunts Satan. ""Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.""

""Your computer was shut off, too!"" Satan retorts. ""I guess neither of us win!"" 

God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. 

""How can this be?"" Satan snarls. ""I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!"" 

""Satan, my friend,"" God says, ""You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... 

Jesus saves.""

A month passed and the historian returned from vacation. The artist, waiting beside the covered mural, ready to present it to the historian pulled the cover away.

What the historian saw was an intricately detailed painting of a large cow in the center, praying, with a halo above its head, surrounded by hundreds of native americans in erotic positions fornicating with one another

Fortunately one of the top surgeons in our region was available. When our attending physician explained the situation to him, he asked, ""Has the patient been circumcised yet?"" Our doc replied that he hadn't, and the surgeon explained his plan.

The NICU cut a short length of 5mm silicone tubing and placed it over the tip of our newborn's penis, then carefully stretched his little foreskin over the end of the tubing and taped it in place. After 12 hours they replaced it with 7.5mm tubing, then after 24 hours they replaced that with 10mm tubing.

The next day the surgeon arrived. They wheeled our baby into surgery where he performed the circumcision and then immediately used the recovered, stretched tissue to replace the missing eyelids.

Afterward, the surgeon explained to us that he's done this surgery only three times before but it was always successful, and since it used the baby's own tissue there was virtually no chance of rejection.

We thanked the surgeon and asked if there were any side effects we should look out for.

As there’s no such thing as God, they awake at the gates of Hell. Already the smell of brimstone and black smoke assault their senses and they can’t see more than a few feet in front of them.

A shape moves though the smoke towards them and as it clears they see Satan towering over them with a wild manic grin and all three men are gripped by terror.

First Satan walks over the Person Centred counsellor and speaks in a booming voice “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”

Being a good counsellor he immediately communicates the core conditions and replies “I really value your interest in me but I’m wondering if we should focus on you. I had the sense you’re trying to keep me at a distance and that’s okay”

Satan is a little stunned by this answer and decides to have the poor man dragged away by demons to see if hot pokers can get a more sensible answer from him and he moves on to the gestalt therapist, standing over the man still sat on the ground.

Once again he speaks in his booming voice “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”

The gestalt counsellor seems to be deep in thought for a moment and then begins to speak “I have a strong awareness of something in my lungs and I’m not sure where that’s coming from. It may be the toxic fumes or perhaps some unfinished business being triggered from my relationship with my father… And of course there a really warm sensation in my ass and that’s really interesting because….”

Satan cuts off this rambling speech and signals for the demons to drag him away too with a wave of his hand, a weary sigh and an exasperated look. Finally he moves on the CBT practitioner and stands over him and trying to look as scary as he can.

Again he asks “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”

The CBT practitioner knows that it doesn’t matter what happens to him, it’s all about how he reacts to things. He may have died, awoken in hell and seen his two friends dragged away by demons but so long as he can maintain positive thoughts then not even these things can upset him.

He looks up at the intimidating figure before him and simply replies, “Oh it’s fine. I’m not really here”",Three counsellors die and go to Hell... [OC],0
