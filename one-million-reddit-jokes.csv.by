When she regained her consciousness, she was still pretty traumatized but to her surprise she also found out that due to this incident, she had been awarded with her own place to live in. She thought that she is anyway not getting over her trauma so she might as well go to this place and try to live out the rest of her life peacefully and so she settled down in her new space.

Well there's only one thing to do. Take this cup home, and come back with a urine sample for me."" The man looked at the doctor quite bewildered and asked ""How on earth is a urine sample going to help my tennis elbow?!"" The doctor simply replied, ""Trust me, I'm a doctor.""

When he got home, he first had his wife pee in the cup, but thinking that wasn't enough, he went out to the garage and scraped some sludge out from underneath his car. Finally, as the ultimate insult, he jerked off into the urine cup. ""This will show that doctor what I think of his urine sample,"" he thought to himself.

Fortunately for me, I landed in some bushes, but then some guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!

Saint Peter chuckled again, let the second guy into heaven, and was realizing he has found a way he could really start enjoying his job! About that time, a 3rd man comes walking up to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter gave him the speech about needing to make him laugh, and asks him how he died.

Accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.

“Look at this huge fucker” says the priest, spotting the bishop.

“Language, please! this is God’s house,” replies the bishop.

“No, no that’s what this fish is called, “says the priest.

“Oh,” says the bishop, scratching his chin “I could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner”.

So the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior.

“Could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?” he asks her.

“My, what language!” she exclaims, clearly shocked.

“No, sister that’s what the fish is called - a fucker”, says the bishop.

Satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, “Wonderful, I’ll cook that fucker tonight, The Pope is coming for dinner!”

The fish tastes just great and The Pope asks where they got it.

“Well, I caught the fucker!” says the priest.

“And I cleaned the fucker!” says the bishop.

“And I cooked the fucker!” says the mother superior.

The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely glaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says:“ You know what?, You cunts are alright.”",A priest hooks a huge fish,205

There was also my grandmother's surgical gear when she was a nurse in the local hospital, and countless heirlooms I can't possibly list all of which.

Then, I got to the one that sparked the most memories: My grandfather's collecting hobby.

Every day since January 1st, 1949, he collected ties with funny designs and wore them to work. Some had cats, or snakes or airplanes. He had close to 100 by the time he died several years ago. I remember as a kid how much I loved them, he had stories of what happened to him while.he wore those ties. He had an awesome memory and was good at telling stories.

When he passed, he left them to me. I couldn't keep all 100, and I also gave some to my cousins, but I decided to keep the ties that were his absolute favorites: his chicken pattern ties.

 One day, he wore his first chicken tie when he met my grandmother. From then, he collected more chicken ties to remind him of her. I wear them every now and again, as well.

The first son went out and sold his duck for $5, went home and told his dad what he had done. His father congratulated him and told him to go and buy himself a beer.

The second son also sold his duck for $5. His father congratulated him and told him to go and buy himself a beer.

The third son went out and saw a gorgeous blonde woman on the side of the road.

He went up to her and said I’ll give you my duck if you have sex with me. She considered it and said “Ok”. They had sex and when they were done she said wow that was good, I’ll give you your duck back if you’ll do me again. The boy agreed. While they were having sex again, the duck got loose and ran out into the road.

They saw the duck escape and pulled their pants on but not quickly enough to prevent the duck from getting run over by a car. The driver jumped out of the car and said “I’m so sorry i killed your duck. I’ll give you $40 to make up for it.

When the third son finally returned home in the evening, his dad asked how much he had made.

He said “I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and forty bucks for a fucked up duck.”",Duck a Fuck,220

Luckily, an old pub owner is wishing to retire in the countryside and offers him his old business. The old owner shows him the pantry, the basement, the beer taps and the kitchen, teaches him how to operate the old pinball machines and how to draft the beer the proper way. 

Finally, the old owner tells him about the regulars, who leaves good tips, who tries to bargain the price, who will be hard to deal with. 

“And one last thing, as you saw, there is a Institute for the deaf in front of the pub, so most Friday nights they come over to unwind. They are a timid bunch who keep to themselves, but it’s not hard to communicate. If they show you their index finger, they want another pint. If they show their open palm, they want to close the tab. You’ll get the hang of it in no time. Nonetheless, here is my number, if something happens you can call me”

The first week passes smoothly, the new owner handles everything fine and the business is as great as he could wish for. Finally, Friday comes and he meets the group of deaf men. 

Each one raises an index finger and he serves them a pint each. They really kept to themselves, playing in the pinball machines or watching the game on the telly. From time to time one comes over and shows him an index finger, getting a beer in return. The new lender finds them timid but cheery and no problem to handle. 

After some ours, he notices them acting strangely. They open their mouths wide, and flail their arms in erratic fashion while moving from side to side. He is stumped at what that could mean. It’s not an index finger for another pint, nor is the open hand for the bill. More and more of the deaf group start to exhibit the strange behaviour, mouths open, arms flailing, unrest feet. 

The man finally caves in and calls the old owner. 

“What’s the problem my boy? Are the patrons treating you right?”

“Everything is fine, thank you! But today I met the deaf guys and, well, it was easy to understand they at first”

“Didn’t I tell you? They are a great bunch!”

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your Business at this convention?”

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best.

The poor creature was wounded on the elk's horns and bled out, despite the woodman's best efforts. The man was distraught. This blink dog had become his father's friend during their adventures in the Feywild, and it was almost like his older brother since he was born.

Remembering that an old adventurer had set up shop in a nearby town, the woodsman rushed his hound there to try and resuscitate it. By the time he arrived and was greeted by the adventurer, the blink dog didn't seem to be breathing. The adventurer was ready to break the bad news to the woodsman, but seeing the faint hope in his eyes, decided to try his best. Casting a quick Message cantrip, he called over one of his associates in the building. The woodman turned to see a man in dark leather walk in. His face was hooded, but the paleness of his skin was still evident. On his shoulder sat an imp that grinned at the woodsman as the man spoke to him. ""I have a spell,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper, ""that only affects living creatures. If your dog still lives, it will at least twitch when I cast it. Observe."" Raising a crystal ball, the pale man pointed his finger at the woodsman from behind it. Immediately, a dark fog seemed to settle on the woodman's limbs, and he struggled to stay up. Brushing off a faint sweat from his forehead, the man turned to the blink dog and repeated the spell. The fog, however, seemed to pass entirely through the hound, not affecting it in the slightest. With shaky legs, the man whispered, ""I'm sorry"", and left without another word.

The adventurer turned to the woodman and placed his hand on his shoulder, but the woodsman shrugged him off. ""No, there must be some mistake, this can't be right!"" Deciding to humour the man, the adventurer once again silently Messaged someone nearby. The door opened, and a Tabaxi with dark black fur and a bow over her shoulder silently stepped in. Without saying a word, she knelt by the blink dog, gently feeling its wounds, it's skin, and its head. After a minute of this, she rose, shook her head at the adventurer, and left. As she closed the door behind her, the woodsman could see a single tear on her whisker. 

The adventurer sighed and said, ""Srapes-tree-bark is never wrong about these things, I'm afraid."" His hands shaking in grief, the woodsman simply whispers ""No. No, you're wrong."" With another sigh, the adventurer agrees to humour the woodsman one more time, and calls another person over. The door suddenly flies open, and the most extravagant gnome of all time walks in, striking a pose with every step. The woodsman, despite his grief, can't help but to applaud. The gnome leaps and bounds over the blink dog once, twice, thrice. The woodman is in awe, clapping and stamping his feet, but the blink dog doesn't so much as twitch. Seeing this, the gnome dabs at his eyes with a silken handkerchief before cartwheeling out of the room.

""That was Beedle, and no living thing can resist his charms and entertainment. I'm very sorry, young man, but your dog has departed this world."" the adventurer prepares to see the woodsman out, but the latter asks for one more favour. ""Can I know that his soul is not troubled, so that I can bury him in peace?"" The adventurer pauses, but agrees. He calls one last person over. The door opens, and a goliath of over 8ft walks in, bending down to get through the door. Her robes are fine silk, but cannot conceal her powerful frame. Taking out a book bound in granite, she Whispers an incantation, and gestures around the room with a wand that looks like dragonbone. After a few minutes, she closes her book, and pats the woodsman on the back, saying, ""His spirit is strong, but he is at peace. He is glad for all you did for him"". She then leaves the room.

Despite the grief of losing his friend, the woodsman smiles sadly, and thanks the adventurer for the closure he has received. ""How much do I owe you?"" ""1 000 gold."", The adventurer replies, without batting an eye. ""1 000 gold!?"" cried out the woodsman. ""To tell me my dog is dead and isn't going to haunt me!?""

""Well,"" said the adventurer, holding an abacus, ""It's 100gp for the heX-ray, 200gp for the Cat scan, 300gp for the Fab test, and 400gp for the Massive Specter-meter.""",A DnD themed take on an old joke,7

He named the dog Blackie and brought her to work with him every day. He taught her some bar tricks that the customers absolutely loved, especially after a few beers. Business started to boom and Blackie became somewhat of a public figure. 

One night Blackie was snoozing on the sidewalk outside the bar when a cyclist came speeding through and ran over her tail. She was taken to the vet and the tail unfortunately had to be amputated, but the man, being eccentric and deeply affectionate towards her, had it stuffed and mounted on the wall. 

Blackie lived many long and happy years after the incident, but the day came that she passed on. The bar owner, along with many community members were extremely saddened by the news. 

A few nights later, the man is cleaning up the bar in the early morning hours after shutting down for the night. He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a dog approaching him from across the room. 

""Blackie, is that you?""  

The dog spoke. 

""Yes it's me, I am sorry that I that I left you. But I desperately need your help. I went to heaven after I died, but they won't let me in. God said that he can't let dogs into heaven if they don't have their tails, but since I was a good dog he let me come back for tonight to retrieve it. I know you still have mine and I need it back if I am ever to rest peacefully.""

One day, very tragically, Catfish Jeb's wife and sister died. A terrible hunting accident where he was mistaken and thought he was shooting at a deer. Beyond distraught, Catfish Jeb hurried home to his cabin and called up his church's preacher, Bill.

Bill answered his phone right away, greeting happily in that churchy way. Despite the cheeriness, Catfish Jeb was in tears as he told the preacher what happened. ""Ma wife and sis'ta are ded, Billy,"" he blubbered.

Bill was a little miffed; he hated being called Billy. But with the light of God always shining down upon him, he forgave Catfish Jeb the instant the misname left his lips. ""I am terrible sorry to hear that, Jeb,"" the preacher consoled.

On the phone, Bill and Catfish Jeb arranged a funeral for the bumpkin's wife and sister to be held at the church. It was to take place that Sunday, right before the bake sale. They planned the flowers, the music. Bill agreed to have someone make pamphlets on the grieving redneck's behalf.

I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really. I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing. Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through. I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said ""what are you doing"" ""are you sure, you want this."" I told him ""please, this is what I want"", and then he went with it too. I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like ""Damnit Loch Ness monster!

It was the only tuxedo store nearby so he stood in line. So he waited, and waited and waited. A couple of hours later, it was his turn. The boy approaches a worker there,
       ""Please tell me you still have a tux for me."" The man with a slight grin says "" lucky for you, I have exactly one more"".

      After leaving the store, he runs to a nearby floral place to buy a corsage for his crush. When he gets there, he sees a long floral line stretching across the block.

He approaches her and says ""Please tell me you still have a corsage for me"" . The old lady happy as ever says ""lucky for you, I have exactly one more.""

""Hey! Hi! I've just been released from a human zoo and I'm back where I should be. I feel kinda lonely though, and I think my father was from this area. Can I join you guys?""

The other lions are a friendly bunch, and they waste no time inviting him over, and they start hunting and chatting together. 

""Hey,"" says one of them after a while, munching on a gazelle, ""we should head back and you can meet the others! I'm sure they'll be very excited to meet you, we always like seeing a new face.""

And so they head back to the other lions, and the newcomer is amazed. Lions, everywhere! As far as the eye can see! Baby lions, old lions, big lions, small lions, and even strange bald lions!

He asks about this last group to his new friends and they react in surprise. ""What, you didn't have any lionesses at your zoo? These are female lions! In fact, you're a pretty good-looking lion, I'm sure you'll be popular with the ladies, let us show you around see if you can meet someone nice.""

And so they start introducing him to all the lions, especially to the ladies, and by the end of the day, our city lion finds himself going at it with this gorgeous lioness. In the following weeks, he quickly becomes a very respected member of the group, as he is a great hunter, and he develops even closer bonds to his beautiful lioness partner. Life could not be better.

Then one day, as he wakes up, he sees a strange sight: two lions, both males, going at it with each other. This is his first time seeing a homosexual lion couple, so he's a bit surprised, but as he is an educated urban lion, he decides that there's nothing really wrong with that and moves on. 

But then he sees another couple of lions, and then two lionesses. Everywhere he can see, there are couples of lions and lionesses screwing their own sex like there's no tomorrow. It all comes to a head when he sees his own partner enjoying the attention of another lioness. 

He's furious and confused, and he demands ""What the hell is going on here! Why is everyone suddenly screwing lions of their own sex? Why are you doing it too!?""

The lioness turns back to him, looking understandably a bit distracted, and says ""What? It's June.""

""What the hell kind of answer is that?"" literally roars the lion,""what has that to do with anything?""

""Oh honey,"" purrs the lioness, ""you should know that June is Gay Pride Month.""",A lion is released from the zoo into the wild.,5

The old man explains I know how to gamble.

Impossible no man can gamble daily and deposit as much as you do

Ok let's make a bet. I bet you $500 I can lick my eye.

The agent observes him for a minute and say fine $500.

Alright fine I bet you $1000 I can bite my other eye with my teeth.

The agent took a minute and made sure there was absolutely know way it was possible and said ok $1000.

The old man pops out his dentures and bites his other eye. 

The agent now in total dismay but still wanting to win said that he still wasn't convinced that he couldnt make this much money daily off cheep gimyics like this.

The agent looked carefully and thought hard measured the desk and the distance and finally agreed $5000 but not a single drop.

The old man stands to one side of the desk and pees all over the place. Soiling all the documents on the agents desk and soaking his chair in urine.

The agent begins jumping with joy and celebrating that he just got $5000 from the old man.  Meanwhile the man's lawyer was crying.

She was specifically known for being very overly kind and welcoming to strangers. Some thought of her as just another sweet old lady, some called her nuts, but only a few knew about her past.
In her younger days, she slept around quite a bit. She did all the drugs she could get her hands on and seduced every man in sight.
She had so many kids because of all of the guys kept nutting inside of her. She was convinced that that was her life, but when her best friend was brutally shot in the head just next to her, she changed her ways and became the nice lady she was known as in her village. One particular day, she waved to a rebellious teenager skateboarding past her house. He did not take kindly to her greeting and yelled “You’re nuts!” She said to herself “Huh, funny, everyone calls me nuts. I’ve never tried a nut in my life!” She went to the market and spent a good amount of money on tree nuts, walnuts, peanuts, all different kinds of nuts. She loved every last one of them and bought as many nuts as she could. She was going to purchase some more one day, but she noticed she had no money left to support her family. She had to get rid of something, and eventually with a sad farewell, she sold her nuts. Surprisingly, there was a massive demand for her nuts. She was earning loads of money, and she realized she could sell these for a living. She opened up a business and earned enough money to support her family for the rest of their lives. But that was 3 years ago, and nowadays her company is one of the most well known in the world. So if you ever need nuts, just head on over to Dee’s Nuts!",There once was a lady named Dee.,2
