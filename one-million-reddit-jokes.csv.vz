 One says, ""I'd give her a 7. She's really quite pretty."" Another agrees, and so does the third.

 The bartender, while bringing a new round of drinks to their table, overhears their rating of the young lass. He checks her out himself and says, ""Nah, I'd only give her a 2.""

 ""A 2? How can you give her a 2?"" says one of the three guys at the table. ""She's a real pretty girl."" The bartender, walking away, says, ""Well, I use the Budweiser method for rating women.""

 The guys look at each other, figure the bartender has lousy taste in women, and go back to their ratings. Moments later, another young lady, prettier than the last, walks into the bar, and they confer between themselves and decide she deserves a 9.

 However, the bartender, wiping off the table nearest to theirs, again overhears their rating of the gal. He checks her out himself and tells the fellows that he'd only give her a 5.

 ""A 5? How can you give her just a 5? She's absolutely gorgeous!""

 The bartender casually replies that he uses the Budweiser method for rating women.

 ""The Budweiser method?"" they puzzle, as the bartender returns to his post behind the bar. They are quite confused.

 Three, maybe four minutes pass by, and then a stunning blonde, 5'11"" goddess walks into the bar. Long luscious legs, sexy shape. Truly a work of flawless perfection. Without hesitation, the three ""judges"" at the table determine that this young sultress is, without any doubt, a 10.

 However, carrying a case of beer pass them to restock the supply behind the bar, the bartender once more overhears their rating of the girl. He glances studiously at her, and says that the best, the very best that he could give her, would be a 7.

 ""A 7? How in the world could you give her just a mere 7? She's gorgeous!""

The baker looks bewildered, ""A 'Bum'?""

""No, I said 'Bum'"" says the old man.

""Oh, you mean a 'Bun'!?"" says the baker.

""That's what I said, a bum"" replies the old man.

So he takes his 'Bum' and finds a Pet Shop and walks in.

""Can I have a Cock-and-Spank-it"" he says to the lady serving.

""A WHAT?"" she replies, obviously insulted.

""A Cock-and-Spank-it, you have one in the window"" he says hurriedly, not sure why she is upset.

""Oh my word!"" She says ""You mean a Cocker Spaniel"".

So he pays for the dog and leaves to find an Ironmonger. Once there he asks the gentleman for a ""Fuck it"".

To which the gentleman replies ""A what?"", not believing his ears.

""A Fuck it, you have loads of them over there"" pointing.

""Oh you mean a 'Bucket', I was worried there"" says the gentleman.

So he leaves the shop with his dog, bun and bucket. Unfortunately he bumps into an old lady and the dog jumps out of his hands and makes a run for it, so he turns to the old lady and says....

""Will you hold my Bum and Fuck it, while I catch my Cock-and-Spank-it?""",Old man with speech impediment out shopping,4

They were brothers.

They were in a swimming competition and could not swim because they were paraplegics, which I forgot to mention.

The two both sank to the bottom of the pool immediately after diving into the water, and only one cat was powerful enough to push itself upwards.

This cat made it to the surface of the water and was in last place.

He was sad and pissed off because he was behind everyone else, but he was determined to win.

Super~~human~~cat levels of testosterone and adrenaline pumped through the cat's body, and he was so determined that his back legs started working again. He was no longer a paraplegic.

Using his new ability to swim, he darted through the water with the elegance of a dolphin, occasionally leaping out of the water and spinning, causing the audience to applaud vigorously.

Eventually, the cat made his way to second place, directly behind the man currently in first place.

The cat leaped out of the water and launched a small shock of electricity into the water, frying everyone in it. 

He then landed back in the water and swam to victory.

By default, since he was the only contestant still alive, he won the competition and received a 3-inch ~~fake~~ gold trophy and a 10$ gift certificate to use at Hooters, valid foe any purchase over 69$.

'One Two Three Cat' was thrilled at his victory, but then he remembered his brother, 'Un Deux Trois Cat', and the horrible death he had suffered in the pool.

After fifteen minutes of mourning, he went to Hooters to eat lunch and fap.

Then he went home and sold his brother's corpse's organs to black market drug dealers in return for cocaine.

His life went downhill from there.

He spent the next thirteen years living in an abandoned apartment in Utah. He was broke, starving, and addicted to crack.

Eventually, the Russian Mafia, who 'One Two Three Cat' owed 600,000 dollars, raided his house and shot him to death.

However, throughout his miserable life, there was one thing the poor cat never forgot.

'One Two Three Cat' never forgot how

 'Un Deux Trois Cat' sank.

The piranhas were all like ""hey it's not a fair tournament! The cephalopods always got the advantage! We got good teeth but you can squirt ink and kick us with ya tentacles and stuff!""

And the squids are like ""no, no, no, it's totally fair. Piranhas got more agility and their teeth are just plain deadly, man"". The squids are real defensive of their MMA tourney.

And this nun (who walked into the bar before, remember-bet you didn't remember) speaks up and is like ""hey, why all the fighting? Why do you need an MMA tournament in the first place?""

But then the nun's robe and veil suddenly start talking out of nowhere. Nun's Habits have been known to come alive before, but are usually held back from doing this by a restrictive Papal proclamation put forth by Pope Francis last November-the Holy Habit Constrainment Order, PO #7462.5.


But this nun's robes come alive and stuff and they start taking to these squids and piranhas.

And suddenly things are starting to make sense and the nun's Habit is laying down some awesome new ground rules for the squids' and piranhas' mutual MMA tournaments. Things are looking good.

But then the robes and veil combo, amidst the nun standing around looking bored while her clothes did all the talking, made a suggestion to split up some of the allowed MMA moves per species. It said ""you know what, why don't we limit hand moves like punching and grabbing to the squids, and we'll let the piranhas take all the footwork and agility stuff, like kicks.""

A deathly silence suddenly fell over the room. The Habit said ""what? Did I say something wrong?"" The worried look on its face was reflected by glares from the squids and piranhas alike.

The Alpha Squid stood up on his two strongest legs and walked to the door of the bar. The other squids followed him to the door. The piranhas turned their faces away in fear. At this point the Habit is so confused as to what it said to offend these squids, just being a gentle robe and headpiece and all.

But just as the squids got to the exit, they all turned around, and threw their sunglasses on Squirtle Squad style. The Alpha Squid said, calmly but firmly:



""Silly Habit, kicks are for squids.""

And they all left the bar and never came back.",This is a long one. What have I done....,0

post,39is90,2qh72,jokes,false,1434069067,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/39is90/any_flavor_you_want/,self.jokes,,"Two good ol' boys are riding down the road in their truck one afternoon. As they travel down the road, they pass by an orchard of peach trees. On the side of the road, there's a sign that says ""Peaches any flavor you want"".

The younger boy says, ""Hey, man, did you see that? They got peaches any flavor you want!"".

The older boy says ""Nah, they don't. They're just trying to get your attention.""

The younger boy says ""Aw, come on! Let's go get one!""

The older boy just utters ""Fine..."" and quickly does a U-turn back towards the orchard. He parks the truck next to the sign and says ""Alright, get your peach and I'll wait here.""

The younger boy jumps out of the truck and runs towards an old house off in the distance. When he gets there, he sees an old man sitting on a rocking chair on the front porch.

The younger boy says ""Hey, that sign said 'Peaches any flavor you want'. Is it true?"".

The old man replies with ""Sure is. I got peaches any flavor you want."" 

The younger boy says ""Got any flavored like peanut butter and jelly?""

The old man points at a tree, and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over yonder.""

The younger boy walks over to the tree and picks a peach. He takes a bite, and sure enough, it tastes just like peanut butter. But there's no hint of jelly.

""I can taste the peanut butter, but where's the jelly?"" said the younger boy.

""You just turn that peach on over, son."" says the old man

The younger boy flips the peach over and takes a bite.  The peach tastes just like grape jelly. Excited over this, he runs back to the truck.
 
""It's true! They got peaches any flavor you want!"" said the younger boy.
""Alright, I gotta see this..."" said the older brother as he gets out of the truck.

The older brother makes his way up to the old man's house.

""Alright, he says you got peaches any flavor you want. Is it true?"" said the older boy

""Sure is, sonny. I got all kinds of flavors."" said the old man

The older boy gets a smug look, and replied ""OK... You got one that tastes like pussy?""

With a sly grin, the old man points to a tree and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over there.""

The older boy walks to the tree and picks a peach. He hesitates, but then takes a big bite. He's disgusted by the taste.

""Ugh, this tastes like shit!"" says the older boy

From the distance, he hears the old man yell ""WELL, TURN IT OVER!""

Finally one doctor discovers the solution.  He calls the guy into his office and says, ""I have found the cause of your headaches, but you're not going to like the solution.  Your headaches are caused by your testicles pressing against your spinal column, and the only cure is to have your testicles surgically removed.""
This, of course, freaks the guy out, but he finally agrees because it's the only way to get rid of his debilitating headaches.  After the surgery, sure enough, the headaches are gone.  The guy is upset about the loss of his testicles, but ecstatic that the headaches are gone, and feels like a new man.  In fact, he feels so good, that he decides to celebrate by buying some new clothes.
He walks into a tailor shop and says to the old tailor, ""I've just had a big change in my life, and I would like to buy a new suit.""
The tailor looks the guy over and says, ""OK, 44 long.""
The guy responds, ""That's exactly right!  How did you know my size by just looking at me?""
The tailor says, ""Hey, I've been doing this for 60 years.""
The guy says, ""OK, well, I also need a new shirt to go with my new suit.""
The tailor looks at him again.  ""OK, 16 neck and 33 sleeves.""
The guy is once again amazed.  ""That's unbelievable!  You are exactly right!  I can't believe you can do that.""
The tailor shrugs, ""Hey, I've been doing this for 60 years.""
The guy adds, ""Well, now that I have a new suit and a new shirt, I also need some new underwear.""
The tailor looks again, ""OK, 34 waist.""
The guy pauses for a second and then says, ""Well you were right about the suit and shirt, but I'm afraid you're a bit off on the underwear.  I wear a size 28.""
The tailor looks puzzled and then says, ""No, you wear a 34.""
The guy responds, ""No, really, I wear a 28.""
The tailor says, ""Look, I've been doing this for 60 years. I'm telling you that you wear a 34!""
The guy says, ""Look buddy, I oughta know what size I wear.  I've been wearing a size 28 underwear my whole life!""

As the lawyer was climbing the fence to retrieve the duck, the old farmer came riding up on his tractor, saying, ""Hey, you can't come on my property without my permission!""  The lawyer explained that he was duck hunting and his duck landed on the farmer's property.  The farmer said, ""Too bad.  My property.  My duck.  Get off my land.""  The lawyer chuckled and said, ""You foolish old man.  I am a successful lawyer from a large law firm in New York City.  With one phone call, I could tie you up in litigation for years and probably end up owning your farm!""  The old farmer calmly responded, ""I guess you don't know how we do things down here.  We settle disputes like this with the 3-kick rule.""  The lawyer asked, ""Oh yeah?  How does that work?""  The farmer explained, ""Well, first I kick you three times, and then you kick me three times, and then I kick you again, and so on, until someone gives up.""  The lawyer looked at the old farmer, thought about it, and agreed.  So the old farmer got down from his tractor, walked up to the lawyer, pulled back his steel-toed boot, and kicked him squarely in the groin, dropping the lawyer to his knees. After a minute, the farmer approached him again, pulled back his boot again, and let the lawyer have it right on the side of the head, flattening him on the ground.  The farmer paused again, stood over the lawyer, and then stomped his boot down on the lawyer's stomach, as hard as he could.  The lawyer could hardly breathe at this point, but he finally struggled to his feet and said, ""OK, now it's my turn.""  The farmer looked at him and said, ""Nah, I give up.  You can have the duck.""",The 3-kick rule,0

While suffering the agonies of impending death, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favourite cheese scones wafting up the stairs. He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed. Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and, with even greater effort, gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs. 

With laboured breath, he leaned against the doorframe, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for deaths agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven, for there, spread out upon the waxed paper of the the kitchen table, were dozens of his favourite scones. 

Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted Irish wife of sixty years, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?

Mustering one great effort, he threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted. He could almost taste the cheese scone before it was in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to the nearest scone at the edge of the table, when his hand was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife...

""Clear off"" she said, ""They're for the funeral.""",Seen this one in the paper... gave me a giggle,692

Transphobia is ethimologically the term of having an irrational fear of transgender people, but is widly used to caracterise all discrimination of transgender people. To understand it, we need to first understand who are trans people.


**First part : Who are transgender people.**


To understand that transgender have the same right and be treated as equals, it is first important to understand who they are and not just limit oneself to the clichés that are propaged by our popular culture : Transgender actually cover many situation related to one's gender identity or gender expression. While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. 


Transsexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth, and desire to live and be accepted as such
Transsexual people may undergo gender transition, the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman. Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre-transition life, and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness.
The process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often (but not always) includes hormone replacement therapy or sex reassignment surgery. References to ""pre-operative"", ""post-operative"" and ""non-operative"" transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.


*Transvestite or cross-dresser*


A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex The term ""transvestite"" is used as a synonym for the term ""cross-dresser"", although ""cross-dresser"" is generally considered the preferred term. The term 'cross-dresser' is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: ""[A cross-dresser] is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex."" This definition excludes people ""who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons,"" such as ""those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers."" Cross-dressers may not identify with, or want to be the opposite gender, nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender, and generally do not want to change their bodies medically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual People who cross-dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender, so as not to be detected as a cross-dresser, or may be indifferent.
The term ""transvestite"" and the associated outdated term ""transvestism"" are conceptually different from the term ""transvestic fetishism"", as ""transvestic fetishist"" describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes. In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes


*Genderqueer*


Genderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality,[55] and challenges existing constructions and identities.[56] In the binary sex/gender system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.


*Androgyne*


An androgyne is a person who cannot be classified into the typical gender roles of their society; androgyny is independent of orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhibiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include pangender, ambigender, non-gendered, agender, gender fluid or intergender. Androgyny can be either physical or psychological and is independent of birth sex. Occasionally, non-androgynous people adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.
The term androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual.


*Bigender*


A bigender (sometimes rendered as bi-gender, dual gender, or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles. Such individuals fluidly move between two distinct personalities depending on context: whereas androgynous people retain the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, bigendered people consciously or unconsciously change their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine or vice versa.
Drag kings and queens
Drag is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the terms drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.


**Second part  : Why the hate.**


The mechanisms of Transphobia are still debated :

The transfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues in her book Whipping Girl that transphobia is rooted in sexism. She locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls ""oppositional sexism"", the belief that male and female are ""rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires"". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with ""traditional sexism"", the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.



The transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary. Norton writes that the ""male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends""


For my part, i think it is the same phenomen that all form of discrimination and that people just fear and hate what they resent as not being identical to what they were accustomed to. But whatever is the phenomen, the consequences are what really matter.


**The result : Discrimination**

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia, is a common occurrence for trans people. Every 3 days a murder of a trans person is reported, and many murders are believed to go unreported. Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and ""in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.

One of the most famous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a young trans man who was raped and murdered by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth. The events became internationally known when told in the feature film Boys Don't Cry, which earned Hilary Swank an Academy Award for best actress.

The fact is that people with unclear gender identity ressent exclusion and discrimination which can affect their well being and social condition, which is why i am writting this essay (or more precisely, pasting it from wikipedia), which you should understand by now is the actual joke related to the late planetside ban affair in which the banned had to write an essay to be unbanned, and you actually didnt have to read all this to catch.",How many traps does it take to change a lightbulb.

Now this young man had what I would call a trailer-park demeanor. He looked from side to side as he approached the pump, spitting chew out onto the ground as he wiped his trucker cap across the shoulder of a ratty t-shirt. He looked back at me once with a big evil grin, showing yellow teeth and a scar on his upper lip. 

He looked back at the pump and started to mutter some nonsense in hillbilly-NASCAR speak; apparently he did not find the price of gasoline agreeable. Cursing to himself, the young man began to fill up his tank with gas. All the while, this man continued to speak to himself under his breath - it was at this point that I transitioned from curious to worried, as even the normal words this man was using made little sense when put together. Needless to say, I had gotten the slowest pump and was going nowhere until it finished glugging the gas into my car.

The young redneck was more fortunate than I or just cheaper, and reached to pull out the gas handle - unfortunately, he failed to release the trigger on the handle, and gasoline came spilling out all over the side of his truck and the redneck himself. 

The cussing began in earnest at this point. He yelled a loud ""FUCK THIS HERE KAMA-SUTRA BULLSHIT"", which I still don't know the meaning of, save that this man was angry. The redneck marched away from the pump and into the convenience store, where he appeared to belligerently berate the poor Pakistani attendant. This went on for some time, and I had finally finished pumping my gas when the redneck returned in vitriolic fashion to his truck, swearing again under his breath; this time about some Ay-Rab Jew mongrel and something about hooker tits. 

Feeling that the best of the show was over, I finally got in my car to leave. Just as I buckled up, I noticed that the redneck had lit a cigarette next to his truck. I quickly fumbled for my keys - I was not going to be brought to the gates of hell alongside this moron, and sure enough the young man flicked his cigarette on the ground.

The flame lashed up his gas-stained jeans and shirt as soon as the ember touched the soiled concrete. He had not spilled much on his clothes; the majority of the gas had apparently spilled onto his arm and hand. The man raised his arm in terror, shrieking as it was fully engulfed in flame. I was frozen in shock, and before I could recover from my cowardice a police officer raced passed my car and dragged the man away from the gas pumps. He quickly made the man roll on the ground and the fire was out before it could spread to the man's face, or worse, the rest of us in the gas station parking lot.

The officer walked over to me and several other witnesses, and he asked us to stick around to give a testimony over what happened. I did so, and told him just what I've said here - minus the mongrel and hooker tits stuff. 

The officer released us and I was just about to go when I saw that he was writing the redneck a ticket. I have to admit - I was curious. I politely walked back up to the officer and asked, ""Excuse me sir, it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but notice that you were writing this man a ticket. Given that he just went through a such a terrifying experience, do you mind me asking what he did to deserve a ticket?""

The officer apparently didn't mind me asking at all. ""I don't like to do it son, but the law is the law. You can't just go around anywhere waving a firearm.""

Shocked that the old man spoke english, the traveler told him about his dilemma and through some slight coaxing, was invited inside. The old man and his daughter were sitting down to eat. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The old man saw the traveler staring and whacked him with a spoon.

""YOU MAY BE GUEST, BUT YOU SEX MY DAUGHTER I GIVE YOU THE THREE ANCIENT TORTURE""

The traveler promised not to even glance at the girl. And off to bed he went in the guest room at the very top of the tower. Low and behold, 4 hours later the daughter was crawling into bed with him. ""What the hell"" he thought. And they made passionate love.

The next morning the traveler woke up with a heavy feeling on his chest. He opened his eyes and saw a rock with a not on it. ""TORTURE 1: ROCK ON CHEST"". The traveler laughed. the stupid old man calls THIS torture? He would gladly take on these three tortures if they were all this silly. So he stood up and decided to throw the rock out the window, as it was heavy and he didn't want to carry it down stairs. Or leave it in the room and leave in shame.

Out the window the rock went. The traveler then felt something odd. Something was crawling up his thigh...
He noticed another note dragging across the floor, attached to some thin piano wire, towards him. The not said in large, bold print,  ""TORTURE 2: LEFT TESTICLE TIED TO ROCK""

Thinking quickly the traveler jumped out the window. Broken bones sounded better than castration. While falling he saw the old man grinning in the courtyard below. He held a sign over his head that read ""TORTURE 3: RIGHT TESTICLE TIED TO BED POST"". ",The three tortures.,113

The next day is his Wife's birthday, so he takes her to a nice restaurant, along with his kids and Mother-in-Law. As they are driving there he suddenly has to slam his breaks to avoid a collision. As he does so something rolls up and hits his foot from behind. It's a woman's shoe!

Realising he has left evidence from the night before in the car, the man has to think fast. ""Hey look is that Johnny Depp!?!"" he yells out and points to his right. Everyone in the car looks and starts asking where. As they do so, he quickly grabs the shoe and throws it out the window. ""Oh I must've been wrong, don't worry about it"" he says, relieved that he has gotten rid of the evidence and he won't be caught.

So the family arrives at the restaurant and everyone gets out of the car, starting to make their way inside. Except the Mother-in-Law who looks quite distraught. His wife yells out ""Mom, what's wrong?""

Luckily it is on a newspaper so he can just step on it and throw the newspaper away with no cleanup. He does so, and his dog comes over and tries to sniff of the spider. He says ""No, you need that spider like I need a hole in my head, if you needed a spider I would have gone to the pet store and got you a good one, like a tarantula or something."" He throws it away, finishes his breakfast, looks at his watch and realizes he's about to be late for his appointment with his doctor. He goes in, the doctor runs a few tests,  and the guy's white blood cell count is a bit high, so he sends him in for an MRI. After he has it done, the doctor walks back in and says ""I'm sorry, but you have a brain tumor. We are going to have to do open brain surgery and a few rounds of chemo"".

 However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. 
 By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. 
 MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if 
 There was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills Versus car kills. 
 He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road Kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to Warn of impending danger. 
 They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""

A cruise ship hired a magician to entertain the passengers. Since the passengers changed every four or five days, the magician was able to perform the same tricks over and over. 

Unfortunately, the Captain of the ship had a parrot who sat around and watched the magician perform his tricks, over and over. Eventually, the parrot learned how the tricks were done and would interrupt the act. 

""It's in his sleeve,"" the parrot would say. ""He switched balls."" ""It's in his pocket."" Etc., etc. 

Naturally, the magician was quite disturbed by the parrot but could do nothing about it, since it belonged to the Captain. 

Unfortunately, the cruise ship had the misfortune of hitting an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the sea in a matter of minutes. As fate would have it, the magician and the parrot managed to grab hold of the same floating piece of furniture. 

For 3 days, neither said anything. The magician stared at the parrot and the parrot stared back. Finally, on the 4th day, the parrot cracked and said, ""OK, I give up, where on Earth did you put the ship?""

The men, tied to a separate stakes, are taken before the chief who signals to the first man two options: ""life"" or ""death"".

Gabe, visibly relieved at being given this option, chooses to live. He is instantly taken away from the other two men to a secluded spot where a tall tribal man with a huge dick and a heated iron rod comes and rapes him till sunset in every orifice imaginable. After the deed is done Gabe is brought out in view of the others. He is battered beyond recognition and extremely traumatized but barely manages to whisper out to the other two men, as he is carried past them, to choose death.

Next day the chief arrives and gives the same two options to Will. Will, in his mind, scoffs at Gabe's faint-heartedness, and tells the chief he wants to live. He soon comes to regret his decision when he suffers the same fate as Gabe. As he is brought back the next morning, battered, insane and beyond recognition, he manages to yell out a desperate and almost unintelligible warning to John, imploring him to choose death.

John, reluctant even to imagine what terrors may await him and fearful of being forced into insanity like the others, chooses to die when brought before the chief. He is then taken away to the secluded spot and left alone to await his death. He looks around and there seems to be no one there. Suddenly he hears a rustling noise to his right and as he turns toward it only to see ten tall tribal men with humongous dicks and heated iron rods walking towards him.

The Devil isn't happy with the farmer's answer and decides to get him, so

The first blonde pitches to the other the idea of starting a real farm, with a bull as their first animal, for which to plow the fields they're sure to own.

The second blonde enjoys the idea, but mentions she can't leave also to go in search for a bull for financial reasons, having to save up  money to be able to purchase the farm. However, she gives the first blonde $500 dollars to buy the bull, confident it will be enough money.

So the first blonde sets off for the country and happens upon a farm selling exactly what she is looking for.

She asks the nice woman how much the bull will cost and the woman says, ""$499, final offer.""

Ecstatic, the blonde hands over the $500 and is returned $1 exactly. 

She realizes that having a bull in tow, on route home, would prove more difficult than traveling alone to the country. This was a time before cell phones and she was at a loss of what to do.

She manages to find a post office and wants to send her fellow blonde a letter. She asks how much a letter to the city would be, and the clerk says, ""It's free but I charge a dollar a word, sweety.""

The blonde thinks for a moment and says, ""just write: Comfortable."" She gives the address and the letter is sent.

and sure enough her blonde friend shows up a day later, knowing to Come For The Bull.",Two blondes from the city,13

Earlier this year, a Chinese family moved into my small town. The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, a short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.


""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving. Hold on the that fee, Ling""",Ving and Ling,85

I've suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""

I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?

I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.

So...is this something I can easily repair myself or do you think I should take it back to the dealer?",Suspecting a cheating wife.,11

The daughter replied, ""Well I was peeing and all of a sudden I felt a lot of pressure and then a bullet came out.""

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. 

In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.

It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him.
""What would you like for your last meal, sir?"" The conductor respond as he did last time: ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go.

The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people.

He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.

The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.

The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, ""Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?""
