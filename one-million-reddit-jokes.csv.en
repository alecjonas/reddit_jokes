When he produces his first batch, some Frenchmen come by and taste the wine.

""My, this is the finest wine we've ever had in all our lives!"" one says. ""You must grow this vineyard twice as large, and we will spread the word of your exquisite brand.""

So George doubles his acreage several times over, and many years later he also produces a brand of sparkling Pinot Noir. The praise of his craft spreads north, and some Brits come to visit.

""This is sublime,"" says one of the Brits. ""For ten million pounds, I will secure all the rights to your wine in perpetuity. But under one condition--you must uproot your Riesling, grow only this Pinot Noir, and leave the tending of your vineyard in the hands of my associates.""

Having grown attached to his vineyard after all the work he put into it, George finds himself conflicted. That night, as he contemplates the deal, he takes a quiet walk among the trellises of his Riesling. All at once, he spots a shadowy figure standing in his path.

""What are you doing here?"" he asks.

The man stares back silently.

Lord knows if it was a genetic mutation that kept on spreading, but beards in this tribe were plentiful, long, and deemed holy by the tribe’s official religion. So holy, in fact, that legend had it if one got rid of their beard entirely, they would be smitten upon by God and turned into a vase. The chief of the village, Ebenezer, had the longest beard in the tribe: 12 feet long, and considered blessed by God, which is what gave him his position as chief in the first place. Soon after he was crowned chief, he gave birth to a baby boy, who, legend has it, came out of the womb with a hefty beard half his size. This was considered a miracle to the chief and his village, and all knew that he was destined to become the new chief after his father. His father named him Benny, after his father before him. Considering his value, Benny was kept safe and hidden from the rest of the tribe, only being allowed to maintain his magnificent beard, stretching to almost 10 feet by the time he was only 5. He wasn’t allowed to play with the other children like a normal boy, and Benny quickly became distraught. Flash forward 20 years or so, and Benny had overtaken his father’s position as chief. With his 40+ foot beard, Benny could barely walk or perform his chiefly duties, making him more depressed and the tribe disdainful towards him. One day, Benny had had enough, and determined that no longer the consequence or the old stories his father told him, it was in his best interest to shave his beard to become a normal person. And as soon as he took the ceremonial dagger and ripped the first hair from his magnificent beard, a sweeping sandstorm rushed through the tribe, passing over, curiously, in a matter of seconds. When it had subsided, Benny’s father had found him vanished, and sent the rest of the tribe out to look for him. As he checked Benny’s throne room, he found, at the center of the room, a single hair and a clay vase. He wept, and solemnly told himself, “A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.”","In an oasis deep in the Sahara desert, there lived a great tribe.",7

“Yeah, I reckon I have some advice. Some years ago I was overseas riding through the desert on my little donkey Sophie. We were lost and damn near out of food and water when I saw on the horizon the biggest house I’d ever seen, like something out of Lawrence of Arabia. I figured there might be some help for us there, so over we went.  Well, turns out we’re the first living things they’ve seen in weeks and the poor bastards are more starved than we are. They get to talking, and I get the impression they’re of a mind to eat ol’ Sophie. I’m trying to figure out how I’m gonna get out of this one when a caravan appears in the distance.  Ends up being the supplies those folk were waiting for, just camels and camels full of food, and we all have a laugh and a big dinner, no hard feelings.  Well I’m pretty tuckered by this point and figure I’ll get some sleep and me and ol’ Sophie will be moving on in the morning.  In the middle of the night I hear the most God-awful ruckus I’ve ever heard, just snarling and braying and crashing around. Everyone runs out towards the stable and sees a pack of wild dogs attacking ol’ Sophie, but before we can do a thing the camels in that caravan run in and stomp all over those dogs. Herd instinct and all that...”

“I don’t mean to be rude,” interrupted Jimmy.  “But I was hoping you’d have some advice for me about prison.”

Second guy comes there and speaks: ""We are all very sorry that a person like you had to go. You were there for us all the time and now we will be with you."" He then pulls out $1000 and gently lays them next old man's body.

It was time for the third guy to do his part so he comes there and says: ""Dear father in law, I loved you with my whole heart and I do not know how will I cope with your death."" He then proceeds to pull a pen and some paper out of his pockets. ""I know about your tradition and I want you to have a good life in the other world because you definitely deserve so.""

When she gets into the village, the villagers give her a warm welcome, tell her that she can talks to anyone and photographs anything that she wanted. Delighted, she starts looking for willing participants to do a simple interview.

The first person she's found is an elderly man, sitting on a porch outside his wooden house, smoking from a rough looking pipe. 
After getting the elderly man's approval, she proceed to start the interview by asking him what was the happiest memory he's ever had in this village.

The elderly man takes a minute to think, and appears to be unable to hold back a smile, said:

""A long time ago, a good friend of mine was holding a wedding ceremony for his son. All the villagers were there to help. Some men went hunting for good meat, some helped decorating and setting up the venue, and women were helping to prepare the most delicious food for the wedding. But on the night of the wedding, the bride went missing! We suspected that she might have gotten lost in the woods up on the mountains, so I went up the mountain with 20 other men, torch in hand, to go look for her. By the time we found her, it was already dark, and a storm was coming so we had to camp up there. We were all very bored in the cold night so we took turn to have sex with the bride! She was absolutely beautiful!""

Shocked and embarassed by his story, the journalist quickly change the topic, asking him what was his second best memory of this place.

The elderly man then said:

""A long time ago, a traveler came to our village. He was a very friendly man and we all loved him very much. A day before he left he told our village's sheperd that he would like to buy his largest sheep with a high price. He even offered 50 silver pieces for it! Delighted, our sheperd told him he has the deal. But on the night before the traveler leave, the sheep went missing! We suspected that it might have gotten lost in the woods up on the mountains, so I went up the mountain with 20 other men, torch in hand, to go look for it. By the time we found it, it was already dark, and a storm was coming so we had to camp up there. We were all very bored in the cold night so we took turn to have sex with the sheep! It wasn't beautiful but it was fun anyway!""

The journalist is even more shocked and embarassed, she again, quickly changes the topic. However, this time she asked the elderly man if there's any unhappy moments in his life.

The elderly man stopped smiling completely, his expressions changed, eyes devoid of all things except for tears. He then said: ""A long time ago, I got lost in the woods...""",A Female Journalist Ventures Into A Village,20

The penguin is overwhelmed with gratitude.

""Thank you so much! I'm not very well suited for this climate, and that would be perfect!""

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven,"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace,"" says Misha.

""Thank you, comrades, for being with me throughout all these years,"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something the old communist took his last breath.

Then the three of you walk through the gates and see that Heaven is wall to wall ducks. Friend 1 barely has any time to appreciate that fact before he takes one step ... right onto a duck.

That duck lets out a tremendous quack, which gets the rest of them quacking, and pretty soon Heaven is full of the sound of quacking ducks. St. Peter appears with what has to be the ugliest woman in all of Heaven. He says, ""Well, that didn't take long"" as he chains the hideous woman to Friend 1 for all eternity.

Friend 2 thinks, ""Wow, sucks to be Friend 1!"" as he takes a step ... right onto a duck.

That duck quacks, they all start quacking, etc. St. Peter appears with a woman who is, quite improbably, even uglier than the first. He says, ""Well, you guys aren't too quick on the uptake!"" as he chains this new woman to Friend 2 for all eternity.

Having ample warning, you learn to watch your step. Weeks go by, and you don't step on any ducks.

Hear me out, I’m on to something, trust me. 

1st of all fuck what historical facts you have heard, I did intensive research on the revolution and these are the conclusions I came up with. You can believe me or not.

Many saw the Seven Year’s War (French and Indian War) as the unofficial beginning of the American Revolution. You may ask yourself, why did the War start and by who? Well a great “land surveyor” (hemp grower) George Washington, you may have heard of him, brought it upon himself to gather a militia and attack French forts in the Ohio River Valley. Why did he do that? Simple, withdrawal. Those damn French were stealing his hemp! So he gathered his boys and head out to get his hemp back. Little did he know the French smoked it all, so he went apeshit and attacked forts. He didn’t expect it to escalate into a war...

Fast forward after the war, the proclamation of 1763 was put on the colonies preventing them from settling west. You know damn well Washington and his boys didn’t give a fuck about that. At that time 90% of American crop production was hemp. Around this time Washington became close to his boys Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay. Their favorite activity was puff-puff-pass, which they did every week on boys night out. Anyways, the British started taxing the fuck out of the colonies on Tea, paper, etc... Nobody GAVE A FUCK. The British often gave hemp production write offs anyways. Everything you hear about colonial resistance is a lie. The Boston Massacre was over some hippies protesting the cutting down of an ancient tree. Americans didn’t give a fuck about no politics, fuck you mean?

Now here comes December 16th, 1773. The squad (close-knit group of founding fathers) gathered for their weekly boys night out, but it was a costume party this time around. As you can probably guess, they all dressed up as Indians in honor of the late homie Pontiac the chief (rip). Well, I’m guessing someone accidentally brought synthetic shit and the squad started tripping out. Fast forward, they passed the Boston port and thought there was no water in the sea. In an act of desperation, they took tons of tea and dumped it in the sea, to save the fish homies. Britain didn’t like that. In result, the British started taking the colonists’ hemp...

Mass panic spread across the colonies. People started hiding their weed anywhere they could. This is a violation of human rights! Horrible! Mass unity of the colonies due to hemp occurred. The squad got back together again in Continental Congresses to discuss plans of secession...

The normal belief that TJ, BJ, and JM wrote the Declaration of Independence is completely wrong. John Jay wrote it but nobody cares about him. Anyways, at the bottom Jay wrote down the freedom of all slaves in the states because they knew they needed the blacks to fight against the British soldiers, mostly because the blacks were sober primarily and high whites with guns didn’t sound good. At the commencement of the meeting, everyone left but George Washington, he was taking his post-high nap. A literate slave caught a glance at the paper and saw the abolition of slavery, so he hollered in joy. Washington woke and scolded the kid for yelling and told him to pass the hemp paper (the Declaration of Independence!). The slave was hesitant, but wouldn’t disobey his master (quite sad). Washington rolled the fattest blunt possible with the paper and smoke that shit. The slave shared the blunt with Washington in sorrow. Washington didn’t know he was burning the Declaration of Independence, smh. Before he burnt the whole damn thing, Franklin came back to pick up the document and caught Washington in the process. That’s why slavery was still legal omg smh.

Bone china can stand the shock of having boiling water poured directly into it but earthen-ware can't. So the upper classes would pour their teas and then add the milk but the lower classes had to put the milk in first to buffer the heat shock from pouring the tea.     
As a result, the lower classes were referred to as the ""Pre-laitarian"" class. Those who put the milk (french ""lait"") in first.

The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""

I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?

I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.

So...is this something I can easily repair myself or do you think I should take it back to the dealer?","Dear redditors, I really need your advice on what could be a crucial decision.",2680

Joanne looked at him aghast. ""Your German relatives?!?! Every time we visit them, Fritz gets loaded on schnapps and causes a scene. It's so embarrassing!""

Jim nodded his head. ""I know honey. I feel the same way, but my parents are paying for the wedding and they never get to see them. I can't say no. Also, it gets worse, they want them at the head table.""

Joanne bit her lip, but knew she would have to acquiesce. ""Fine, I'm grateful for everything your parents have done, so we can give them this.""

As soon as the time for speeches came, Jim's father stood up, clinked his glass to get everyone's attention, and raised his voice. ""Attention everyone!

There was some nervous laughter and everyone raised their glasses to humor him before turned to Joanne's understandably confused mother who had just stood to give her toast.

""Uh, thank you Fritz. Joanna and Jim make such a wonderful couple. I know they will have a long, happy life and give us plenty of grandchildren. So here's to them. Cheers!""

In similar style to the first, One-Stone made love to her all day and all night... but this time, she wouldn't die. So he continued. She still was absolutely fine, days of love-making later. One-Stone couldn't believe it. In the end, he had to give up.

A Scotsman, Irishman, and a Newfie are exploring a jungle on an island in the Pacific. They come across a tribe of cannibals and are captured. The Chieftain comes out and examines all three.

""You have nice white meat on you. We shall hollow you out for food and use your skin for our canoes. You can choose to be skinned alive, or kill yourself.""

The Scotsman says he doesn't want to be tortured so he asks for a knife. ""FOR SCOTLAND"" he yells and plunges the knife into his heart. They drag him off to make the canoe.

The Irishman agrees with the Scotsman and asks for a knife as well. ""For Ireland!"" he yells and plunges the knife into his heart. They drag him off to make the canoe.

The entire time, the Newfie is chuckling. The Chieftain asks what he wants.

""Well, buddy, being skinned alive sounds horrible, so I wants to go like those guys did.""

They hand him the knife but he waves them off. ""Nah, I wants a fork!"" They shrug, and then hand him a fork.

The Newfie proceeds to repeatedly stab himself over and over again.  ""**Ain't making a fucking canoe out of me!**""",A unique Newfie joke,4

The people gasped, ""it's a talking, walking cake!?!""

At this point, all the people in the bar stopped what they were doing and started asking questions. ""Are you edible? What else can you do? Where do you come from?!""

The cake, feeling overwhelmed, and said ""yes, don't know, across the street"".

This just brought up more questions as they found out that it has feelings. 

""What emotions do you have? If you cry, are your tears frosting? What's your thoughts on pie?"".

The cake, is now just flat out annoyed, said, ""basically all of them, yes, you mean my twin?"". 

As soon as he said that, a flood of questions came in for the cake. 

At this time, the cake had enough. It just wanted to be with it's new owner. So it sprinted as fast as it could leaving the people in shock.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.  
The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""","One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.",21

One time the two were hunting herbivores together, when thet caught the Rex in the middle of the act. This time its target was a gigantic Shantungosaurus that was about the Rex's size.

Given the summer wouldn't last too long anymore, and that they needed all the prey they could possibly catch, the Giga decided not to allow this anymore.

""Are you serious? You're gonna get wounded too badly to survive!"" the Utahraptor responded in disbelief.

""I believe in myself. I can do it. I can make the thing leave for good."" The Giga was determined to do something about the matter.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

""If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,"" I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth"".

He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

post,bmwgkc,2qh72,jokes,false,1557482821,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bmwgkc/juan_and_his_perfect_world/,self.jokes,,"Juan was a simple man who lived in a small rural town with his family consisting of himself, his wife, his daughter and his son. Juan had three rules for his family that he enforced strictly. Those three rules were: no drugs, no smoking and no swearing. Juan's family was all too happy to follow these rules, and as a result, Juan had a perfect family. Because of these rules, Juan's family never fought or bickered or lied or hurt each other.

One day, Juan's neighbour got curious as to how Juan kept such a perfect family, and he wanted his own family to be as perfect. Juan's neighbour asked Juan how he kept such a perfect family, and Juan said, ""how about you come over to dinner with us tonight. We'll cook you up a lovely meal and I'll share my rules with you"". Juan's neighbour came over that evening and enjoyed a delicious feast, and when they were done, Juan pulled his neighbour aside and explained to him, ""I have three rules for my family: no drugs, no smoking, and no swearing. As a result, I have a perfect family"" Juan's neighbour thought that this was genius, and ran home to tell his family about it. Within a month, Juan's neighbour had a family just as perfect as his own.

The mayor of Juan's city took notice of the two perfect families in Juan's relatively small neighbourhood, and decided that he needed to learn a thing or two from this man in order to help win the next election. The mayor took a visit to Juan's house and knocked on his door. Upon answering the door, the mayor asked to be invited inside to talk with Juan. Juan put the kettle on and pulled up a couple chairs for them to sit on. After making small talk, the mayor went ahead and asked Juan about his family. Juan enjoyed a hearty laugh before looking to the mayor with a smile on his face, and explained to him, ""that's an easy one Mr. Mayor, because you see I have three rules for my family: no drugs, no smoking, and no swearing"". The mayor loved the sound of these rules, and ran back to his office to draft up his new campaign promises involving these rules. The mayor won by a landslide, implemented the new rules to Juan's city, and within the week Juan's city was perfect. There were no more holes in the roads, tourism was at an all time high, and all of the residents were genuinely happy and they all began opening their own successful small businesses.

Soon enough the president of Juan's country took notice of the perfect city, and realized that if he could possibly scale up the city's policies to a national level, he might be able to remedy many of the country's issues. The president scheduled a meeting with the mayor and flew down to meet him. Upon asking the mayor about his policies, however, the mayor said, ""oh no no, I'm not the one you should be asking about that. Let me introduce you to my friend Juan; they're his rules, and he'll tell you all about them"". The mayor gave the president directions to Juan's place, and the president set off in his limo. The president arrived, walked up to Juan's front door flanked by his security detail, and knocked on Juan's door. Upon Juan answering the door, the president began speaking, ""Juan, I'll keep this short and sweet; I'm looking to make some fundamental changes to this country, and I was told that you could provide me with some valuable insight"". Juan was confounded by the presence of the president on his front doorstep, but he began to explain, ""well actually, it's three simple rules I have for my family. My three rules are: no drugs, no smoking, and no swearing"". A slow smile stretched across the president's face as he exclaimed, ""Brilliant, Mr. Juan, I'll make you a national hero yet"". The president immediately jumped back on his plane, flew back to his office, and started drafting up his new laws. The three new laws were passed without objection, and the country became perfect within a day. Industry was booming, international relations all turned positive, the economy reached an all time high and unemployment reached an all time low.

At this time, all of the surrounding countries began getting very curious, and very hungry for a piece of the fortune enjoyed by Juan's country. Very soon international spies began reporting back to their respective countries about what they'd found, and all the surrounding countries began implementing Juan's three rules for their own gain, and the positive changes were visible almost immediately. In only hours after Juan's three rules came to international attention, the world became perfect. There was no more poverty, no more hunger, no more war and disease, and no more sadness. Juan was elected as the new one world leader for his impeccable reasoning after a unanimous vote, and all of the past world leaders were more than happy to step down for Juan.

The world lived in complete peace and harmony for many years, but after a while people began realizing that they really missed drugs, smoking and swearing. Gradually, a small underground resistance group was formed against Juan and his leadership, and they began scheming on how to take him out. Eventually a plan was conceived, and was put into action several days later. In the middle of the night, several of the resistance fighters broke into Juan's house, kidnapped him, and loaded him onto their helicopter. They then proceeded to fly out into the desert, where they tied him up to a cactus, and shot him dead with a golf gun.",Juan and his Perfect World,0

“This first machine melts down large blocks of metal. The liquid metal is then poured into a mold that makes a smaller block. That smaller block is then taken off the conveyer belt by this control arm and placed on another conveyer belt. The conveyer belt rolls the smaller block into a machine that cuts the block into evenly-sized cubes. Those cubes are individually melted down again and poured into a mold with 25 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Each penny is then stamped on the other side with the heads side, which completes the penny. All of the pennies are cooled, rolled, and stored for shipping. If you have no more questions, then come back tomorrow for your first day of work.” 

The next morning, the supervisor walks in to see a totally new machine melting metal and stamping pennies. Completely stunned, the supervisor runs up to the man who had just been hired yesterday as he was operating the new machine.

Supervisor: “What’s going on? Where did the old machines go?”

Man: “I borrowed a fork lift and pulled all of the old equipment to the garbage area. Then I brought the new equipment in and assembled it.”

Supervisor: “How does this new machine even work?”

Man: “First, the metal is all dropped into this furnace. The furnace is connected to a hopper that pours the liquid metal directly into these racks of molding trays. Each tray has exactly 50 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Lastly, each penny is stamped with the heads design and moved into the cooling and rolling process.”

Supervisor: “Well this is amazing. The new machine does seem to move faster than the old machine. Last question, why did you replace the old molding trays? The two trays appear identical, although the new trays have twice as many slots. Couldn’t we have just used the old trays?

Man: “Sure we could have, but the new tray makes more cents.”",A man working at the Federal Reserve,27

The bell tower has a hole on the top floor where the man would ring the bell that was forgotten to be patched up.After the construction, he hired a person to ring the bell to inform people when the mass is about to start. 

A guy comes in and sees the long line of people who want the job. He joins the line and was the last person.

Finally, the interviewer (who also owns the church) meets the guy and says to him: “Look, the sun’s already setting and I haven’t seen anyone who could do a great bell sound, and, with all due respect, I don’t think you could do either.”

The man responds: “Oh please let me try! I’ve been waiting all day!”

The interviewer reluctantly agrees. He climbs the stairs to the bell one last time and the man starts ringing the bell. 

The bell was rang is such a beautiful manner that a crowd formed outside the church to listen.

The interviewer, amazed by both the crowd and the bell ringing hired the man.

And so every Sunday the man rang the bell for the morning mass, until one day, the man slips and falls down the unpatched hole on the ceiling and dies. People gather around the man with looks of agony and sadness. After this, the people that gathered to the church decreased significantly. 

The owner who noticed the decrease in numbers became desperate.

The owner again started interviewing people one day, and finally this young man comes along with no arms. He was the last on the line.

“Look, i’m tired of walking up and down stairs, and I don’t even know how you can ring the bell without hands”

“Sir, I use my face. I can assure you I can make as beautiful a sound as the last bell ringer.”

The owner looked at the man’s face and noticed something odd. His face seemed quite familiar, although he didn’t know where he saw him before.

The owner escorted the man with no arms to the bell tower.

“Go ahead.” Then the man with no arms replicated the original bell ringer’s tune perfectly using his face. A bigger crowd formed to listen to this tune.

“Blimey! You’ve done it! I can’t believe it!”

“Oh don’t mention it. I practiced ringing bells with my face since I was a ki-“

The armless man slips and falls into the same unpatched hole. The owner rushes down the stairs and looks at the bleeding body. Another crowd forms around the body. The owner looks at his face and still reckons he’d seen him before.

A man from the crowd shouts: “ Who was this great man”

The owner says: “I don’t know, but his face rings a bell”


Bonus joke:

Suddenly, the dead armless body awakens and travels to the nearest telephone, crowd and owner absolutely shocked.

The dead man dials his brother, and when his brother answers, he says “I’m sorry brother.” After which he flops to the floor and remains still. The brother shouted from the telephone: “ Hello? Brother are you there?”

The owner approaches the phone and says:” I’m sorry, but your brother’s a dead ringer.”",A man builds a church with a bell tower.,12

On my way home I grabbed a handle of captain and a litre of cola. I invited my friend Frank to have a few drinks with me. We ordered a pizza, played some Mariokart, got drunk and passed out. Nothing crazy.

The next morning Frank was still there (he usually just hung around anyways), but I noticed he looked a little pale. We had been drinking a lot so I thought nothing of it. When I got home from work later that day, I was shocked at what I saw. Frank hadn't moved at all, and he looked worse. All the color had drained from his usually pinkish cheeks and his body was droopy and lifeless. I panicked!

I didn't know what to do, I tried splashing water on his face but that didn't work. I tried sitting him up but he kept falling back down. I had to come to terms eventually, I had suspected it since I walked through the door. Frank was dead, and it was all my fault.

What if no one believed when I told them what had happened? What if they think I did this to Frank? I just got the dream job I've been working for and this mess could screw it all up. I had to get rid of the body. I waited until my neighbors lights went out for the night, then I grabbed my shovel. 

Hurriedly I dug a shallow grave next to my shed in the back yard. Eyes full of tears I dragged Frank's lifeless body through the house until we made his last stop in the hole I had sloppily dug. I rushed to cover his body, hiding the only evidence that he had ever been here. Then it began to rain.

I thought it only fitting that the weather would match the somber occasion. I finished my gruesome task while the rain drops hid my tears. A month had passed and I had gotten away with it, no one came asking, didn't seem like anyone even noticed. Then I saw it, a small, bright pink flower growing next to my shed. Right. Above. Frank's. Body.

I couldn't believe it, my mind raced, what do I do? Once again I grabbed my shovel and began digging, I was bewildered at what I saw. Frank was still alive! I dug him out of the makeshift grave, cleaned him off and repotted him immediately in the finest compost I had available. He is still hanging out at my house today, and I still have my job as Botanist Supreme.

Moral of the story being, don't pour captain and coke all over your hanging fuchsia plant. Even if it's your only friend.",About 6 months ago I got a promotion,13

A young family moved into a house next to a lot with a house being built.

The young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers. Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

She went to the front door of the first house, and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to do.  ""Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint my porch,"" he said, ""How much will you charge me?""  Delighted, the girl quickly responded, ""How about $50?""

The man's wife, hearing the conversation said to her husband, ""Does she realize that our porch goes ALL the way around the house?""  He responded, ""That's a bit cynical, isn't it?""  The wife replied, ""You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes we've been getting by email lately.""

""Yes, she replied, and I even had paint left over, so I gave it two coats.""  Impressed,",Summer Job,1
