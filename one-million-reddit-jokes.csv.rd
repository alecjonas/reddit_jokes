He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step.   As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump.   A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful. 
Managing not to yell, Patton sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the hall mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding.   He managed to quietly find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a Band-Aid as best he could on each place he saw blood.

He then hid the now almost empty Band-Aid box and shuffled and stumbled his way to bed.. 

In the morning, Patton woke up with searing pain in both his head and butt and Kathleen staring at him from across the room. 

She said, 'You were drunk again last night weren't you?'

Patton said, 'Why you say such a mean thing?'

'Well,' Kathleen said, 'it could be the open front door, it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs, it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house, it could be your bloodshot eyes, but mostly ....... it's all those Band-Aids stuck on the hall mirror.",Patton staggered home very late after another evening with his drinking buddy.,303

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.
'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?",Getting Married in Heaven,198

About 90% of people got the idea but there were a handful of people who needed to be informed that 'casual friday' does not mean 'wear your gym clothes to work day.'


Rather than talking to these few people individually and asking them to dress nicer, management decided to implement a dress code for casual Friday.


&gt;  button down shirt with a collar
  

&gt;  Kakis or slacks
  

&gt;  close toed black or brown shoes


So one guy (who normally dressed fine) shows up looking like he's just finished weeding his backyard. He had a button down shirt, not tucked in, with dirt and grass stains on the sleeves. The frayed bottoms of his Kaki pants were a good six inches above his ankles so you could clearly see that he wasn't wearing any socks with his black sneakers.


My dad asked him if he had been gardening and he responded by gesturing to his outfit and saying:

So, finally, today is the first time he will enter the forest and hunt a bear. He promised the old hunter that he will hunts a huge bear in order to repay his debt and he left.

Benny was very excited and he said, ""I want a long beard to attract all the women and find a wife.""

The genie replied, ""I can do that, but you must promise that you will never cut off your beard.""

Benny agreed, and the genie made a waist-length beard appear on him. He was very pleased and he thanked the genie, then went on his way. 

Years later, all the women were in love with Benny, and he found a beautiful woman and fell in love with her. However, the woman hated beards because they were too fuzzy and insisted that she would not marry Benny until he cut off his beard. 

Benny reluctantly agreed, ignoring the genie's warning. As soon as the razor touched his beard, Benny was magically transported into an urn, where he saw the genie. 

""Where am I?!"" Benny asked. 

""As a punishment for ignoring my warning, you shall be trapped in this urn forever!"" The genie said.

post,5amtar,2qh72,jokes,false,1478045916,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5amtar/two_friends_on_a_hunting_trip/,self.jokes,,"I work as a park ranger, and this rather lengthy story was passed on to my by a buddy of mine. 

Not so long ago two good friends from college decided to have a ten year reunion. One was a successful certified public accounted who lived in San Francisco. A rising star in his field, he invited his buddy to fly back to the States for a unique reunion trip. This friend was a fashion designer born, raised, and living in Prague, a Czechoslovakian. 

The two friends boarded their respective planes, one from San Francisco International and the other from Prague and the two were reunited in Anchorage Alaska, ready to set out on a four day bear hunting expedition. 

The two men had secured an all expenses paid expedition, every last detail minutely addressed. Hotels, back-country lodging, outfits, weapons, four by fours, everything down to the last bullet was there waiting as they caught a bush-plane flight into the interior of the state. 

As with most hunts, there was paperwork to be filled out prior to delving into the woods, and the two friends pulled into the ranger station late one afternoon to sign the necessary forms. While doing so, they made small talk with the ranger who quickly realized the two city boys had never held a gun in their lives before, much less gone hunting. 

Working an extra hour over time, he taught the men as much as he could about gun safety and hunting, and before signing off on the last form, pulled a map and told the men about his secret hunting spot some miles down a little used trail. 

""Fellas, I've been here 20 years and it never fails that there are at least two griz in that clearing..."" 

The two men thanked him and headed off, ignoring the exasperated smile on the rangers face. Faced with two green as grass hunters, the old hand realized the two would be hard pressed to find his spot, and if they did, the trigger happy buddies would make short work of any scrawny black bear this did come across. Plus, he could charge them the cost of skinning the next day. 

Late that night, the ranger was awoken by a awful pounding at his front door. Since he was next to the ranger station and 'on call'. he opened the door to find the CPA from California an absolute mess. 

Blood streamed down his face, his clothing was torn, and between great sobs he managed to gasp out that a bear had attacked and eaten his friend. 

A man eating bear was of great concern, so the ranger quickly packed his gear, grabbed his bear rifle, and headed off to the scene of the grizzly crime with the CPA. 

On arrival, the two men found not one, but two griz, fast asleep in the early morning. One was a trophy male bear, easily one of the largest the ranger had ever seen. The other was a smaller, almost scrawny looking thing, far more commonly found in this part of the state. Around the two were scattered bits of tent, camping gear, food, and a few bloody bits of the poor fashion designer.

Asked to identify which bear had attacked and eaten his friend, the Californian was suddenly faced with a moral crisis. He was reasonably sure the smaller bear was the one that had devoured his buddy. Yet, the other bear was an amazing specimen, which would look great on the floor of his living room. A true trophy male... 

""Ranger, I think it was the bigger one there."" 

Sure enough, the ranger set up, shot, and dispatched the bigger bear and the smaller one ran into the woods. The creature was opened up, and no human remains could be found. 

And the moral of this story, my friends, is that you should never, ever, trust a CPA when he says the Czech is in the male.  ",Two Friends on a Hunting Trip,7

""Is there a problem, Officer?""

The policeman says, ""Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?""

The driver responds, ""I'd give it to you but I don't have one.""

""You don't have one?""

The man responds, ""I lost it four times for drunk driving.""

The policeman is shocked. ""I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?""

""I'm sorry, I can't do that.""

The policeman says, ""Why not?""

""I stole this car.""

The officer says, ""Stole it?""

The man says, ""Yes, and I killed the owner.""

At this point the officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the trunk if you want to see.""

The Officer looks at the man, draws his gun, yells at the man to keep his hands up and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his drawn gun.

The senior officer says, ""Step out of the vehicle, NOW!""

With his hands raised, the man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, officer?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The officer responds, ""Yes, could you s-l-o-w-l-y open the trunk of your car?""

The man slowly reaches down with one hand, opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.

The officer says, ""Is this your car sir?""

The man says, ""Yes"" and hands over the registration papers he was clutching in his other still raised hand.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a drivers license.""

The man asks ""may I,"" while gesturing with his fingers and then slowly digs two fingers in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the license. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, but one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, stole this car, and murdered the owner and put her in the trunk.""

The man replies, ""I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too!""

When the meeting ends, Zhukov is the first one to step out. As he does so, he mutters under his breath ""Fucking mustachioed piece of shit."" It just so happens that Stalin's secretary, Poskrebyshev hears this. So being a good servant to the cause, he reports it to his boss. To which Stalin replies, ""get him back here.""
Two minutes later, Zhukov is back in the room facing Stalin.

""Comrade Zhukov,"" begins Stalin, ""would you please repeat what you said when you left the room?""

""I said 'fucking mustachioed piece of shit' Comrade Stalin.""

""And who were you talking about?

Stalin then turns to Poskrebyshev,

The wife was distraught. To make matters worse, she couldn't sleep at night. So, she snuck into the morgue and cut off her husbands member, and decided to mount it on her bedroom wall. Every night, she would suck it until satisfied and she felt sleepy. Well, her apartment building had thin walls, and the three college students nextdoor, Cody, Scott, and Tyrone, noticed the wierd sucking noise every night from their living room wall. After a few weeks of this, Cody decided to investigate. He climbed out on the fire escape and got a look through the window of the woman sucking a dick on the wall. Being a single college student, he was quite horny. He told his roomates about what he found out, and that night he cut a hole in the wall, took the husbands dick out, and stuck his through.

""You guys have to try this!"" he told his roomates, ""That was the best blowjob I've ever had! So, the next night, Scott stuck his dick through the wall. He agreed that it was incredible. Tyrone was concerned that it was a little weird, but after a couple days he couldn't help himself. He walked up to the wall, stuck his dick through, and waited.

Until everybody gets called into the dining room. 
By now he's not as nervous as he sits across from his girlfriend, he's not as nervous when he takes a big helping of mashed potatoes, he's not as nervous when the dog moves under the table to continue licking his balls, BUT he still has gas.
After a while he just can't hold it in anymore and to his horror the fart comes out with enough force to rattle the silverware. 
Nobody says anything for a moment.
""HAROLD!"" The mom yells. ""Get out of there.""
The dog slowly go back to the living room.
He is amazed as everybody goes back to eating and talking, they think the dog did it.
A little while later he feels another one coming, bigger than the first. He looks around and realizes the dog is back under the table licking it's balls.
So he relaxes and lets the gas go.
This one shakes the table so hard some of the silverware falls off. 
Everyone is quiet. 
Then, ""HAROLD, get out of there!""

When he goes to pick the bike up, the dude who sells him the bike says, ""Now remember....that's all original leather. You can't let it get too wet. If it starts raining and you don't have anywhere to shelter it, make sure you keep a tub of petroleum jelly with you. Rub it all over the seat so the water will just bead off.""
The guy takes his new bike and goes to pick up his girlfriend. The girlfriend invites the guy over to her parents house for dinner. This will be the first time he's ever eaten with her family.
""I should let you know the rule of the table"" she said. ""There is no talking allowed. The first person to talk at the table has to clean the dishes.""
The guy doesn't think this is that big of a deal until he arrives at the family's house and looks in the kitchen. There must be at least three months worth of dishes inside. They are stacked up to the ceiling, stinking and rotting of mold and old bits of food everywhere. The guy almost throws up at the smell and sight of such a disgusting state of affairs.
Dinner begins, and no one is saying a word. The tension is starting to get to the boyfriend, so he concocts a plan to make someone else speak first.
The guy drops his fork, goes over to his girlfriend at the table, throws her up on top and just starts fucking her in front of everyone. The father and mother are obviously mortified. But even with their jaws on the floor, no one says a word.
The guy stops and thinks to himself ""This is going to be harder than I thought...."" Then he gets another idea.
Without hesitation, he runs over to the mother, throws her up on the table and fucks the shit out of her, right in front of the father.
The dad is staring daggers through the boyfriend and turning bright red in anger. But still says nothing. The girlfriend is becoming teary eyed and covering her mouth with her hands, but doesn't make a peep.
The boyfriend stops fucking the mother and sits back down at his seat, completely flustered. His mother, beaming, also sits back down. He takes a gander out the window, and notices it has started raining cats and dogs. He then realizes that his vintage motorbike is parked on the street, uncovered.
The boyfriend pops out of his seat and grabs his tub of petroleum jelly.

The driver knew it was against the rules but figured, like him or not, who's probably more responsible that Tim Tebow? So he lets him take the wheel and hops in the back.

Once he gets the hang of it, Tim starts having so much fun driving the limo that he doesn't realize he's speeding until he sees the blue lights behind him.

With no house and no school and just a few bucks Sally decided to go to a pub to drown her sorrows. When she arrives, the bartender asks her
""What are you taking?""
""Well duh, a beer! What else?!"" answers Sally angry
""Is everything okay?"" replies the bartender nicely
""Not now, I'm upset""
The bartender, with a big smile on his face, replies:
""Hi upset, I'm dad""

One of the boys replied,  This dog is an old neighborhood stray.   We take him home with us sometimes, but only one of us can take him home. So we're having a contest: whichever one of us tells the biggest lie can take him home today.""

Of course, the Reverend was shocked. ""You boys shouldn't be having a contest telling lies!"" he exclaimed. He then launched into a 10-minute sermon against lying, beginning, ""Don't you boys know it's a sin to lie?"" and ending with, ""Why, when I was your age, I never told a lie.""

There was complete silence for about a minute. As the Reverend smiled with satisfaction that he'd gotten through to them, the smallest boy gave a deep sigh. ""All right,"" he said, ""give him the dog.""",Lie Competition,13

With just a little bit of anger she said, ""Dear sir, do you believe in God?""

He said he did.

""Have you read the Bible? You know it is wrong to put your hand on my lap. Perhaps you should go home and read line 23 on page 157.""

Suddenly, emerging from the surf comes a drop dead gorgeous blonde woman wearing a wet suit and scuba gear.

She approaches the stunned man and says to him, ""Tell me how long has it been since you've had a cigarette?""

""Ten years,"" replies the Irishman.

With that, she reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls out a pack of fresh cigarettes. He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, ""Faith and begorah! Is that good!""

""And how long has it been since you've had a sip of good Irish Whiskey?"" she asks him.

Trembling, the castaway replies,  ""Ten years.""

She reaches over, unzips her right sleeve, pulls out a flask and hands it to him. He opens the flask, takes a long swig and says,   ""Tis absolutely fantastic!""

At this point she starts slowly unzipping the long zipper that runs down the front of her wet suit, looks at the man and asks, ""And how long has it been since you've played around?""

Someone would say a number, usually between 3-4 digits long, and everyone would laugh. Then another person would say another number and everyone would laugh again.

It went on like this for about ten minutes before he asked someone what was happening. ""Oh we're telling jokes"" he replied. ""But we've all heard them all already so many times that there's no point telling the whole joke, we just say the number and we all remember which joke that number refers to"". He then said to the group ""oh hey guys, #348!!"" And everyone roared in hysterics.

The new guy thought this was bizarre but really wanted to get to know everyone and make friends so he tried to join in. He picked a number at random and said it to the group, ""what about #289!""

Everybody groaned and rolled their eyes. The new guy was confused and didn't understand why they didn't laugh so he asked the other guy why they didn't like the joke. ""Did I pick a bad number?"" he asked.

not a fuck to sell

not 2 or 1,

Looked left, looked right
looked all around,
and once again
no fuck was found.

I may just spend
every day I live,
trying to find

These have been going on for years –and they just keep getting worse. When the headaches strike the poor man can’t work, he can’t sleep, he can’t bare light or sounds or even touch. The poor guy sees doctor after doctor and tries every therapy from yoga to prescription pain killers . . . nothing helps.

Finally the man hears of special clinic in Switzerland. He makes an appointment, flies to Switzerland, sees the doctor and gets examined up and down . . . they touch him, poke him, scan him . . . . they give him reflex tests and gagging tests and neurological tests and tests he has no idea what the purpose is. Finally, the doctor comes to him and says, “We have good news and bad news.” The man, thinking he must have a brain tumor or cancer responds, “Just tell me doc, what’s the bad news? How long do I got?”

“No, you don’t understand,” the doctor says, “we can cure your headaches.” “You can!” the man exclaims, “that’s the best news in the world!!” But the doctor goes on, “to cure you, we need to castrate you.”

The patient reflexively covers his genitals and says that he has to think about this. He flies home, but it is no use. The headaches are worse than ever. He can’t eat, he can’t sleep – he can’t have sex. Finally he calls the clinic and arranges for the procedure.

The operation is a success. The man recuperates in Switzerland for a few weeks and prepares to go home. On his last day in the country he wanders into a small tailor shop and orders a custom suite to celebrate his new, pain free life. The tailor, an old Jewish guy measures his waist and chest, his arms and neck and wrists, his inseam and his outseam, everything . . . finally, after all the measurements, the tailor asks, a little delicately, “Which way do you hang?” “What?” the man asks, “What do you mean?”

“Your testicles – do you let then hang on the left or the right?”
“Oh, I had them surgically removed.”
“I’m sorry, but before that, how did your tailor do your suites?”
“One on either side,” the man replied.
“Really!” Exclaimed the tailor, “You must have had terrible headaches”",[Long]A man is having terrible headaches,8

The brunette arrives at the man’s ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less.
After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news.
She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.""

There is a beautiful forest scene with a big windy river and lots of trees. Something like you would see in Alaska. Above this river is a fly just buzzing around, and in the river there is a salmon just swimming around. The salmon thinks to himself, ""Hmm, if this fly just flies a bit closer to the water I can jump out and have a meal!"". Meanwhile, there is a bear watching this. The bear thinks to himself, ""Well if I dive in now that salmon will swim away, but I see he is looking at the fly, so when he goes for the fly, I'll go for the salmon."" As this is happening there is a hunter out and he notices the rustling of the bushes. The hunter can't quite see around the bend of the river, but he knows the bear is there. He sees this salmon swimming around. He thinks to himself, ""Hmm that bear is probably waiting to dive after that salmon. I'll take my shot when he goes for it."" The hunter sits down and as he is watching down his scope, a little mouse comes by and sees the hunter's lunch. The mouse thinks to himself, ""I could probably take the hunter's cheese, but if I go now he'll notice me for sure. I'll rush in when he takes his shot!"" As all this is going on there happens to be a cat prowling around. The cat can see everything that is happening and thinks to himself, ""I want to catch that mouse! But he is too sneaky right now. That mouse is probably going for the cheese when the hunter goes for the shot, when the bear goes for the salmon, when the salmon goes for the fly. I'll pounce then."" So sure enough, the fly dips close the water, the salmon lurches and grabs the fly, the bear dives in and catches the salmon, the hunter takes the perfect shot, and the mouse darts out and grabs his cheese. Everything goes off without a hitch except for the cat. The cat falls in the river. Now whats the moral of this story?
