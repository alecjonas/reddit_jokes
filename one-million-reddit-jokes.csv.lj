""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",This horse is sitting at home one day watching MTV...,185

She screams at him, hits him sometimes, and his life becomes miserable. The problem is that he’s a Roman Catholic, and he can’t divorce her. He’s sitting in a bar one night telling his friend his problem, and his friend says ”Why don’t you have her killed?”
The guy says “I don’t know anyone who does things like that.”  His friend says, “I do. He’s in the Mafia, his name’s Artie. Let me set you up with him?” The guy agrees, and finally meeets Artie. When Artie hears his troubles, he says, “That woman is horrible, I’d kill her for free, but the mob requires that I be compensated for my work. Tell you what, I’ll do it for one dollar.” The guy agrees, tells Artie when she’ll be home alone and all the particulars. On the appointed day, Artie goes to the house, looks in the window and sees that she has a couple of friends visiting. He says, “Crap, I’ll have to kill them all.” Artie slips in through the window and ends up strangling all three of them quietly. He thinks he did a great job, but, he left some fingerprints.
The next day, the headlines of the paper says “Artie chokes three for a dollar.”

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.


The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.


The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.



Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Three guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp,2

Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race. 

On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. The Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat.

A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, the American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.

They advised that too many people were steering the boat with not enough people rowing.

To prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and one assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the one person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder.

It was called the ""Rowing Team Quality First"", program with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower.  There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses.

The next year the japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles and cancelled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next years racing team was outsourced to India.",America and Japan decide to have a canoe race.,2

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed.

Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts.

The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't
have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.",Once upon a time lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts.,3008

The white man replies, ""Look in the black man's back pocket.""",A black man and a white man walk into a bakery.,322

As he was driving home, he noticed the car had started to make strange noises, so he redirected his route to a mechanic he knew was nearby. A few blocks away from the auto shop, a car swerved out in front of him probably doing 100 mph, hopped the curb and slammed into a telephone pole. The pastor swerved to the side of the road and called 911. After that, he got out of his car and ran to the crash. 

The driver had injuries even the pastor could tell were fatal. So the pastor, being a pastor, poked his head through the window and said, “Sir, you may not survive this, so I need to ask: do you believe in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that he died for your sins so you could spend an eternity with him in Heaven?”

The man croaked, “I-I’m not sure,” and then died. 

The pastor stayed on the scene while paramedics got the man out of the car and took the body away. 

“When I got back in the car and started driving again, the noise had stopped,” the pastor concluded. “And I had a horrible thought.”

“What?” the wife asked. 

“Instead of a diagnostic, I got a died agnostic.”",A pastor comes home from his church’s evening service one night.,1

These days I need to do it myself and report only, and only if I find something unnatural. And if I find something, only things that get to touch my breasts are medical devices.""

""Strange, when I got myself checked I got the same analysis as you did when you were young.""

Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

The seven dwarfs were in the church, sitting in a rear pew, and they were arguing and giggling amongst themselves, causing quite a disturbance.

All of a sudden, Doc stands up and says, ""Father, are there any midget nuns in the church ?""

""No,"" said the priest, ""There are no midget nuns in the church.""

This seemed to settle things, bit a little time passed and the dwarfs were again whispering and giggling amongst themselves causing quite a disturbance and angering the priest.

Soon, Grumpy stands up and asks, ""Father, are there any midget nuns in the city?""

""No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the church, and there are no midget nuns in the city."" says the priest. 

Again the dwarfs resume their annoying giggling to the dismay of the curate.

Next Happy stands up and asks ""Father, are there any midget nuns in the county?""

""No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the church, there are no midget nuns in the city and there are no midget nuns in the county."" says the priest, obviously getting upset.

The dwarfs continue their interference.

Sleepy stands up and asks, ""Father, are there any midget nuns in the state?""

The priest, now somewhat angered, exclaims ""No, my son. There are no midget nuns in the church, there are no midget nuns in the city and there are no midget nuns in the county, and there are no midget nuns in the state. Now please let us continue with the ceremony.""

Bashful pops up and asks, ""But Father, surely there are midget nuns somewhere in the country?""

""No, my son. No, my son. There are no midget nuns in the church, there are no midget nuns in the city and there are no midget nuns in the county, and there are no midget nuns in the state, and there are no midget nuns in the country.""

Sneezy immediately rejoinders, ""How about the rest of North America? Surely there's at least one!""

The priest loses it. ""Devils take you, no! There are no midget nuns in the church, there are no midget nuns in the city and there are no midget nuns in the county, and there are no midget nuns in the state, and there are no midget nuns in the country. There are no midget nuns in North America. I have never heard of a midget nun. As far as I know there are no midget nuns in the entire world. Now sit down, you little bastards, and shut up so that I can finish the mass!""

Soon afterwards, a low quiet chant began to be heard from the rear of the church....

You have to break it to them gently!  Tonight when I called, you should’ve said, ‘Fluffy got up on the roof, but she is okay, we’re trying to get her down.’  Then the next day you could’ve said,  ‘Fluffy fell off the roof, but we took her to the vet and he’s doing everything he can.’  Then the *next* day, you could say,  ‘Sorry Sam, but Fluffy died.’  I could’ve handled that better!”

As any man, even though he was in a coma he didn't forget that PornHub existed. He just wanted to get off a quick wank as a celebration for getting out of the coma. 

He got at it and opened the browser, everything seemed to be going good until he clicked the link to the website. That's when instead of pop up ads... he got a message to input his credit card info to access the site. That's when it all came flooding back to him. He was ignorant about net neutrality and didn't care about what happened to the internet back in 2017 when the FCC was all the jazz around the internet.

They are telling each other stories from the time they were alive and having a great time laughing over the evil things they have done.  

As the night goes on, they get into a discussion about who might be the vilest, most evil and most universally despised human being in modern history. The discussion starts heating up and finally Hitler stands up and says, ""I murdered 6 million Jews! I started a world War that claimed millions of lives! I am so universally hated, my name AND my moustache is now taboo! Therefore I must be the vilest and most evil person in the world!"" 

Hearing that, Pol Pot speaks up and says, ""I executed the genocide of an entire country! I gathered up all the intellectuals in my country and murdered them. My country was scarred for decades as they struggled to recover from my reign. Therefore, I must be the vilest and most evil person in the world!"" 

Then George W Bush pipes up, ""You guys are full of shit. I started a modern war completely out of the thin air for oil! Terrorists from Afghanistan attacked us and I in turn attacked a completely different country! Countless American lives and Iraqi civilians were butchered in the name of a nonsense war for the greed of a few. Therefore, I must be the vilest, most evil and most universally hated person in the world! ""

They argued for hours over who of them might be the vilest, most evil and most hated person in the world. Finally exasperated, Pol pot says, ""look, to settle this once and for all, I will go to Satan and ask him who is the vilest, most evil and most universally hated person in the world. He is the devil after all, he should know"". After 10 mins, Pol Pot returns with the most confused look in his face and asks the rest,

The third man is wearing a casual sweater vest. Unlike the other two, he is clean and well-composed. His manner is cheerful, and he seems ready to burst with excitement. He practically jumps onto the stool and sits with his hands clenched, eagerly awaiting some unknown thing.

The third man looks over to the first man and asks, ""Why so glum?""

""Well,"" he sighs, ""I work at a news station in the next town over, and they just told me tomorrow's my last day.""

""That's terrible!"" the third man exclaims. ""Why would they fire you?""

""I... made some decisions in the past... I'm not proud of them,"" he continues. ""I was young and drunk and GODDAMNIT, I should've just waited for consent. She told the station just a few days ago... I'd completely forgotten about her up until now.""

The second man looks up from undoing his tie and laughs. ""HA! You think you've got it bad?!

One turns to the other and says: “You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.”

The bartender overhears this, and just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping down the bar.

The second man says: “What…… are you a nut?There is no way in hell that could happen!”

The first man says: “No, it’s true, let me prove it to you.”

He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens toward the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window, where he takes the elevator back up to the bar.

The second man tells him: “You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one-time fluke.”

The first man says: “No, it isn’t. I’ll prove it again!”

And again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window.

Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.

The second man says: “Well, what the hell, it works, I’ll try it.”

He jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, and passes the 11th……. 10th……. 9th……. and hits the sidewalk with a ‘splat.’

However, the dachshund catches a glimpse of him out of the corner of his eye. Knowing that there's no way he can win a footrace against a leopard, he decides to employ other tactics; he sits down by a nearby pile of bones. Once the leopard is in earshot, the dachshund sighs contentedly and says to himself, ""My, that was one tasty leopard."" And not being of the brightest variety, the leopard immediately high-tails it out of the area.

A monkey had been watching all this go down, and, being the cheeky rascal of the jungle, decides to spill the beans to the leopard. Swinging through the trees, he eventually catches up to the leopard, and tells him that there's no way that little dog could have eaten an entire leopard. The leopard sees he's made a fool of himself, vows revenge, and tells the monkey to hop on his back to come watch.

A few minutes later, the dachshund sees them approaching. As they get closer, he taps his foot in apparent irritation and mutters to himself,

Saul Cohen, a successful businessman and lawyer, stands and says, ""If the rabbi will stay on here, I'll personally double his salary and establish a foundation to guarantee a free college education for his children!""

More sighs and loud applause.

Estelle Rubin, age 88, stands and announces with a smile, ""If the rabbi stays, I will give him sex!"" 

There is total silence. 

The rabbi, blushing, asks her: ""Mrs. Rubin, you're a wonderful and holy lady. Whatever possessed you to say that?""

Estelle's 90-year old husband, Abe, is now trying to hide, holding his forehead with the palm of his hand and shaking his head from side to side, while his wife replies:
