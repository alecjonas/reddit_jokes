ting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.

&amp;nbsp;

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

&amp;nbsp;

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

&amp;nbsp;

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

&amp;nbsp;

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

&amp;nbsp;

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?""

&amp;nbsp;

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.

&amp;nbsp;

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

&amp;nbsp;

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?""

&amp;nbsp;

""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

&amp;nbsp;

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?""

(continued in comments)",Nate the Snake,7

He walked into the bar. He sat down once he realized he wasn't getting anywhere, a bar being in the way. He ordered the usual, as he was a regular here. And he drank that beer. He drank it so good, the other beer glasses were congratulating him on his drinking skills, and you know anyone they approve of is the real thing. Cause, you see, they are beer glasses. They have been drunk for years, they have seen it all. It takes a lot to impress one, and this guy managed it. His drinking skills were unequal.

Now, while he could certainly drink, and the glasses approved, the same could not be said of holding his alcohol. He got drunk quite easily. So while he could out-drink anyone, he has a little trouble staying conscious for it all to go down.

And therein lies the problem. He's a drunk that can't get too drunk.

Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, thereâs a large limo line at the rental office, but heâs patient and gets the job done.

Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and thereâs no punchline.

Then they explained that all patrols were busy, and that he should simply lock his door and an officer would be there when available. George said, ""Okay,"" hung up, counted to 30, and phoned the police again. ""Hello, I just called you a few seconds ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don't have to worry about them now because I've just shot them all."" Then he hung up. Within five minutes three squad cars, an Armed Response unit, and an ambulance showed up.

When I was five, my mom asked me to give 6 numbers for the lottery. â8, 13, 27, 29, 30, 31â I said. Without any hesitation, my mom punched those numbers on the lottery ticket and hoped for the best. Later that night, my whole family was watching the lottery on the television.

âThe winning numbers are 8!â The announcer said.

âFive more numbers and Iâm a millionaire!â my mom said with a big smile on her face.

â13!â The announcer continued. My dad, who believed throughout his whole life that the lottery is rigged by politicians, suddenly looked towards the television. It was as if he knew that we were going to win.

â27!â We already have half of the winning numbers. My family wasnât really that rich, so winning the lottery would be a big help.

â29!â Is it really going to happen? Are we really going to win â±80,000,000?â

â30!â One more number! The least amount we could get now is â±50,000. Getting 5 out of the 6 winning numbers is already a big achievement in itself. Even if we donât win, getting 5 winning numbers was already a testament on how lucky I was.

It was as if God heard me and answered with a big âOkayâ.

â32!â Silence filled the room. My dad slowly looked away from the television and started reading his book once again. The smile in my momâs face quickly disappeared as she stood up and went to sleep. Meanwhile, I was still very proud of my achievement. 5 out of 6 was unbelievably good. The next day, I bragged to my classmates that I had an 83.33333% guess rate. Most of my classmates were like âWhoa, thatâs amazingâ but one classmate of mine asked âThen what happened to the other 16.66666%?â

That guyâs name was Calvin. Up until high school, he was considered as the âShotgun Kingâ. He would just shotgun any major test but still end up with a 100% grade. He was one of the few people in the world that were luckier than me. At age 11, he already won the 6/55 Grand Lotto four times, and he wasnât only lucky with the lottery, he was lucky with everything. Five months ago, he won a 2017 Audi A3 Sedan. Three months ago, he won a Mercedes-Benz AMG 43, and about a week ago, he won a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. He won all these via raffle. There were a lot of doubts about his wins since not even the Philippine Air Force has an F-22.

I havenât been participating in any more raffles since my mom said that I should focus on my studies. While walking to class, I saw this flyer that said about a raffle with the 1st prize of a Samsung Refrigerator. It was the perfect time to test out my luck skills, besides, my family would extremely benefit from a new refrigerator. While I was putting my raffle entries inside the drop box, someone patted my shoulder.

âHey Kyle!â the guy said. It was Calvin.

âHey Calvin, whatâs up?â I said.

âYouâre entering the raffle too?â He asked.

âYeah man, itâs been a long time since I won something.â I answered.

âWell good luck.â He said. âIâm joining the raffle too, so the chances of you winning are slim.â

After two days, it was already raffle day. Despite what Calvin said, I was positive that I would win, so I sat in front, near where the results were going to be announced.

One by one, the results were slowly announced, starting from the 5th prize.

âThe 5th prize goes to Earl Cayanan!â

âThe 4th prize goes to Mary Ann Severino!â

âThe 3rd prize goes to John Paul Melecio!â

âThe 2nd prize goes to Harold Eugenio!â

Finally, it was the time for the 1st prize. In the corner of my eye, I suddenly saw Calvin talking to some security guards. I smell something fishy going on.

âAnd for the 1st prize, congratulations to Calvin Tolentino!â

Calvin quickly ran up the stage. I didnât believe the results so I ran up to Calvin, but on the way, two security guards stopped me. I didnât give up. I shouted: âIâm the real winner, not you! The whole raffle was rigged!â One security guard then grabbed his gun and smacked its base to my head. I passed out.

I then woke up in a hospital room with an old lady whom Iâve never met before, sitting beside me.

âSo, do you want to beat Calvin?â She asked.

âWhat do you mean?â I asked in return.

âI can make you win the next major raffle.â

âHow?â I quickly asked as I was interested.

âWell, the next raffle has a bottle made out of diamonds as its first prize. If sold, it could be as expensive as â±850,000,000.â

âOkay so how do I win it?â

âHold your horses, young boy, thatâs not the real first prize. You shouldnât win the bottle, but instead, go to the host right after the program has ended. He will give you the keys to the âWin All Raffles Robotâ or WARR for short.â

âThe what?â

âOkay, this might sound crazy but there is a robot that can make you win all raffle you enter. Itâs called the âWin All Raffles Robotâ.â

âSo how does it work?â I asked out of curiosity.

âNo one knows, it was sent by God during the 1300âs. What I do know is that whoever has the WARR would never lose a raffle. Your friend Calvin was just really lucky, but with the WARR, youâd be more than lucky.â

âBut how would I be sure that the host would give it to me?â

âWell, he is my son.â

âHow is he your son?â

âI gave birth to him.â

Since this conversation seemed like it wouldnât lead to anything useful anymore, I packed my things and left the hospital. Moments later, I saw a flyer that caught my eye.

âWin a 700-year-old Venetian Diamond Wine Bottle worth â±850,000,000. All you have to do is enter the raffle to have a chance.â

Maybe this was the raffle the old lady was talking about. I quickly went to the raffle booth and entered.

âThe raffle draw will be in an hour, sir.â The clerk said. âYou can meanwhile sit in our Waiting Area.â

Inside the Waiting Area were chairs, tables, and a television showing a replay of the 2021 NBA Finals. Itâs crazy how the Lakers won it in 6 games. Joel Embiid was such a beast for Philadelphia but they still werenât able to pull it off.

After an hour, I left the waiting room and sat in the front row near the stage where the raffle will be drawn. Slowly, people started coming and the seats started to fill up.

It was time.

The host came out of the curtains and picked one raffle ticket in the spinning jar.

âThe 5th prize which is a 1942 Zero Japanese fighter plane, goes to Erika Sanchez!â

âThe 4th prize, which is an authentic piece of the Shroud of Turin, goes to Francois LeBourgeoisie!â I canât believe the host mispronounced his name.

âThe 3rd prize, which is the original copy of the Indian epic, the Ramayana, goes to Juan Tiu-Tres.â

âThe 2nd prize, which is a legitimate metal shard from the 1947 Roswell UFO Crash goes to Zack Dimagiba.

âAnd finally, the event youâve all been waiting for, the 1st prize which is a 700-year-old Venetian Diamond Wine Bottle goes toâ¦Calvin Tolentino!â

âWhat?!â I shouted as I jumped off my seat.

Someone then suddenly patted my back. It was Calvin.

âItâs okay Kyle, youâll get your chance.â Calvin said.

I was about to punch him in the face but I suddenly remembered that I never really intended to win the 1st prize, so before Calvin went to the stage to claim his prize, I told him: âHey Calvin!â

âYes Kyle?â He said with an intimidating smile to his face.

I moved closer to him, stared him in the eye, and softly said: âYou may have won the bottle, but you havenât won the WARR.â

He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.

An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him.

 The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, âWhat kind of car ya got there, sonny?â

The doctor replies, âA Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!â

âThatâs a lot of money,â says the old man. âWhy does it cost so much?â

âBecause this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!â states the doctor proudly.

The moped driver asks, âMind if I take a look inside?â

âNo problem,â replies the doctor.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.

Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, âThatâs a pretty nice car, all right, but Iâll stick with my moped!â

Just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do. 

He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph.

Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror â what it could beâ¦and suddenlyâ¦

WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH!

Something whips by him going much faster!

âWhat on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?â the doctor asks himself.

He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 175 mph.

Then, up ahead of him, he sees that itâs the old man on the moped!

Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph.

WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH!

Heâs feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN!

Astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 250 mph.

Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

The Ferrari is flat out, and thereâs nothing he can do!

Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

The doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive.

He runs up to the mangled old man and says, âOh my gosh! Is there anything I can do for you?â

The old man whispers, âUnhook my suspenders from your side mirror.â","A doctor goes out and buys the best car on the market, a brand new Ferrari GTOâ¦",22313

""Now remember....that's all original leather. You can't let it get too wet. If it starts raining and you don't have anywhere to shelter it, make sure you keep a tub of vaseline with you. Rub it all over the seat so the water will just bead off.""

The guy takes his new bike and goes to pick up his girlfriend. The girlfriend invites the guy over to her parents house for dinner. This will be the first time he's ever eaten with her family.

""I should let you know the rule of the table"" she said. ""There is no talking allowed. The first person to talk at the table has to clean the dishes.""

The guy doesn't think this is that big of a deal until he arrives at the family's house and looks in the kitchen. There must be at least three months worth of dishes inside. They are stacked up to the ceiling, stinking and rotting of mold and old bits of food everywhere. The guy almost throws up at the smell and sight of such a disgusting state of affairs.

Dinner begins, and no one is saying a word. The tension is starting to get to the boyfriend, so he concocts a plan to make someone else speak first.

The guy drops his fork, goes over to his girlfriend at the table, throws her up on top and just starts fucking her in front of everyone. The father and mother are obviously mortified. But even with their jaws on the floor, no one says a word.

The guy stops and thinks to himself ""This is going to be harder than I thought...."" then he gets another idea.....

Without hesitation, he runs over to the mother throws her up on the table and fucks the shit out of her, right in front of the father.

The dad is staring daggers through the boyfriend and turning bright red in anger. But still says nothing. The girlfriend is becoming teary eyed and covering her mouth with her hands, but doesn't make a peep.

The boyfriend stops fucking the mother and sits back down at his seat, completely flustered. He takes a gander out the window, and notices a sudden heavy rain has settled in. He then realizes that his vintage motorbike is parked on the street, uncovered.

The boyfriend pops out of his seat and grabs his tub of vaseline.
The dad jumps out of his chair and yells out, ""ALRIGHT, I'LL DO THE GODDAMNED DISHES!""

This goes on for 2 years until one winter morning, while on his morning run, he slips on the muddy ground and lands right next to a genie's lamp.

The man rubs it, and low and behold a genie posp out and says ""Hey, man. Nobody's found me for a while, and I'm feeling generous this morning. I'm gonna grant you 4 wishes. However, you cannot wish harm on anyone, you cannot wish for money, and you cannot wish for more wishes. Wishing for any of these things will undo all of your wishes, and disqualify any wishes you are yet to make. Deal?"" The man thinks for a bit and says ""Deal.""

""So, what is your first wish?"" The genie asks. ""Well, I have an issue with erectile dysfunction. Could you please fix it for me?"" The genie, being a pedantic little asshole replies ""I *could*, but you didn't wish so I won't.""

""Oh, alright,"" grumbles the man. ""I wish that I no longer had erectile dysfunction."" Almost immediately, a boner forms. ""Here's how it works: If you want it to become firm, it will do so instantly, but you have to wait 20 miutes for it to die down again. So, what is your next wish?"" The man thinks for a bit, and decides to take the genie home for later use. The genie replies ""Wise choice."" and heads back inside the lamp.

When the man gets home, he hops in the shower, and proudly shows his wife the lamp and his boner. He explains how his ""new"" penis works and proudly demonstrates. That night, in bed, no sooner has he erected than he ejaculates violently, covering his wife in semen. They take a shower, clearly unhappy with the genie's idiotic way of granting wishes when the man says ""I wish that genie would just go away.""

Suddenly, a loud pop is heard from the living room. The man and his wife look at each other, and then the man gets out of the shower, dries off and sprints to the drawer set, where the genie's lamp is missing. The man starts panicking and looks all around the house, and runs outside stark naked. An officer who is passing by turns on his lights and arrests him. The man explains about the genie, and the officer decides to make him take an alcohol test.

The man had a few bottles of beer with dinner, so he fails and the cop takes him down to the station. Later that evening, he wishes that he was still home. Suddenly, he finds himself in bed with his wife who jumps and looks at him. ""Whare have you been!?!?"" she asked. ""In jail. I failed a brethaliser test."" ""I told you not to drink too much beer."" she retorted. ""Look, honey, I'm back now. I wished that I was back home with you and hey! I'm back! That must mean that the genie will grant wishes no matter where it is in relation to you!""

""But honey,"" she replied, ""You used up your wishes! Don't they grant 3 wishes only?"" ""No. This one granted me 4. I still have one wish!"" ""OK. Wish for a baby."" ""NO! He's exceedingly literal. If I wish for a baby, then some random child will pop into existance. I wan't *our* child."" ""So wish for all problems with your penis to go away."" ""Hey! That's a good idea! Nice work!"" ""Than - "" ""OK. I wish that my penis had no medical conditions and was completely free of issues."" Suddenly, he got an erection and fucked his wife, right there, right then. 9 months later to the hour, their son was born.

The inspector comes across one stand and observes for a few minutes the vendor's interaction with customers. 

One customer asks ""I'll have one hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut."" The vendor replies ""coming right up!""

What happens next shocks the inspector. The vendor, without gloves, picks up the hot dog and bun, smears the mustard on with his finger and flings on the sauerkraut barehanded. 

Then, between customers the inspector notices him going to the bathroom right under the stand, still without gloves or washing his hands. The inspector runs over before any more customers.

""You can't serve customers like this! Absolutely disgusting! You never put on gloves and went to the bathroom right here! You got one week buddy and I'll be back, if it happens again you'll be closing up shop. Next time I come by you have to use tongs!""

The next week the inspector returns and sees the vendor has cleaned up his act. The cart is spotless, and he is using tongs this time and gloves as the inspector demanded. The inspector is more than happy and thrilled to pass this vendor's health inspection. 

Before the inspector leaves, he says ""There's just one question I have left...I noticed you didn't leave for the bathroom. What are you doing about that?""

I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. I think deep down I just did not want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to finally check on her.

Around midnight, I hid in the garage behind my golf clubs so I could get a good view of the whole street when she arrived home from a night out with 'the girls. '

When she got out of the car she was buttoning up her blouse, which was open, and she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on.

It was at that moment, crouching behind my golf clubs, that I noticedÂ a hairline crack where the grip meets the graphite shaft on my 3-wood.

Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the pro-shop where I bought it?

He struggles again to ask, ""Nurse, Are my testicles black?""

Again the nurse replies, ""I can''t tell. I''m only here to wash your face and hands.""

The ward nurse passes by and sees the man getting a little distraught so she marches over to inquire what is wrong.

""Nurse,"" he mumbles, ""Are my testicles black?""

Being a nurse she thinks ""I've seen worse"" and is therefore undaunted. 

She whips back the bedclothes, pulls down his pajama trousers, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas, replaces the bedclothes and announces, ""Nothing is wrong with them.""

At the fourth house, a blonde lady answered.
She was wearing silk pajamas, and was motioning him to follow her

they were done, he went downstairs. On the table was a huge

The mailman was curious, so he said to the lady, ""I've had the best

The lady replied, ""I asked my husband what we should do for you and

So when the Church decided to do some deferred maintenance, Jock was able to put in the low bid, and got the job. As always, he thinned his paint way down with turpentine.

One day while he was up on the scaffolding -- the job almost finished -- he heard a horrendous clap of thunder, and the sky opened.

The downpour washed the thinned paint off the church and knocked Jock off his scaffold and onto the lawn among the gravestones and puddles of thinned and worthless paint.

Jock knew this was a warning from the Almighty, so he got on his knees and cried: âOh, God! Forgive me! What should I do?â

And from the thunder, a mighty voice: âREPAINT! REPAINT! AND THIN NO MORE!â",The religious painter,956

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.


In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.


He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.


The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.


The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.


After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.


The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.


This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.


Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.


The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.


The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 


To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.


The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.


In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.


-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''

-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.

-''Swear''

-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''

So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 


Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.


When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",The Boss and The Client,26

And when I was very small he told me about this little restaurant that served THE best Bavarian cream pie. Apparently he went there every opportunity he had. He couldn't get enough of that Bavarian cream pie - it was absolutely unreal.

Well, a few years ago, my grandpa found out that he had a terminal illness, and only had a few months left to live. So, he booked a deluxe vacation cruise to Europe that would eventually take him to that little town in Germany with the famous Bavarian cream pie.

A few weeks into the cruise, the ship started slowly sinking off of the coast of Portugal. I don't know if you remember that, but it was all over the news at the time. Well the life raft that my grandpa was in also turned out to be slowly leaking. So he helped all of the people that were in his life raft onto another one, but he wouldn't get on himself because it was already so overloaded. So, my grandpa, and I'm not making this up. This was in the news. My grandpa, at 84 years old, swims for over a mile in the Atlantic Ocean to the coast of Portugal.
Water-logged and exhausted, he hitches a ride and gets dropped off about 100 miles outside his destination in Germany. Trying to cross a main highway, he gets clipped by the side mirror of a car, but not badly, and he manages to hitch another ride with some people headed for Germany.

Eventually he catches a bus and arrives in this little town in Germany that he remembered from his youth. He's thrilled to find the old restaurant that he'd loved so much 60 years ago, and he walks in and takes his usual seat at the table by the window. The waitress comes over and my grandpa says, (my grandpa spoke German fluently, by the way), he says, ""I know exactly what I want. You have no idea what I've had to go through to get here. I would love a nice big slice of your wonderful Bavarian cream pie.""
The waitress says, ""Sorry, Sir - but we're all out of Bavarian cream.""
My grandpa says, ""Apple's fine.""",This [long] joke always cracked me up..,8

 One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They'd have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to lay down its arms. The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler dogs in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, killed his siblings, and gave him all the milk. The used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it.
 ""When the day came for the fight, the Americans showed up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog.
 ""When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out and wrapped itself around the outside of the ring. It had the Russian dog almost completely surrounded. When the Russian dog leaned over to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund leaned up and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog.
 The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. `We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler dogs in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.""

His buddy remembers it's been raining that day and says ""check this out, here's what you do. Walk up to the next beautiful woman you see and say 'tickle your ass with a feather.'"" The friend looks at him crazy.

""No, no, it's cool. Some chicks are into that kinky crap. If she's showing that she's not? Just tell her 'it's particularly nasty weather' and she'll think she misheard you.""

With reluctance the guy decides to give it a shot. With his buddy watching from a distance, he walks to the bar and approaches the most beautiful woman in the club and taps her on the shoulder. Without skipping a beat he says,

""Shove a feather up your ass.""

He worked in a famous hotel in town, called 69. In all the years he has worked there, he has never experienced any strange occurences, until one day, when a strange man came to town.

He was dressed impeccably from head to toe, and one could tell from a glance that he was wealthy. He came in and booked a room, and asked specifically for room 069. The peculiar thing was when he special-ordered a list of things from the manager, (3 chicken eggs, a 20-feet whip, and a pet turtle) and promised to tip him handsomely. After receiving his items, the man locked himself in his room and didn't come out until he had to check out. Then the man left and Dave thought nothing of it.

The next year, on the same day, the man came to the hotel again and ordered the same things as the year before. Dave instantly recognized him, for he was the only one who would order such peculiar things. The man locked himself in his room once more, and didn't show himself until he had to check out. Dave was now very curious as to what this man was doing in his room. 

The next year, on the same day, the man came back again and ordered the same things. This time when he was about to check out, Dave asked him about his strange behaviour.

Dave : I'm sorry to pry, but i'm dying to know what you do in that room with those items every year.

Man : I could tell you, but it's really embarrassing, so you have to promise not to tell anyone else.

And so, Dave promised the man, and finally learned the man's secret.

Unfortunately, Dave is a very honest man, and has kept his promise till this day so I do not know the secret as well. If he ever breaks his promise i will let you guys know. Thank you for reading ð

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.  After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise from the man's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.  
In the morning, when the man handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.  
He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.  
The man paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.  The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

He's new in town, since the barkeeper knows everyone else there. The man sits down at a small table. The barkeeper approaches him and asks what he wants to order. He says ""I'll have three beers please."" The barkeeper says that he could bring them one after another but the man insists on having three beers at once.


So the barkeeper brings him three beers at once, the man finishes, leaves, comes back the next week and does the same. This goes on for a few weeks until the barkeeper finally asks him why he orders three beers at once. The man says: ""You see, I have two best friends. We always got together this day of the week to have three beers together. Recently we each had to leave to different cities. We made a pakt that we would still have those beers, one for everyone, at the same time in a different city.""


The barkeeper was moved by this, since he now knows that man's motivation, which is absolutely great.


One week the man comes in and sits down at his table. The barkeeper approaches and asks ""The usual?"" The man replies ""No, just two beers please"". The barkeeper is confused and gets the beers. He's thinking about this change and comes to the conclusion that one of the man's friends must have passed away.


So he brings the beers to the man, puts his hand on his shoulder and says ""I'm sorry for your friend, mate."" The man says ""What, why?"". The barkeeper is confused and starts explaining that he thought one of his friends must have passed away, since the man only ordered two drinks.


The man replies: ""Oh, what, no, not at all, I just stopped drinking.""",Three beers,82

""But there MUST be some Mexican Jews, are you sure?"" ""Si, SeÃ±or. There is no Mexican Jews."" ""I don't believe it. Is there anyone else you can ask to be sure?""

Knowing that he will get no peace from these two gringos unless he goes through the motions, the server responds, ""SeÃ±or I will ask the cook, he will know."" While he is gone the two friends continue to discuss the likelihood of there being Jews in Mexico, going so far as to place bets on the outcome.

Seeing the server approaching they ask him eagerly, ""Well what did he say? Are there Mexican Jews?"" ""I'm sorry SeÃ±or. We have orange jews, apple jews, and tomato jews, but he say we no have any Mexican jews.""

I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""

Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.

The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.

""No!"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.

""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump. 

The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

""I told you to stay away from my daughter! But I don't want to kill ya. I'll tell you what, if you want me to let you go, go out into my fields and pick one fruit then bring it back to me.""

So the three guys hurried out into the fields and began to look for fruit. 

The first guy returned quickly with a single grape.

The farmer held he Gun to the guy's face. ""Now shove it up your ass and keep it there.""

Quite easily he popped the grape in his asshole.

The second guy arrived with an apple.

The farmer held his gun up. ""Up your as and keep it there!""

The second guy crammed the apple up his ass after a long five minutes and limped over to the first guy.

The guy with the apple in his ass began to laugh.

""What's so funny?"" The first guys said. ""You have an apple in your ass!""

""I do."" The second guy said. ""But there's frank walking over with a watermelon!""",Three guys had to spend the night in a farmers barn...,4

Mummy snail and baby snail reply back ""we wont we promise, we will wait for you, you can trust us""

Its been a few days now and baby snail says ""oh mummy im feeling a little hungry""  
mummy snail replies ""it wont be long dear daddy with return soon and we can enjoy our lunch""  
""Okay mummy im very excited for it""  

Its just over a week and mummy and baby snail are looking uncomfortable, mummy snail says ""it wont be long now dear, we will eat soon""  

Its 3 weeks at this point and both mummy and baby snail are licking their snaily lips salivating thinking of those sweet lettuce sandwiches sat next to them in the basket ""Mummy can we not just have one to hold us off?""  
""No No dear we promised daddy it wont be long now, just look at the road and keep an eye out for him""

Its 8 weeks and mummy and baby are really agitated, they both know daddy should be back by now, baby snail asks again ""please mummy can we not just nibble on one im ever so hungry""  
""no dear we promised daddy we wont eat any of them, just hold on, it wont be long now"" so they go back to waiting and wasting away  

Its been 12 weeks and baby snail is perishing and mummy snail is struggling too she says ""we can just nibble one between us daddy won...."" as shes finishing her sentence grabbing for the sandwich a rustling in the bushes happens...  

""AH HA!"" Shouts daddy snail as he jumps out of the bushes ""I knew i couldnt trust you! so im not going!""",A family of snails go to the park for lunch,13

""Excuse me? You can't just take what's mine! Hand it over, right now!"" The hunter is clearly angry. The farmer's grin getting bigger.

""Alright alright"", the farmer says calmingly. ""Let's settle this with a simple game we use around here to resolve an argument. The winner will keep the goose. The rules are simple. I'll kick you in the nuts and see how much time it takes you to recover. Then you'll do the same to me. Whoever recovers faster is the winner.""

The hunter, provoked and angry, agrees immediately.

The two get ready, the farmer kicks first. He takes a full swing and hits the farmer right between the legs. The hunter nearly blacks out; a moment passes before he screams in agonising pain, holding his crotch. His knees give in and he falls face first onto the ground. Time passes and the hunter does his best to endure the pain and get back up.

Eventually, still in pain, the hunter gets back onto his feet. With teary eyes and a sore throat he says: ""Now it's my turn!""

The farmer, looks at him smiling, shakes his head and goes: 
""nah, man. It's fine, you can have it. Here's the goose, I didn't want it anyway"", and walks off, laughing out loud.

My friends and I went to England, thinking it would be fun to try our best to fit in to a culture other than the Midwestern U.S..  Of course, having nothing but stereotypes to go on, we foolishly planned in our hotel.

""Okay, you guys aren't my friends,"" I said to them. ""You're my mates.""

They nodded agreement, and we headed out to look for some fish-and-chips, because that seemed like the thing to do. As soon as we got to the nearest fish-and-chips dispensary, we were pleased to see that there was already a clump of people in an orderly, single-file arrangement.  ""Queueing is the national pastime of the UK,"" I whispered to my m8s.

We got into the back and I couldn't help but overhear the people in front of us - truly, a group of complete assholes, or wankers,  as some might call them, but I just kept thinking of them as dicks - talking loudly and obnoxiously over their business plans.

""We'll grab people from their homes and force them to work for us without pay, to maximize profits!"" one of them said to another.  I was disgusted, of course, but when I looked at my fellow Americans, they were nodding in thoughtful agreement - this was too much for me.

""Really, guys!?"" I said to my boys.  ""This is fucking ludicrous!""

post,6pj76x,2qh72,jokes,false,1501016482,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6pj76x/my_stepson/,self.jokes,,"A couple of years ago I was in a relationship with a girl with a son. She had had this kid with a previous partner. Now this partner was a really abusive guy, he used to beat her up, both emotionally and physically. He sent her to hospital on a couple of occasions, and on the most brutal of his rages he pushed her down the stairs. She suffered severe head trauma and the doctors said that she was within an inch of her life. Her kid, though, was just the sweetest. He was kind in every manner possible; incredibly polite, generous and just a real pleasure to be around. 

After a couple of years of being together, and seeing her little boy grow up (he was 12 at this point), we decided to get married and move in to a house, along with her son of course. When I was clearing out her old apartment I found a box of her ex partner's belongings. I left it downstairs, and upon returning from work I found the box opened, with nothing removed apart from a pair of blue trousers. I questioned my wife about it but she had no idea where the garments could have been. I went to my step son's room and found that he had them on his bed. I asked him why he took them out and he told me that he really liked them and wanted to keep them. Who was I to say he couldn't keep a pair of his biological father's trousers!? 

The next day, when I got home from work I found that my stepson was wearing them, and had cut them from the knees down. 'Fair enough', I thought, it's just boys being boys. 

Unfortunately though, his attitude really started to deteriorate from here. He lost all his good manners, all his generosity, and started getting in fights at school. This carried on for several months, he was getting detentions, he was suspended and the violent attitude did not dissipate. All the while he remained inseparable from his dad's cutoff trousers, wearing them everyday. Refusing to take them off. 

Fast forward a month, I'm coming home from the shops and I find my poor wife at the bottom of the stairs, her head badly bleeding and her bones broken. I was in a state of absolute shock! I looked around and to my horror I see her son - my stepson - at the top of the stairs, just laughing. It was so obvious he'd pushed her while she was descending. 

An ambulance rushed her to hospital and I went with them. I waited patiently, hoping with all of my might that she's going to be okay. I'd left the boy at home with the police that came for questioning. Eventually the doctor came to me and asked me to come to his office. There was another police officer present too. My face must have looked shocked. ""It's okay, your wife is going to make a full recovery. She's just regained consciousness"" the doctor said, calming me. 

The policeman explained to me that they didn't blame me at all, it was clear that my stepson had done the awful thing to his mother. He warned me though that their main goal now was to calm him down and get him out of his father's trouser cutoffs and into a new outfit entirely. 

""How does that matter? Why was he so violent to his mother?!"" I exclaimed. 

""Ah well it's obvious, isn't it?"" The officer replied. ""The boy has half his dad's jeans.""",My stepson,6

âPet fish?!â the warden replied.


âYes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home.â


âThatâs a bunch of crap! Fish canât do that!â replied the warden in disbelief.


The man looked at the game warden for a moment and then said, âHere, Iâll show you. It really works.â


âO.K. Iâve GOT to see this!â The game warden was curious.


The man poured the fish into the river and stood and waitedâ¦


After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, âWell?â


âWell, what?â the man responded.


âWhen are you going to call them back?â the game warden prompted.

When he reaches the pearly gates, St. Peter welcomes him inside and shows him around. There was everything there that could make a zebra happy for eternity. Lush green grass, crystal clear waters, rolling pastures as far as the eye could see, and plenty of lady zebras too! 

At the end of the tour St. Peter noticed that the zebra looked troubled. St. Peter asked the zebra what was troubling him? The zebra said to St. Peter, ""All my life I have been troubled by a single question. Now that I have died I don't want to go through eternity without an answer. Being a zebra it is hard to tell, but am I a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes?"" 

St. Peter thought for a moment and told the zebra, ""It would be best for you to ask God. After all, he made you.""

So, that is exactly what the zebra did. He went to God and asked, ""God. This place is amazing and is more beautiful than any place on earth, but I am troubled. All my life I have wanted to know, am I a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes?""

God replies, ""You are what you are!""

The zebra politely thanked God and walked away.

The zebra of course was not satisfied with Gods answer and was confused. He went weeks thinking it over and eventually he went back to God. 

""God, I know you have already answered this question once, but I must have an answer I can understand. It is completely consuming my thoughts and I dont want to spend eternity thinking about this. Am I a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes?""

God replied, ""You are what you are.""

Again, the zebra walks away. This time though he is angry. Why would God deny him peace of mind? He storms up to St. Peter and tells him that God was no help with his question and now he would have to go through eternity in turmoil without an answer. 

St. Peter was truly concerned for the zebra and asked, ""What did God say?""

So the zebra told him ""All he kept saying is, You are what you are.""

St. Peter looked at the zebra and says, ""Well...there is your answer! You are a white zebra with black stripes! 

Now the zebra was very confused. ""How do you figure?""

St. Peter explained, ""If you were a black zebra with white stripes he would have said, You is what you is.""

Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"". 

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos. 

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time. 

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist list the others.""

""It almost looks like he's waving,"" said the second Alien. 

""Let me see,"" said the third Alien. ""Wow! I don't believe it."" 

""What?"" Asked the second Alien.

There is a knock and I answer the door where I'm greeted with,  ""Hello sir, my name is Lance, and I've come to take Nance to the dance."" I think this sounds a little weird then realized what he said rhymed. He looks ok so I send Nancy off for her date.

A few minutes later I recognize the next kid as I know his family. He says, ""Hi I'm Rick and I want to take Nick on a picnic."" I'll be honest, I laughed a little at what he said but I happily send them on their way. Rick is a great kid.

Some time later I hear an impatience knock at the door. Then the door bell rings a few times and this scruffy looking kid is standing there. My daughter tries to intercept our meeting but I hold my ground at the front door. He doesn't want to make eye contact and I'm not impressed. He mumbles his name and I say, ""Speak up son, I cannot hear you.""

He lifts his head a little and says, ""I'm Chuck....""
