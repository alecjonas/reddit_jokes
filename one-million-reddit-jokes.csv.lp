Unfortunately, the wife only has soup at home. No main course or dessert or anything. Just plain old chicken noodle soup. So she has a plan. 

The wife tells her son, ""Listen, I'm gonna go invite the guest and your father to the table for dinner. Then I'm gonna call out your name to tell you to bring out the meal. When I do, you're gonna make it seem like we had food but you dropped it all save for the soup. Just shout 'Mom, I accidentally dropped...' and then say any dish you want.

The son agrees, excited to be part of the plan. So the wife goes to invite her husband and the guest to the dinner table.

""Son, bring out the meal,"" she called.

But it was payday, so instead of going home, he stayed out the entire weekend partying with his mates and spending his entire wages.

When he finally appeared at home on Sunday night, he was confronted by his angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions. Finally his wife stopped the nagging and said to him, ""How would you like it if you didn't see me for two or three days?""

He replied, ""That would be fine with me.""

Monday went by and he didn't see his wife.

Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same results.

But on Thursday, the swelling went down just enough where he could see her a little out of the corner of his left eye.

""Ma'am, this is a lovely establishment, so I fear I may have wasted your time entering it. You see, I've come to procure your services, but I'm afraid all I have is $15.""  
""Not to worry,"" says the mistress, ""we have a girl in the back that's only $10! Her names Sal, but everyone just calls her Sandpaper Sally.""  
Taken aback by such a cruel monicker, and the inherent disgusting nature it implies, the man second guesses himself. But, being so destitute for intimacy, he agrees and pays the mistress. He's in back only 5 minutes before the mistress and the other girls hear him come dashing through the hall, wailing in pain and holding his bloody crotch. The man flees into the night and the mistress only laughs as she counts the days money and expects to never see him again.  
But the following week, to her surprise, the man returns. He looks at her with utter defeat and practically whispers, ""Ma'am, I find myself even worse for wear at our current meeting. I need your cheapest woman.""  
The mistress points to the back and the man hands her a crumpled tenner. As is on cue, the man again comes running out from the back. Holding his parts and screeching a string of sailors curses. This time, the madame is SURE she'll never see the man again.  
But the next night, right before she was about the lock the door, the man saunters up to her and rests his arm slyly on her counter. The stink of liquor drowns her as he slams a crisp 10 in front of her and swaggers to the back.  
The time passes slowly for the impatient madame. 5 minutes. 30. An hour. The sultry sounds of sweet and tender lovemaking fill the brothel and after two hours the man walks out slowly, a cigarette in hand and a mile wide grin adorning his face. The madame thinks she's never seen a customer so satisfied in her establishment and has to ask,  
""Sir, no one's ever come out of that room looking anything but pained. How can you be so collected after visiting Sandpaper Sally?""  
The man smiles gayly and leans in to say,  
""Once you peel the scabs back, she's the smoothest ride you'll ever take!""",Sandpaper Sally,0

The man sank down in his seat, blushed and sheepishly uttered, “Yes.”

The woman said, “Then you have to get off.”

Roger, realising that the airline had over-booked and he had to give up his perk seat, put his hand up and said, “I'm Gay,” and started to get up.

Immediately another passenger stands up and miltantly calls out, “I'm gay too! They can't chuck us all off.”","Working on an airline, you receive free or reduced-priced flights.",44

The fairy tells the brother that she'll return his donkey alive , but on one condition. Being in the woods, she hardly got any sex for the last hundred years and he has to fuck her a total of 10 times. Now the brother gets really excited. He unzips his pants and starts fucking her.

I bet Lou Reed’s wife couldn’t believe it when he broke the news to her that they were going to do this concert. I mean, she mastiff had to pinch-‘er self.

“Concert for dogs now Lou? I know you’re avant-garde but what’s the pointer that?”

But Lou Reed soon set-'er straight. He said “Sch-nau-zer’s a time and a place for complaining; this is a great opportunity for us dear. I terrier, we can’t basset up! I’ll put a band together and whippet into shape.”

“Okay” she said, “But make sure it’s a cosmopolitan band. Get an English guy on drums and someone from Tehran on rhythm guitars…”

“Hang on love, I’ll just write that down: Pom, Iranian. Anyone else?”

“Yup. For backing vocals get the lead singer from that influential synth-pop band Kraftwerk. And, er, maybe the famous American actress and occasional singer who starred in Moonlighting.”

“Okay, German, Shepard.”

“And on drums…”

“Hang on” interrupted Lou Reed, “Dachshund-ough.”

The preparations then began and they started to pack their bags. Lou said “Oh no, I can’t find that lovely knitted sweater I bought when I did that gig in Dublin.”

Laurie, his wife, soon located it, “here it is Lou, Irish-wool-found. By the way, did you find our annoying neighbour's skillet that you borrowed?”

“Fucking Carl’s-pan.-Yeah-I’ll take it ‘round later.”

“Make sure him or his misses is there when you give it back, Dal-make-sure-no one’ll say we’ve still got it.”

Soon Laurie was ready to go, “H-Okay,-do-you mind if I tell my friend? You know the lady from number 35, who you really don’t like.”

“What, shit-Sue?”

“I wish you wouldn’t call her that dear. It’s very rude. And anyway, why don’t you like her?”

“Well, ‘cause she talks rot-while-her huge husband scares me. I mean he’s a big-old bastard. Last time I told her about one of my gigs she just talked about it endlessly at work; she really bored-her-colleagues.”

They climbed into their car to go to the airport to Australia.

“Wow” said Laurie “I’ve had such a great day ‘n’-it’s-only still lunchtime.

“Hang on” said Lou suddenly, “we better do some publicity for this gig. Can I borrow 20 bucks for some posters for it?”

“Sure-pay-me back next week” replied his wife, “and get me a box of chocolates to say thanks. My purse is on the backseat, I’ll just reach-back and get it.""

“Have you told any of your old music buddies about it? Has-Keith Richards called?”

“No” said Lou, “but I told ex-Velvet’s drummer Maureen Tucker all about it. I really talked it up.”

“Did-you-wow-‘er?”

“I sure did wow her; She was well impressed” said Lou. “I’m so excited about this gig. If it goes well, I want to take this show to dogs all around the world.”

“Well let’s just see how it goes first, love” cautioned his wife, “Don’t start thinking about an elaborate-tour.”

“Not yet, it’s going to be a logistical challenge anyway. I mean, for a start, won’t they have to clean the auditorium – not after a crowd of dogs has poo-ed all over it.”

“And, if any promoter asked you to do a gig for cats, I would be hesitant. I’ll-say-shun that offer.”

Suddenly, Lou slammed on the breaks. “Cripes, that Indian chef just spilt a load of melted butter on the road. That was close. Caw-ghee! This-a last thing I wanted to see.”

As they pulled into the airport, they drove past a textile maker who’d fallen into the icy Hudson River and just climbed out.

“Look darling,” said Lou Reed, “it’s a cold-and-wet-weaver.”

On the way he happens to pass a brothel with a sign outside that reads ""Helana. Sings Opera while giving a blowjob.""

Now the guy is not normally one to visit a brothel but being an opera lover, curiosity gets the better of him. ""How the hell can she sing opera while giving a blowjob?!?"". So he goes in...

He's greeted by the receptionist and he asks for Helena. ""Oh very good choice sir! It's $100 for 30 minutes. You will not be disappointed. Oh and one VERY IMPORTANT thing: Helena likes to work in the dark. DO NOT turn the light on."". Slightly puzzled the guy agrees and is shown to Helana's room.

He enters and all is pitch dark. ""Undress"" a seductive female voice commands and soon they guy is enjoying the most sensational blowjob he's ever had. Suddenly, while the blowjob is still in progress, she begins to sing what the guy realizes can only be the first aria from Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"". The voice is perfect. Not a single choke or gag despite the blowjob. The guy proceeds to blow his load in sheer amazement. ""Now go. And DO NOT turn the light on as you leave"" she orders him. In a state of shock and awe the guy leaves quietly as instructed.

Next day at work all he can think about is Helena and the blowjob. ""How on earth could she sing so beautifully with my penis in her mouth?"". Again curiosity beats him so he takes the long way home that takes him past the brothel...

""Welcome back sir!"" the receptionist greets. ""Will it be Helena again sir?"". The guy nods. ""Very good sir. Oh but don't forget. No lights please sir.""

Soon the guy is in Helana's room again, in complete darkness, receiving a spectacular blowjob. And again Helena breaks out into opera, this time in Italian. The guy realizes it's ""Una voce poco"" - the first aria from Rossini's ""Barber of Seville"". Beauty and perfection all at once. Completely stunned, the guy empties his balls with a loud groan into Helena's waiting orifice. ""You may go now"" commands Helena ""And remember NO LIGHTS!"". The guy obeys meekly.

Next day the guy can barely concentrate at work, tormented by the mystery of Helena. ""How can she sing like that _and_ suck on my junk. I _have_ to know.""

That evening the guy again visits the brothel. ""Welcome back sir! An honor to see you back so soon. Will it be Helena once more?"" the receptionist asks. The guy nods. ""She does have this effect on people sir. Of course I don't need to remind you of the rules sir. No lights allowed"".

Determined the guy marches to the room and enters boldly. Again pitch darkness. He undresses and soon Helena is giving him a blowjob to die for. Moments later, in the sweetest voice he's ever heard, she begins to sing ""Un bel di vedremo"" from ""Madame Butterfly"". Deeply moved, the guy is surprised to find tears streaming down his face as his hot jizz explodes into Helena. ""Leave me now. And DO NOT turn on the lights as you go.""

The guy proceeds to dress, undecided after such an amazing experience if he should break the rules. ""...but I MUST know..."" he thinks.

Determined, in one swift move the guy flicks on the light switch and spins round to look at the room. He sees a beautiful woman lying naked on a bed, eyes closed. Next to her on a silk pillow he sees a glass eye.","""Helana. Sings Opera while giving a blowjob."" [long]",49

A medic thinks that he can outsmart the bartender wants the $50, so he goes to the clinic.

The medic tells the bartender he had lost his sense of taste, to which the bartender replies: 
""Here, have some of this medicine."" and hands him a blue bottle with a big white sticker plastered on the side from the top of the shelf. The medic gulps down the contents of the bottle and says: ""This isn't medicine, this is whiskey!"" The bartender grinning ear to ear, says: ""Congratulations! You've got your taste back. That will be $20.""

The medic is a bit pissed and goes back after a few days. He walks up to the bartender and says, ""Sir, I have lost my memory, I cannot recall anything."" The bartender hands him a blue bottle with a big white sticker plastered on the side from the top of the shelf and asks him to drink it. The medic looks at the bartender and says, ""but that's whiskey!"" The bartender with the same wide smile says, ""Congratulations! You've got your memory back. That will be $20.""

The medic leaves angrily and comes back after several days, more determined than ever to finally outsmart the bartender.

The medic walks up to the bartender and says, ""I have lost my vision and cannot see things clearly."" The bartender furrowed his brows and said, ""I'm very sorry sir but I don't think I can help you with that."" The medic takes a leap of joy and sticks his hand out, asking for his hard earned $50. The bartender puts a bill in his palm.

""But that's a 1 dollar bill!""

""Congratulations, you have gotten your vision back! That will be $20 sir.""

Every morning after breakfast, her mother sets her up on the window sill, looking out over the front yard at the goings on of the neighborhood.

Every day, Sarah begs and pleads with her parents to be enrolled in school with the other children. Again and again, Sarah’s parents deny her requests, but eventually, her perseverance pays off. Sarah’s mother finally contacts the school to have Sarah to enrolled.

The very next morning after breakfast, Sarah’s mother packs a bag lunch and a backpack full of school supplies, and takes Sarah out to the curb to meet the bus. The bus driver, hurrying as always, pulls in next to the curb, squashing poor Sarah.

Out on their first mission, they are trekking through some mountains when they realise that they are surrounded by a tribe of unknown origin. 

The chieftain surprises them all by speaking english. He gives the two scholars a choice of two fates: death or mumbutu. The first scholar answers the chieftain, reasoning that anything was better than death, he says, ""I choose mumbutu!"" 

The tribe all jump up and down, cheering ""MUMBUTU! MUMBUTU! MUMBUTU!""

They then proceed to sodomize the man, one by one, until the entire tribe had violated him- but he lived, and was released. He crawled away from the tribe toward the direction of their shared hut, crying.

The second Anthropologist was appalled by this behavior. He summoned his pride and his gall and told them all the he chose death.

On his first day, he takes off his clothes and starts wandering around. A gorgeous petite blonde walks by him and Bob immediately gets an erection.

The woman notices his erection, comes over to him grinning sweetly and says, “Sir, did you call for me?”

Bob replies, “No, what do you mean?”

She says, “You must be new here; let me explain. It’s a rule here that if I give you an erection, it implies you called for me.” Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lies down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.

Bob is very happy and continues exploring the facilities. 

He enters a sauna, sits down and lets one rip. 

Within a few seconds a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out of the steam towards him. The huge man says, “Sir, did you call for me?”

Bob replies, “No, what do you mean?”

The huge man says, “You must be new here; it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me.” The huge man then easily spins Bob around, bends him over the bench and has his way with him.

Bob rushes back to the colony office. He is greeted by the smiling, naked, receptionist. “May I help you sir?”

Bob says, “Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 membership fee.”

The shocked receptionist says, “But, sir, you’ve only been here a couple of hours. You have only seen a small fraction of our facilities.”

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ""I sure did,"" and held up my thumb to show her.

The policeman approaches the drivers door.

The policeman says, ""Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?""

""You don't have one?""
The man responds, ""I lost it four times for drink driving.""

The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""
The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""
The man replies, ""I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too!""",A driver gets pulled over by a policeman for speeding,33

The next day, St. Peter went to his place at the front gates of Heaven, and three men were there, waiting for him. He beckoned the first man to approach and relay the story of his death.

""I was an average kind of guy. Worked the office, lived in a New York apartment on the 4th floor with my wife, and served God well my whole life. On the day of my death, I became sick, and left work to come home early. When I came in, I saw my wife lying in bed, sleeping, which I of course found odd, since she left for work that morning, and usually doesn't get off until much later. Naturally I grew suspicious that she might have been unfaithful, so I started searching through the house. The closet, underneath the bed, behind every door and shower curtain...

I couldn't find the guy, so I went out on the balcony to draw some deep breaths and calm down.. I shouldn't be so quick to judge after all. I had just decided to go in and wake her up and ask why she was home, when I looked down, and saw the fucker! He was hanging there from the edge of the balcony, hoping I wouldn't see him, looking up at me with his pleading eyes. I stepped on his hands, and his grip fell loose, plummeting down into a large bush. He survived the fall however, so in my blind rage, I went in, ripped the fridge out of the socket, and tossed it straight at the guy, crushing him flat.

The excersion and rage gave me an aneurysm shortly after, and well.. here I am.""

St. Peter scratches his head for a minute after hearing the man's tale, but since he just openly admitted to killing a man in a fit of anger, the clouds open up beneath the man's feet, and he plummets down into hell.

The next man comes forward and starts talking.

""I was an average kind of guy. Devoted to God of course, was unemployed a lot of the time, but could just afford a nice New York apartment on the 5th floor. On the day of my death I had slept in until noon I guess, and stepped out on the balcony to do some gymnastics in the sun.

While I was doing jumping jacks I accidentally lost balance, and tumbled out over the ledge. I felt my life flash before my eyes, but as luck would have it, I managed to grab hold of the balcony us beneath mine! I held on there for maybe ten minutes until my downstairs neighbour came out. I looked up at him with pleading and relief, but before I could speak a word or ask for help, he stomped down on my fingers, and I let go with a scream, certain this time, that I was done for. But no! After falling for what felt like an eternity spanning only a few seconds, I landed in a large bush. I broke some bones for sure, but I was alive!

That was.. until the same psychopath came out and threw a fridge in my face.. and here I am.""

St. Peter stood for a minute, digesting the story and connecting some dots, before welcoming the guy into heaven.

The last man now stepped forward, and St. Peter asked him to tell his tale.

""O-o-kk-k-kay... er.. You.. Yeah, you're gonna have to, uh.. have to bear with me here, a-alright? Step in my shoes for a sec, yeah?

... So.. okay, picture this: you're butt naked, hiding in a fridge.""",Heaven was running out of spots for new souls,201

So he went in PISSED. He was cussing, and yelling, eventually the manager comes out and gets his story, helps him clean up, gave him credit for the gas, which calmed the guy down a bit, enough to continue on with his day.

So hes driving down the highway, and decides he needs a smoke. He goes to light a cigarette, and his arm is engulfed in flames. 

He's in the middle lane so he can't just pull over, so he sticks his arm out the window, waving it around hoping the wind will put the fire out. Luckily though there was a sheriff a couple cars back, so he flips on his siren, gets everyone out of the way so the guy can park, and runs up with his jacket and throws it on the guys arm.

So now he's mad, in pain, his day just can't get any worse.

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over the lake, as it's a valuable resource to posses. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the knights of the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights if the second aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.

In the third camp the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew, and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights of the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight of the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires of all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

And it just goes to show you how the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

post,7fe4ev,2qh72,jokes,false,1511600263,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7fe4ev/bought_the_wife_a_gift/,self.jokes,,"Yesterday  I saw something at The Army Disposal Shop that sparked my interest. I was looking for a little something different for my wife Rebecca. 

What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized Tazer.
The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety...??
WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home.. I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.
AWESOME!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Rebecca what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.
Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two AAA batteries, right?
There I sat in my recliner, my dog craig looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target.
I must admit I thought about zapping Craig  (for a fraction of a second) and then thought better of it. He is such a soft dog. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.
Am I wrong?
So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a singlet with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and Tazer in another.
The directions said that:
a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant;
a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; and
a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.
Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.
All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference (loaded with two itsy, bitsy AAA batteries); pretty cute really, and thinking to myself, 'no possible way!'
What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.
I'm sitting there alone, the dog looking on with his head cocked to one side so as to say, 'Don't do it stupid,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it.
I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and...
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT THE... !!!
I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs! The dog was making sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the lounge, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room.
Note:
If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer,
one note of caution:
There is NO such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor!
A three second burst would be considered conservative!
A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape.
· My bent reading glasses were on the top of the TV.
· The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was.
· My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching.
· My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs.
· I had no control over the drooling.
· Apparently I had crapped in my shorts, but was too numb to know for sure, and my sense of smell was gone.
· I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair.
I'm still looking for my testicles and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return!

Having never really been religious, but also desperate and feeling he had nothing to lose, he heeded the celestial voice, and picked up the heavy stone and smashed in the skull of the chief.  

He looked around at the shocked faces of all the rest of the tribe when the booming voice returned, saying “There you go. *Now* you're fucked!”",Explorer in the jungle (NSFW language),17

The seventh and final alien learns “Finally, some excitement!” from a sports ad. 

After buying the groceries, the aliens head back to their spaceship by the railroad. However, on the way, they found a dead man, and a cop on the scene. The officer comes over to the aliens and begins interrogating them, one by one. 

He asks the first alien “Do you know who killed this man?”

The first alien replies “Us.”

Shocked, he asks “What?” 

Again, the first alien says “Us.”

The cop asks “How?”

The second alien replies “FORKS AND KNIVES!”

The cop asks “Where?”

“In the bathtub...”

“When?”

“Right now!”

“Why??”

“For the sake of Pepsi!”

The waiter comes by and asks him what he would like to eat.

The man says, “I’ll have one of your world-famous burgers with lettuce and onions on it.”

The waiter responds, “I’m sorry sir, but we’re fresh out of onions.”

“Oh, that’s fine. I’ll just have some French Onion Soup, then.”

“Sir, I told you, we’re out of onions.”

“I understand. I’ll have some onion-stuffed quesadilla.”

“Sir for the last time, we are out of onions.”

“Alright, alright! I hear you! I’m not that hungry anyways, I’ll just get those all-natural onion rings you have there.”

The frustrated waiter, growing impatient, sighs, and looks at the man.

“Look,” he says. “What do you get if you take the ‘milk’ out of ‘buttermilk?’”

The man, confused, replies, “Uh, you just have the word butter.”

“And what do you get if you take the ‘straw’ out of ‘strawberry?’”

The man, still perplexed, responds, “Berry.”

“And what do you get if you take the ‘fuck’ out of ‘onions?’”

“There ain’t no ‘fuck’ in ‘onions!’”

“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you!”

Sally sits him down, and explains to Henry, her conditions. ""Henry"" she says, in a sultry voice, "" I have a few rules be for we have some fun. I need money up front, and the lights must be off"". Henry readily agrees, and hands her the forty dollars and leans over and flicks the lights off, ""let's do this!"" He exclaims happily. Sally starts taking off his pants and gets right to business, really going to town on his nether regions! Henry is in pure bliss! this had to be the best blowie he had ever received, but the best part is when she started singing the national anthem!
