The only job applicant is a hunchback with no arms. Bishop: ""How can you do the job? You can't pull the rope!"" Hunchback: ""I have a plan - but we have to go to the top of the tower, where the bell is."" .. So they climb all those stairs to the top of the tower. Bishop: ""Ok, show me your plan.""

The hunchback runs and jumps at the bell, striking it with his head. Sure enough, he rings the bell. 

So despite his misgivings, the bishop hired the hunchback to ring the bell.

Every day the hunchback comes in and rings the bell. One day, the hunchback decides to try to ring the bell louder. He goes to the farthest corner of the tower, and runs as fast as he can toward the bell. When he jumps up and hits it with his head, the bell rings clear and loud. Unfortunately, the hunchback hit the bell so hard he's a little groggy. He staggers around a bit, and falls out a window to the street below.

A crowd gathers around the hunchback's mangled body lying in the street; the bishop goes out to investigate the commotion.

The policeman arrives and again asks: ""Who is this guy?"" The bishop replies: ""I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell.""

Each fart would smell like jackshit and cause his Wife to feel nausea as well.

One day his Wife got so angry that she yelled at him that he would fart his guts out if he continued farting like that.

The very next morning, she woke up very early and left the room undetected. She ran to the kitchen and scooped out the innards of a raw turkey that was going to be cooked that night. She hurried back to their room and silently placed the turkey innards under her Husband’s ding dong.

She then ran to the living room and hid under the table, screaming to wake her husband up.
When her Husband finally woke from the deep slumber, his ear piercing scream could be heard from all over the house.

Waiting for a few moments, the Wife decided to enter the room and mock him for falling for the joke. However when she entered the room, she saw nothing but bloodied sheets and her Husband sweating profusely.

Worried, she asked what had happened.

Her Husband replied in a surprisingly calm tone, in between ragged breaths, “You were right Mary! I actually did fart out my damn guts this morning!”

He then raised his index and middle finger and spoke proudly, “...but with these 2 fingers and the help of god I managed to stuff my guts back up my ass!”",There was this couple who had lived together for 10 years,4

Now Sally sat behind Jimmy, and Sally was concerned for Jimmy's soul. To ensure that Jimmy was awake for the teacher's lesson, she would poke him with her pencil. 

She did this 4 times when she caught Jimmy snoring - and each time he tried to swat away the penicl. 

The teacher realized Jimmy had his head down on the desk and wasn't paying attention - so she decided to call on him to answer a question in an attempt to get him to focus. 

""So Jimmy, what did Eve say to Adam after their 21st child?"" 

Sally, realizing Jimmy didn't hear the question because he was nearly asleep at this point, attempted to jolt him awake by poking him once more with her pencil. 

Jimmy shot his head up and yelled, ""If you stick that thing in me one more God damn time, I'm going to break it in half!!!"" 

The teacher left the room and was never heard from again.

""Fifteen dollars.""

""OK, and how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?""

""Get out of my fucking cab!"" The driver snarls.

After watching Satan do this several times, the man’s curiosity got the better of him. So he strolled over and tapped Satan on the shoulder.

“Excuse me, Prince of Darkness,” he said. “I’m waiting in line for my judgment, but I couldn’t help wondering, why are you tossing those people aside instead of flinging them into the fires of Hell with the others?”

Another half hour passed before another relative asked, “may we see the new baby now?”

“No, not yet,” said the mother.

A while later the guests asked again, “may we see the baby now?”
“No, not yet,” replied the mother.

A guys car breaks down, but fortunately it breaks down right in front of a Monestarey. He trudges through the snow to knock on the door and one of the monks answers.
 Monk: ""Hello my child, how may we help you?""

The Guy: ""Hey there, I don't mean to be too much of a bother but my car broke down and I can't get it towed until the morning, would you guys have a place I could sleep for the night?""

Monk: ""Of course! Greg was a mechanic before he joined the order, he'll get your car fixed up and we'll get you out of here in the morning. We were just about to have dinner, come join us.""

The Guy: ""Man, you don't have to do that I just...""

Monk cutting the guy off: ""Nonsense, it's all in the name of God.""

The monk ushers the guy in and they give him a nice home cooked meal using meat and vegetables they raised themselves. After that they show him to his room for the night and tell him his car will be ready in the morning. As he's laying there he hears these really weird noises, but he manages to put it out of his head and go to sleep. The next morning he wakes up and has breakfast with the monks, and afterwards they hand him back his keys.

The Guy: ""Guys I really appreciate this, you didn't have to do any of this and it means a lot to me.

Monk: ""Of course! All in the name of God, my child.""

The guy starts to walk out the door but turns around before he leaves

The Guy: ""Oh by the way, what were the noises I heard last night?""

Monk: ""Oh, we can't tell you that. You're not a monk.""

The guy thinks this is fair and heads on his way. Several years later he's going down the same road and his car breaks down again, so he walks up to the door and asks if he could stay the night again saying that they don't have to feed him or fix the car this time. He gets told that's nonsense and to come inside. After dinner he heads to bed but hears those noises again. He finally manages to go to sleep. After breakfast the next morning he jokingly asks about the noises and gets the same answer. He stops and thinks about it then says

The Guy: ""You know what? Screw it. What do I need to do to become a monk?""

Monk: ""Really?""

The Guy: ""Yeah! Screw it! I have this shitty 9 to 5 desk job that I hate. I'll never be able to get rid of this car. I'm stuck in this loveless marriage with my wife who I'm pretty sure is cheating on me with Steve from work. Also I don't think either one of my ungrateful shit head kids is mine. So screw it. What do I need to do to become a monk?""

Monk: ""Well if you're that serious about it... You have to go out into the world and count every blade of grass and every pebble then come back to us with your answer.""

The guy turns around and walks out the door and immediately starts counting blades of grass and Pebbles. Now he's very expeditious about this and 40 years later he returns. At this point he's an old hunch back from spending all this time looking at the ground and his skin is leathered and tan from spending 40 years in the sun. However he gives them his answer, and he's right! He did it. They welcome him into the Brotherhood with open arms.

The Guy: ""Thank you so much for this opportunity. I've learned so much, not only about the world but myself as well on this journey. It's opened my eyes to so many things and ideas. Although it doesn't matter to me any more I still feel like I need to ask, do I get to know what the noises are now?""

The monks tell him that he ineed does and hand him a big ring of keys then take him to this big wooden door. He unlocks it, but behind it is an even bigger door made of iron. 
Then one of steel. 
Then one of bronze. 
Then one of silver. 
Then this HUGE door made of gold.
He turns to his newfound brothers as if to ask a question but they cut him off. 

Monk: ""Fear not my brother, all the answers you seek lie past one more door""

So he opens the gold door, then sees this massive door made of pure diamond. It's so big that you could drive a semi truck through it and it wouldn't even touch the sides. He walks up to it and unlocks it, and the click it makes echoes throughout the room. Then with all of his might he pushes open the door just wide enough to see what's inside. Then he sees it! He sees what was causing the noises, and he has this sudden moment of realization where things in the universe start to make sense and he has answers to questions he never knew that he had. 


But I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A guys car breaks down in front of a Monestarey,31

He approaches the drunkard, who is well plastered and hasn't yet seen him coming .  ""Evening, friend.  How we doing tonight?""

""Oh officer,"" says the souse, "" Am I glad to see you, sir!  Listen, somebody stole my car!""

""Huh.  Got your car, did they?""  Skeptical, the cop prods him.  ""Well, tell me, where did you last see it?""

The drunk holds up his keychain and mumbles ""It was right here, right on the end of this key.""

Cop stops for a second and maybe deep in his mind somewhere he wonders how his life ever came to this.  But that doesn't solve the problem at hand.  ""Friend,"" he says, thinking quickly, ""the Precinct House is three blocks behind me, right back that way.  Just follow this street and you can't miss it.  Now, you just head down there &amp; tell them what happened.  They'll file the appropriate paperwork and get an investigation started for you.  Sound good?""

Satisfied with this answer, the drunk obliges.  ""Wow, thank you officer, I really appreciate it.  I'll get down there right now"". And he starts to walk off.  

""All right, good luck with your case then, citizen,"" says the cop.  But before the drunk gets away he adds, ""Oh hey my friend, before you go down there to the station, why don't you zip up that fly?  Your cock's hanging right out the front of 'em"".

Drunk looks down and sure enough there's his dick just waving in the wind.  His expression suddenly saddens.  ""Oooooh officer...I think they got my girl too.""

An elderly couple was celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighborhood after they retired. Holding hands, they walked back to their old school. It was not locked, so they entered. They found the old desk they'd shared, where Jerry had carved ‘I love you, Sally’. 

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armoured car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money -  fifty thousand dollars! 

Jerry said, ""We've got to give it back.""

Sally said, ""Finders keepers.""
She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic. 

The next day, two police officers, who were canvassing the neighbourhood looking for the money, knocked on their door. ""Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armoured car yesterday?"" 

Sally said, ""No."" 

Jerry said, ""She’s lying. She hid it up in the attic."" 

Sally said, ""Don't believe him, he’s getting senile.""

It always gets in the way, he has to wrap it around his leg wherever he goes, and it never fits in a woman.

So he goes to this magic wizard to help him get a shorter dick.  The wizard tells him to go into the nearby forest and find this talking frog.  The wizard tells the man to ask the frog to marry him and if the frog says no then his dick will shrink 5 inches.

So the man ventures into the forest and lo and behold he finds the talking frog.  He goes to the frog and asks:

""Frog, will you marry me?""

The frog is baffled by the request and responds with a stern

""No!""

And just as the wizard said his dick shrunk 5 inches, so he asked the frog again:

""Frog, will you marry me??""

The frog, slightly annoyed, responds again with:

""Are you kidding me? No!!""

And just as the first time his dick shrunk another 5 inches.  Now the man thought to himself, 10 inches is a perfectly sized dick, if he could just shrink his dick another 5 inches that would be perfect!
So he asks the frog one more time:

""Frog, will you marry me???""

And the frog responds:

""Didn't you hear me the first two times?! No, No, NO!!!""",So a man has a 25 inch dick,71

He was far from home, far from his wife, so he thought to himself ""well, my wife will never know if I fuck a hooker here"". So, there he is in this bordel and he goes to receptionist and says ""I'd like to buy a hooker, but I don't have much money on me. I have something like $100"". 
Receptionist looks at him and goes like ""okay sir, this may sound kinda strange... But, are you willing to have sex with a kangaroo?"" 
This guy was shocked by this question, but he said ""well, that would be weird but at the same time it's a new experience... Ok, let's do that."" 
""great"" said receptionist ""go to the room number three, kangaroo will be there"" 
So, this guy goes in and there is a kangaroo as promised. So felt a little bit strange but he fucked that kangaroo. As he leaves, receptionist asks how it was. Guy said ""it was great, I never had such a good time. And these mirrors in the room were great, I could watch myself while banging this beast"" and receptionist said ""we're glad you enjoyed it. I wish you a great day sir..."" 
So few days passed, this guy was like ""I could spend some money on kangaroo again"" so he went to the bordel and straight from the door he says ""I want a kangaroo again"" 
Receptionist said ""we're so sorry sir, but kangaroo is not here today... But, we have something else. It may sound weird, but there is a group of people who masturbate on people having sex in this glass room. You could join this group if you are interested."" 
This guy was like ""well, group masturbation is pretty new to me. Maybe I should give it a try. It's a new experience."" so he went in this room, and there were people masturbating on these people having sex in this box. He joins them. So after few moments he said to guy next to him ""well this is kinda boring..."" and this man answers ""yo man, few days ago there was a guy fucking a kangaroo!

At Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (where they assemble a bunch of the spacecraft that they go on interplanetary missions on, such as Voyager 1 &amp; 2, all of the mars probes, and Cassini, for a few examples) round 2010 or so, they were working on the Mars Science Laboratory, known better as the Curiosity rover, and there had been a bunch of setbacks at the time. They were worrying that they were going to be over-budget, and with the launch only a couple of years away they were somewhat rushed to complete it. I knew a friend who did a tour of the place back then and the whole clean room was apparently full of gadgets and various machines and shit.

Anyway, an indicent happened not long after that ended up causing a fairly well-hidden setback to the rover, and ended up causing its launch to delay for most of a year. Basically there was this stray cat that lived in the general area of JPL, people had seen it wandering all over the area at its leisure and had become sort of a group pet in a way. Anyway, exactly 8 years ago on June 14th, 2010 (which is why I'm bringing it up), this cat was apparently feeling rather exploratory and managed to sneak into their clean room along with an obviously inattentive worker, and by the time they noticed he did it was a bit too late. They'd wasted the better part of the hour trying to corral the cat (which ended up being very difficult trying to do with all of the various carefully-constructed machines lying everywhere) all the while sweating about their imminent firing.

The standoff finally tragically concluded when the cat wandered over to one of the worst areas he could: to the Curiosity rover's main power supply. Unfortunately, the cat was electrocuted instantly upon contact, and the technicians delayed the next couple of days in memory of the loss of the cat that many had seen wandering around the region for the last several months...

In other words, Curiosity killed the cat.",Didn't you hear about that scandal at NASA's JPL in Pasadena?,4

As energetic as they come, they start off with a bang. With a handful of eager young protons joining their ranks, they begin to see extremely positive gains in their investments in no time. They're making more money than they know what to do with.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


But this comes at a cost, hidden away from the world. Blue collar neutrons are being taken advantage of at every step. They're underpaid, treated with disrespect, biased against, and exploited in every possible manner. They unionize in protest, but the cosmic rays are too powerful to fight against. Ever-increasing lawyer fees and expenses push a small group of neutrons to the edge, and they form an underground rebel group.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


In the middle of a peaceful and silent night, this group assassinates the leaders of the cosmic ray establishment, one by one.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


The world is turned upside down. Investors panic while their financial advisors try unconvincingly to maintain profits. The police conduct a raid, and following a series of investigations, they arrest the rebel group of neutrons.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


One thing leads to another, and the court date is set for the neutrons' defense. They show up, attempting to hide their faces from the paparazzi as they walk in.
In the court room, the judge orders everyone to be seated. Then, to everyone's surprise, they say that the rebel group can leave in freedom. This is before either side has even had a chance to present their case.
The crowd gasps. ""Why?!"" someone is heard yelling.

The violent and clockwork nature of Alf’s farting seemed to be an inhuman ability and Doris constantly warned Alf that one day he would fart his guts right out into his shorts. 
&amp;nbsp;

One Xmas morning Doris got up early to prepare the turkey. She decided to teach old Alf a lesson and after digging all the giblets from inside the massive turkey, she crept upstairs where Alf was fast asleep and snoring. She carefully pulled his shorts back and filled them up with 4 pounds of turkey innards and went back downstairs to wait for the magic to happen. 
&amp;nbsp;

Sure enough she heard Alf wake himself up with a real ripper and then she hears blood curdling screams “DORIS DORIS, QUICK, DORIS” 
&amp;nbsp;

Doris has to take a few minutes to compose herself and let the giggling subside before she goes upstairs to see what’s wrong. 
&amp;nbsp;

When she gets upstairs Alf is in a terrible state, he is red in the face and sweating and he shouts “Oh Doris you were right, after all these years you were right, it finally happened, I **did** shit my guts right out into my shorts”
&amp;nbsp;

Doris desperately tries to keep a straight face and tells her dear husband not to worry. 
&amp;nbsp;

Alf says “oh I’m not worried, by the grace of god and with a steady hand I managed to get them all back up again!”",Alf and Doris have been married for 50 years,4

She decides to let some of the kids go home for the holidays early as a treat. She first asks Ben what he did at lunch time. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ben says he played football with Tyler. The teacher says that if Ben can spell “foot” he can go home early for the holidays. F-O-O-T replies Ben and off he goes like a flash. 

&amp;nbsp;

She then says to Tyler if he can spell “ball” he can also go home early. B-A-L-L says Tyler before running out the door with glee. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next the teacher asks Sanjay what he did at lunchtime. He says that he wanted to play football with Ben and Tyler but they wouldn’t let him because he is Asian and he smells. He goes on to say how his daddy would say it’s racial discrimination. 

&amp;nbsp;

The teacher replies “Oh Sanjay, that is terrible! Tell you what, if you can spell “racial discrimination” you can go home early too”

His wife, none too happy that he would spend so much money on sports memorabilia, demanded he take it back. After much arguing, he finally relented.  

Unfortunately, when the man returned to the sports store, the store owner refused to accept any returns.  

""Sir, we only craft the highest quality products,"" the owner said. ""We are so confident in our products, we guarantee them for life, but we will only accept returns if it's broken.""  

The man was dismayed, but he crafted a plan. When he returned home, he took the fan up to the roof and threw it over! Upon inspecting it, however, not only was it intact, he didn't even make a scratch.  

Then he got out a hammer and started swinging away, but he didn't even make a dent in the plastic.  

Finally he called up his friend, who had an oversized pickup truck. They put the fan out in the street and ran over the fan at high speed! Unfortunately, all they managed to do was break the truck's axle. As the two men got out of the truck, the man's friend inspected their work and said,
