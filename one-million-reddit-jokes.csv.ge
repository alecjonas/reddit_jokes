One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.

The little boy says, ""It's dark in here.""
The man whispers, ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball.""
Man - ""That's nice.""
Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$250.""

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet together.

Boy - ""It's dark in here.""
Man - ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball glove.""
Man - Remembering last time, asks, ""How much?""
Boy - ""$750.""
Man - ""Fine.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball.""

The boy says, ""I can't. I sold them.""

The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""

The son says ""$1,000.""

The father says, ""It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.""

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

The boy says, ""It's dark in here.""
The priest says, ""Don't start that crap again!""","""It's dark in here""",77

This has really a great suspense...!!!!!

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end .

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",[LONG] The Monk,6

Eager to impress, the female Lieutenant busts open the cell door and grabs the first thief by the scruff of the neck and asks him “What did you do before you joined the army scum?” The thief replies, “I was a butcher”.

Thinking on her feet the female Lieutenant grabs a chefs clever and chops his cock off.

She asks the second thief the same question. Sweating profusely he replies “I was a fireman.”

So, he rents a car, and he sets off on his quest to find some peace of mind.

As he drives along a beautiful country road, he sees something odd in the distance. As he gets closer, he can see that it is a farmer standing under a tree near the road holding a pig. Curious, he pulls to the side of the road. He watches intently as the farmer picks up one pig after another to let them eat an apple from the tree. This curious behavior fascinates the businessman as he watches this go on for several minutes. Finally, he can no longer contain himself. He calls out to the farmer, “Excuse me sir, but what exactly are you doing?” The farmer calmly replies, “Why, feeding the pigs, of course.” The businessman is a little surprised. He calls out to the farmer again, “But, wouldn’t it save a lot of time if you just shook the tree to cause the apples to fall to the ground so that the pigs could eat them there?” The farmer looks at the businessman, confused, and he replies, “Time?

An attorney arrived home late, after a very tough day trying to get a stay of execution. His last minute plea for clemency to the governor had failed and he was feeling worn out and depressed.

As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him about, ‘What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been? Dinner is cold and I’m not reheating it’. And on and on and on.

Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs.

While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband’s client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight.

Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go upstairs and give him the good news.

As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet.

‘They’re not hanging Wright tonight,’ she said.

The husband gets irate and starts shouting at the man. “ Who the fuck are you and why are you in my house?“. 

The man responds, “Calm down, when the ball went through the window it bounced off the floor and hit the vase is that was on your mantle. The vase broke and I popped out, I am a Genie And I am here to grant you two wishes and the third is a wish I get to keep for myself. I’m a different kind of Genie and it takes 24 hours for my wishes to come true.”

The husband changes his tune and begins conjuring two wishes he would love to come true.

For his first wish the man asks to have perfect health for the rest of his life.

“Done” says the genie. 

For his second wish, he asks for $1 million.

“it will be in your bank account in 24 hours“ Responds the genie. 

The husband at this point is really excited and he says to the genie “thank you Genie for all you have done, can I ask what you’d like your wish to be?”

The genie response that he’d like to have sex with his wife. He says it gets lonely being in the bottle for thousands of years.

The husband looks at the wife and she responds “I guess with what he’s done for us and if you’re OK with it, I guess I could return the favor“. 

“Then it is a done deal” says the genie. 

That night the genie and the wife are in a hotel room. The two of them screw like rabbits for four hours straight, it’s the best sex she’s had since college. 

The next morning while sitting in bed, The wife tells the genie that that was the most amazing sex she’s ever had.

“Agreed“, says the genie. “But I have one question for you before I go?“

I wouldn’t *release* for a week - 2 weeks at a time, sometimes 3.  And became notorious in my family for crushing bathrooms.  Throughout my entire life I never witnessed my father struggle with much, he’s a strong guy who put up with a lot of abuse when he was younger, he really turned his lemons to gold,  and physically a powerhouse... but watching him battle the plumbing for sometimes hours at a time after I came through lead a plethora of emotions for my young mind to cope ranging from bafflement to straight up demoralization.

Looking back, I can’t even imagine how he felt.  It’s something we don’t talk about really, and I size it up to the level of at least mild post-traumatic stress.  

So one time I go at my uncles, before I go in I specifically remember him saying, “hey dude don’t plug the piping!” jokingly we had a laugh, but then it actually happened.  So the same routine goes down, I try to plunge.  My uncle takes up to bat next, but he’s got heart problems so it defeated him and I with genuine ease.  My dad showed up later on, he’s going to town.  Nothing.  Dad teeters between full rampage, berserking mode and scientific breakthrough, fashioning customized devices to help combat the situation after trying to Schwarzenegger the thing.  He would fail this day.

Uncle calls the plumber.  Plumber comes down, dude can’t get the thing unplugged through his arsenal of tools designed strictly for situations as these.  Calls up what I assumed was the wizard of plumbing.  No luck.  Plumber ends up having to call the city to get them involved.  City deploys an engineer to come checks things out.  Guy comes down with blueprints.  The city ends up employing an excavation crew for this situation.  Excavation crew ends up having to tear up the pipes in the middle of the street which also happened to be a 3-way intersection on the busiest road in this suburb of around 5,000 and subsequently had to redirect the main flow of traffic for at least a 1/3rd of the population for a good week.

However it is very brittle and crushes to dust as soon as it is touched, and a genie pops out.

""I don't normally grant wishes to more than one person, but I'll make an exception,"" the genie says. ""Each of you will be allowed 3 wishes.""

He asks the first man for his first wish, and without hesitation, the man responds that he wants to be the richest man in the world. The second man immediately wishes for a 1967 Corvette Stingray. Finally the genie asks the third man for his first wish, and the third man thinks for a moment.

""I wish for my left arm to rotate clockwise,"" the third man says. Thinking this is a very strange request, the genie grants the man his wish and his left arm begins spinning clockwise.

For his second wish, the first man wants to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and a gorgeous Brazilian model appears at his side. The second man wishes for his very own Lady Moura yacht. The third man, with his left arm spinning uncontrollably, finally settles on his second wish.

""I wish for my right arm to rotate counterclockwise,"" he says. Now in 400 billion years the genie has never encountered such a strange set of wishes, but nonetheless he is bound to honor them and so the man's right arm now begins to spin counterclockwise.

Now on to his third wish, the first man asks for a beautiful house on his own private island in the Caribbean and disappears. The second man asks for a mansion, and he too disappears. The genie waits patiently as the third man thinks studiously for several long moments, both arms flailing in opposite directions.

""I wish for my head to nod up and down uncontrollably,"" he says finally. The genie is at a complete loss for what this man has up his sleeve, but nonetheless decides to grant it so he can return to a nice quiet vase to rest, and the man's head now begins to nod up and down uncontrollably.

The three men live their lives without any contact for many years, before one day deciding to meet in a bar to catch up.

""Fellas, I can't believe my fortune!"" exclaims the first man. ""I can buy anything I want and I get to fuck the most beautiful woman in the world!""

""Nevermind that, I'm just happy that I've gotten to drive my '67 Stingray and sail my yacht around the seven seas,"" says the second man. ""And no wife to nag me in my giant mansion!""

They both look at the third man, head nodding and arms flailing.

and had a little sweet potato, which they called 'Yam.'
Of course, they wanted the best for Yam. 
When it was time, they told her about the facts of life.
They warned her about going out and getting half-baked, so she wouldn't get accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like 'Hot Potato,' and end up with a bunch of tater tots.
Yam said not to worry, no spud would get her into the sack and make a rotten potato out of her!
But on the other hand, she wouldn't stay home and become a couch potato either.
She would get plenty of exercise so as not to be skinny like her shoestring cousins.
When she went off to Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Potato told Yam to watch out for the hard-boiled guys from Ireland and the greasy guys from France called the French fries.
And when she went out West, to watch out for the Indians so she wouldn't get scalloped.
Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn't associate with those high-class Yukon golds, or the ones from the other side of the tracks who advertise their trade on all the trucks that say, 'Frito Lay.'
Mr. And Mrs. Potato sent Yam to Idaho P.U. (that's Potato University ) so that when she graduated she'd really be in the Chips.
But in spite of all, they did for her, one-day Yam came home and announced she was going to marry Tom Brokaw.
Tom Brokaw!?!
Mr. And Mrs. Potato were very upset.
They told Yam she couldn't possibly marry Tom Brokaw because he's just...

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

„There are a lot of different positions so let’s see how many we can name.“, he says.

The students are all a little hesitant to answer.

But from one of the last rows one of the boys shouts: „69!“

The teacher ignores it and asks Maria in the first row what position she can think of.

„The one where the woman sits on top.“ she answers.

Teacher: „Very good Maria. That‘s the cowgirl position. Anybody else?“

„69!“, says the boy from the back again.

Teacher: „Robin, what about you? Do you know a position?“

„Uhm“, Robin says, visibly embarrased, „The one where the penis penetrates the vagina from behind the woman?“

Teacher: „You‘re right. That‘s called doggystyle. How many more can you guys tell me?“

„69!“ is once again heard from the back of the class.

„Kelly, can you tell me about a position you know?“, the teacher asks another one of the girls.

Kelly: „The woman on her back with the man on top maybe?“

Teacher: „Excellent Kelly! That is the missionary position.“

The room is silent until once again from the back of the row the same guy shouts: „70!“

After a good night's rest, the man wakes up, and notices his friends are gone. Surprised, he walks downstairs and asks the receptionist where they went.

He said he found a medicinal eye-drop online that could make his son see be able for the first time.

The kid was happier than ever, but the father said:

""But son, I don't have enough money to buy it yet, you'll have to be patient."" 

""It's gonna take too long?"" Said the kid

""Probably around 2 or 3 months, but I promise that I'll make this happen!"" Replied the father.

So as time went by, the kid got everyday more anxious about his medicinal eye-drops

""Hey dad! Do you have it already?"" 

""Nah son, I don't have the money yet, but I'm saving it!"" 

That was the convertation around the house for almost 4 months, but finally, the father came home with good news:

""SON! I finally bought it!!"" 

""OMG DAD! Where is it??"" 

""Calm down boy, I made the purchase online, so we have to wait a little until it arrives!"" 

""Ok then!"" 

6 days went by, then the mail man finally delivered a box from china on their porch, the father told his son and he couldn't be happier! 

""Dad! DAD! I can't believe it arrived! Drop it in my eyes, I wanna see the world!!"" Said the kid

""Son, this is gonna be the most important family event in our history, you finally will be able to see! So I invited your gramma and grampa, your cousins, your uncles and aunts and some family friends, so we can all appreciate this moment together, but they will arrive tomorrow, is it ok to you?"" 

""C'mon dad, can't I even drop a little drop in just one eye?""

""Let's do this the right way ok? Let's share this moment with all the special people we are surrounded by!""

""Ok then..."" Said the reluctant son

The next day, their living room was filled with people, relatives and family friends, around 35 people.

The father started a little rant:

""Ladies and gentleman! This is gonna be the most remembered family event in our history! My beloved son will finally be able to see the world, and its beautiful colors. See his family, his father, his house!"" 

Then he grabbed the eye-drops and called his son, who sat on a chair, almost crying out of joy.

Then the father dropped 2 drops on each eye and said

""Blink 3 times and look at us son!""

The son did it, but was still blind 

""Dad, I still can't see!""

In this moment, everybody who was there yelled at the same time:

They have been drinking at the same bar on the same day of the week every single week for 4 years now and the bartenders usually just close the bar and leave the doors unlocked for them to leave when they want to.

Brad lives in a bungalow just across the street from the Bar and Josh leaves across town.

5 hours into their drinking session Josh says that he cannot drink anymore and that he has already texted his wife to pick him up. Before he passes out at their table he says that Brad need not wait for him and should just go home across the street to their house.

Brad looking at this passed out friend initially tries to wake him up. Messing up his hair, flicking at his ears, and, finally dousing him with leftover water from the pitcher on their table.

""Damn it! He is out of it."" Brad says to himself. ""I think I better get up and go home then.""

Brad tries to get up and immediately loses control, falls almost sideways as he was too drunk to hold on to their table.

Brad's forehead is smashed open and he immediately he starts bleeding.

He cursed loudly and looked at the door and thought that it was not that far to crawl to. So crawl he went. As he got to the door he pushed himself up and almost immediately loses his balance. He threw his hand forward hoping to hold on to the doorknob but even though he was able to reach out only managed to turn the know and push the door slightly open.

Brad hit the floor and this time smashes his nose. He cursed loudly to no one but managed to look up and see through the door that the light was open at his house and decided to crawl out to the sidewalk.

Brad crawled forward drunkenly, bleeding badly from the gash on his forehead and his nose. As he got to the side of the road he looks up sideways and sees that no cars were coming from either way. ""Fuck! Fucking fuck, I am not that drunk!"" he slurred loudly. ""I can do this shit!"", he kept repeating to himself while crawling one arm after the other until he gets to their door. Immediately, he sees that the door was left slightly open probably by his wife so he would not need to fumble around for his keys to get in.

He smiled to himself, pushed himself up and started to say ""I love my w..."" when he stumbled forward and smashed his mouth on the floor.

He cursed silently, as he did not want to wake his wife. He moaned and started crawling towards their bedroom door, which like the front door was left slight ajar. He got to the foot of their bed and braced himself for the pain that he knew his face was going to feel. He counted to three pushed himself up and just as he expected, he fell face first on their bed.

His wife who was taking a shower heard the noise that Brad made when he fell on the bed that she stepped out of the shower, put on a robe and looked at his drunk husband at the bed.

She immediately, walked towards the bedroom door, sees the trail of blood to their open door. She walks out of the bedroom and closes the front door and braces herself for the conversation that was going to happen next.

She sits beside Brad and shakes him a bit to wake him up.

""Uhhgh."", grumbled Brad.

""Honey, are okay? You're so drunk!"", says his wife sweetly.

""What do you mean I'm drunk?"", asked Brad annoyed. ""I'm not drunk. I'm never drunk.""

""I think this time you really are, honey."", says his wife.

Annoyed, Brad turned over and pointed to his bloody face and asked, ""Is it because of this? Coz, this is nothing!""

""Uhrm, no honey."" said his wife.

""Well, why then?!"" said Brad loudly. ""Why?""

His wife smiled and said, ""Honey, you left your wheelchair at the bar!""

""That's amazing!"" his Dad says. ""How do I get Ol' Blue in that program?""

“Dad, he’s not here right now.  Now that he’s reading, he’s been reading philosophy, studying economics and speaking with his professors more often late into the night.  I’ll let him know you called.”

Now our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his father will find out the dog can neither talk nor read.  Dreading his return, he finally arrives home and his father runs out to the truck is all excited to see his son, but more so, Ol’ Blue.

Then I read in a gossip magazine about Drew Barrymore breaking up with comedian Justin Long. The rumor was that Justin had this lucky g-string that he wore all the time. And because of his massive junk it filled up with  a lot of sweat  and stunk the house out. Apparently Drew had enough of this stench and kicked Justin to the curb.

Now I had no idea if this was true or not, but I knew it was a great subject for a song. So I smoked some weed to get my creativity going and composed a song, writing it from the point of view of Drew saying goodbye to Justin and his horrible stench. But then I played the song for my best friend and he didn't laugh once. Just raised an eyebrow. 

So back to the drawing board I went and completely changed it up, adding  a lot more lyrics and jokes, making the melody sillier, until my friend was howling with laughter when I played the new version. 

Let me tell you, on the night of the concert I was rexcited. I knew my song was going to blow the roof off the school assembly hall.

But then tragedy struck.  As I moved to the microphone with my guitar, ready to sing,  I put the lyric sheet on the music stand. It was then I realized with horror that I had made a terrible mistake.

The  lyric sheet contained  the words for the first version of the song. The crappy version.

In complete astonishment the husband notices that he and the guide have the same tattooed letters, “W..A” on their dicks. He can see there are more letters and wonders if they have the same word tattooed. He quickly rubs his dick and shows it to the guide revealing the word “Wanda”. He says to the guide, “Is your wife’s name Wanda too?”

The guide quickly responds saying “You are funny man. Although we may be same on inside, we are much different on outside.” The guide’s eyes hint for the husband to look down again to see what’s tattooed on his penis.

I've always kinda wanted an iPhone but never had one before, so I go to the Apple Store to have a look. So there I am, when this middle aged guy comes up next to me, like really close. And then he starts asking me if I like the new iPhone, what do I think about the camera, am I thinking of getting one etc and I'm like ""Yeah, it's pretty good."" trying to play it cool because I don't wanna give away that there's no way I could even afford one if I wanted to. But then after a while, his comments start becoming personal, first complimenting my shoes and calling me a 'strapping young lad'. Now I'm quite weirded out but figure he's just new at sales and really bad at it.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I realised he's not a staff member, that he doesn't work there. So now I'm fully freaked out, this guy just came up to me and all up in my personal space, so I try to ignore him (but not trying to be subtle about it). I turn away, and get this, he sort of grabs my arm to turn me back and gives it a little squeeze and says something along the lines of ""Ooh, you been hitting the gym yeah?"". I turn to look at him and say ""Excuse me, do not touch me"" and quickly leave.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy catches up to me all apologetic, saying how sorry he is and he didn't realise he was annoying me and that. And as I'm about to say ""Yeah okay fine whatever"", he says ""Listen, here's the thing. If you give me a blowjob, I will give you this new iPhone XS"" and pulls out this new iPhone, box fresh. I was flabbergasted. I genuinely thought I'd misheard him, so had to clarify and said ""What? You want me to suck you off for a phone? Really?!"" And he smiled and nodded.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people are fucking disgusting.  Makes me sick.

The first professor boasts that he could teach anybody any subject in a matter of days, so the second professor makes a proposal. He tells the first professor that if he really can teach anyone, then he should have no problem going downtown, finding a prostitute, and giving her a college education in only a few weeks. The first professor takes him up on the challenge and heads straight to the red light district, where he finds a hooker and offers to teach her. She's tired of working the streets, so she agrees. Things go extremely well at first; the woman does well in astronomy and Latin. She quickly picks up calculus and chemistry. But, to the surprise of both professors, she seems to enjoy the subject of philosophy most of all, taking to it like a duck to water.

After just two weeks, the second professor returns to his friend's house to concede defeat. But, when he arrived at the house, the woman was nowhere to be found! He looked in the library where the woman had been studying and found it in shambles. The first professor was disheveled and holding a half empty bottle of whiskey, and looked as though he'd been sobbing.

""Dear God, man, what happened?"" the second professor asks.

""I have no idea!"" cried the first professor, tossing the bottle aside. ""We had just begun to discuss the works of the early French philosophers, and all of a sudden she became quite irrational-- throwing things and yelling-- and then she stormed out!

I’m like yeah sure what?

He asks me to drive him to the city hall after school. He says he wants to change his name to something more American.

I’m like alright dude! So after school I’m driving Ling and Ving to the city hall, and Ling is totally giving Ving the cold shoulder. I’m like what’s the deal and Ving explains that his name has been passed down for generations, and Ling is totally pissed that he’d disrespect his ancestry by changing it.

So then we get to the city hall and wait in line for a super long time. Finally it’s our turn and Ving tells me he’s picked “Lee” as his American name. He steps up to the desk and starts filling out some paperwork, and the whole time Ling is scolding him about the ancestry shit, blah blah.

Then it’s time for Ving to sign his name and seal the deal, but suddenly his eyes well up with tears and he says that he can’t do it.

Shittttt man, that ancestry shit runs deeeep.

The lady at the desk is like ok, but Ving has to pay a small fee to cancel his request.

Because of this, the farmer always blamed his second son for his mother's death. But he did not fail in his responsibilities as a father. The farmer was poor but he worked really hard to get his two sons in grad school. They didn't do well enough to get jobs. They stayed at home with their dad but the farmer never complained since his sons are all the family he had. He tried to explain to them that he was not going to be there to take care of them all the time as he was getting really old and insisted they try and find whatever jobs they could so they could support themselves. The sons agreed and started working towards getting a job. Finally after a while, the first son got a job as a librarian in the Public Library and the second son got a job as a train conductor. The farmer was very happy now that his two sons are working and he could rest in peace. One fine day, a new family moved in next to their house. The   neighboring house had always been empty the whole time they were there. The new neighbors had a beautiful daughter. The two sons were immediately attracted to her. They would do her chores, get her gifts, constantly visit her family in the pursuit of getting her attention. On fine day, the elder son went to her and told her how he really felt about her and that he would take care of her for the rest of her life. But the girl was not interested in him, so to let him off easily, she said she had feelings for his younger brother and that nothing can ever happen between them. The elder son understood and wished her all the best and left. The same evening, the younger son went to her and told her how he felt about her. She told him she liked his elder brother and that nothing could ever happen between them. The younger son did not take this well. He was furious with his brother and felt he had betrayed him. He went home to confront him about this and the two brothers got into an argument. The elder one denied that  he betrayed him and called him a fool for even thinking that. The argument got heated up so bad that they ended up fighting. In the spur of the moment, the younger one pushed his brother and accidentally killed him. He did not know what to do. His father already blames him for his mother's death. But later that evening, the farmer returned home and found his elder son dead on the floor, the younger one just sitting there cold. He could not believe this had happened. He did not show any anger towards his younger son but decided in his mind that he would put an end to all this misery. They buried the elder one in secrecy and told the neighbors he had gone abroad. After a few days, the farmer prepared a nice meal and drugged it, and asked his son to join him. His son, unsuspecting of anything, joined him for supper and had the meal and within a few minutes, was out-cold. The farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him and let him there after switching it on, hoping he   would be electrocuted and dead. But the next morning, the farmer heard his son shouting for help. So he went down and was shocked to see nothing had happened. The son cried to his father and begged for forgiveness. The farmer did not want to forgive him, but was past the rage episode so he did not want to kill him anymore. He asked his son to get out of his sight and never wanted to see him again. The son obliged and promised he would never return home and left. The son moved to another place. He had all the time to think about what he had done and regretted it. Over the next few months, he changed into a completely different human being. He became kind, calm, composed and very helpful to others. One day when he was walking down the street, he noticed a homeless person begging for food. He was moved and he got him some food and asked the homeless person to have it. While the homeless person was eating, the son noticed there was a fly on his cheek. So he tried to swat it, accidentally slapping him. The farmer who was also walking by that street saw this and thought his son hadn't changed a bit and now he is a danger to society. He decided he would finish the job once and for all. He called his son and invited him back home saying he wanted to spend the rest of his dying days with his family. The son was very happy. He went home and stayed with his father. The farmer prepared a sumptuous meal for them and again drugged his son's meal. Like earlier, the son went out-cold in a few minutes. The farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him, and switched it on. This time, the son got electrocuted and died instantly. Do you know why? Because the first time, he was a bad conductor, but now he is a good conductor. ",There was a farmer who had two sons.,4

I tried standing up, only to realise that I had been tied to the cheap metal chair. I grunted and tried to remember how I had gotten here. Last night I walked out of the club, a bit tipsy, and suddenly all went black. Ugh, I don’t know what happened, but now I’m in this room, and it doesn’t seem to be good news.  
The shadow in front of me said “I see you’re finally awake.”
“Where am I? Who are you?” I asked
“Don’t play that game with me, kid.”
“Do I know you? Is it because of Paul? I can explain everything!”
“Shut up! You’re here because you’ve angered powerful people, and they want to make sure that if you ever walk out of this room, you won’t mess with their business.”
“What are you gonna do? I don’t wanna die, please!”
“You won’t die just yet.”
He turned on a blinding light which he had aimed straight at my face. I took me a good minute to get accustomed to the brightness, then I looked around. It was an empty room, with one metal door, one lamp, and the chair I was sat in. And then there was him. Tall, black hair, blue shirt, a white three-piece suit, and matching white hat. He slowly removed a glove, and punched me in the face. The pain exploded from my nose, as I heard a cracking sound and blood started pouring out of my nostrils. That bastard had broken my nose. He then took my cheek and forced me to look at him. His hand was surprisingly soft. Too soft, almost. Then I  looked at him again, in desperation, as my brain worked at full speed. I knew that suit. I knew that hat. I knew those soft hands. I knew that punch. I’d been hit by, I’d been struck by, a smooth criminal. ",I opened my eyes sitting in a very dark room,4

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a Bulgarian man who drove trains for a living.,30

Suddenly, he was rescued and brought back to his boat by a pair of dolphins. Without thinking, the fisherman thanked them.
They replied, “You’re welcome!” Aghast, the fisherman said, “You can talk! This is amazing! Is there anything I can do to repay you for saving my life?”
“Yes, indeed,” they confirmed. “We are magical dolphins. We are also immortal, as long as we consume a rare breed of seagull chick once every 500 years. As it so happens, our time of need is near. We ask that you travel to the Island of Gulls and get a chick for each of us. There is but one tree on the island, and the nests are in that tree.”

The man followed the dolphins in his boat to the island, and he dropped anchor waded ashore. He could see the tree from the beach, and began his trek through the underbrush toward it. He froze in his tracks, however, when he saw the base of the tree was guarded by huge lions! Blessedly, they were fast asleep. Being a man of his word, the fisherman tiptoed bravely around the lions and climbed the tree. He snatched two of the odd, blue-colored chicks and stuffed one in each coat pocket. He then climbed down, crept back past the lions, fought his way back through the bushes, and was just within sight of his boat... when he was stopped by a policeman in full uniform.
“You’re under arrest, sir. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will-“
“Hold up, officer!” The man interjected, “What are the charges? What crime could I possibly have committed?”
“Sir,” the officer replied, reading his clipboard, “you are under arrest for transporting young gulls across sedate lions for immortal porpoises.”","A fisherman took his boat far out to sea. He hooked a huge fish, and fought it for hours.",187

post,ai1td2,2qh72,jokes,false,1548015404,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ai1td2/trying_to_rope_a_deer/,self.jokes,,"Written by someone who wants to remain anonymous. 

I copies the text, if not allowed, please remove. But I thought it was pretty funny so I wanted to share. 

It's loooong but SO worth the read!

Actual letter from someone who farms and writes well!  


I had this idea that I was going to rope a deer, put it in  
a stall, feed it up on corn for a couple of weeks, then kill it and eat it.  


The first step in this adventure was getting a deer. I figured  
that, since they congregate at my cattle feeder and do not seem to have much fear  
of me when we are there (a bold one will sometimes come right up and sniff at the  
bags of feed while I am in the back of the truck not 4 feet away), it should not  
be difficult to rope one, get up to it and toss a bag over its head (to calm it  
down) then hog tie it and transport it home.  


I filled the cattle feeder then hid down at the end with  
my rope.  


The cattle, having seen the roping thing before, stayed well  
back. They were not having any of it.  


After about 20 minutes, my deer showed up -- 3 of them. I  
picked out.. ..a likely looking one, stepped out from the end of the feeder, and  
threw.. My rope. The deer just stood there and stared at me.  


I wrapped the rope around my waist and twisted the end so  
I would have a good hold. The deer still just stood and stared at me, but you could  
tell it was mildly concerned about the whole rope situation.  


I took a step towards it...it took a step away. I put a little  
tension on the rope and then received an education.  


The first thing that I learned is that, while a deer may  
just stand there looking at you funny while you rope it, they are spurred to action  
when you start pulling on that rope.  


That deer EXPLODED.  


The second thing I learned is that pound for pound, a deer  
is a LOT stronger than a cow or a colt. A cow or a colt in that weight range I could  
fight down with a rope and with some dignity.  


A deer-- no chance.  


That thing ran and bucked and twisted and pulled. There was  
no controlling it and certainly no getting close to it. As it jerked me off my feet  
and started dragging me across the ground, it occurred to me that having a deer  
on a rope was not nearly as good an idea as I had originally imagined.  


The only upside is that they do not have as much stamina  
as many other animals.  


A brief 10 minutes later, it was tired and not nearly as  
quick to jerk me off my feet and drag me when I managed to get up. It took me  
a few minutes to realize this, since I was mostly blinded by the blood flowing out  
of the big gash in my head. At that point, I had lost my taste for corn-fed  
venison. I just wanted to get that devil creature off the end of that rope.  


I figured if I just let it go with the rope hanging around  
its neck, it would likely die slow and painfully somewhere. At the time, there was  
no love at all between me and that deer. At that moment, I hated the thing,  
and I would venture a guess that the feeling was mutual.  


Despite the gash in my head and the several large knots where  
I had cleverly arrested the deer's momentum by bracing my head against various large  
rocks as it dragged me across the ground, I could still think clearly enough to  
recognize that there was a small chance that I shared some tiny amount of responsibility  
for the situation we were in, so I didn't want the deer to have to suffer a slow  
death, so I managed to get it lined back up in between my truck and the feeder -  
a little trap I had set before hand...kind of like a squeeze chute.  


I got it to back in there and I started moving up so I could  
get my rope back.  


Did you know that deer bite? They do! I never in a million  
years would have thought that a deer would bite somebody, so I was very surprised  
when I reached up there to grab that rope and the deer grabbed hold of my wrist.  


Now, when a deer bites you, it is not like being bit by a  
horse where they just bite you and then let go. A deer bites you and shakes  
its head --almost like a pit bull. They bite HARD and it hurts.  


The proper thing to do when a deer bites you is probably  
to freeze and draw back slowly. I tried screaming and shaking instead. My method  
was ineffective. It seems like the deer was biting and shaking for several minutes,  
but it was likely only several seconds.  


I, being smarter than a deer (though you may be questioning  
that claim by now), tricked it.  


While I kept it busy tearing the tendons out of my right  
arm, I reached up with my left hand and pulled that rope loose. That was when  
I got my final lesson in deer behavior for the day.  


Deer will strike at you with their front feet. They rear  
right up on their back feet and strike right about head and shoulder level, and  
their hooves are surprisingly sharp. I learned a long time ago that, when an animal  
\-- like a horse --strikes at you with their hooves and you can't get away easily,  
the best thing to do is try to make a loud noise and make an aggressive move towards  
the animal.  
This will usually cause them to back down a bit so you  
can escape.  


This was not a horse. This was a deer, so obviously, such  
trickery would not work. In the course of a millisecond, I devised a different  
strategy. I screamed like a woman and tried to turn and run.  


The reason I had always been told NOT to try to turn and  
run from a horse that paws at you is that there is a good chance that it will  
hit you in the back of the head. Deer may not be so different from horses after  
all, besides being twice as strong and 3 times as evil, because the second  
I turned to run, it hit me right in the back of the head and knocked me down.  


Now, when a deer paws at you and knocks you down, it does  
not immediately leave. I suspect it does not recognize that the danger  
has passed. What they do instead is paw your back and jump up and down on you  
while you are laying there crying like a little girl and covering your head.  


I finally managed to crawl under the truck and the deer went  
away.  


So now I know why when people go deer hunting they bring  
a rifle with a scope to sort of even the odds.",trying to rope a deer,5

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad.

She's pregnant.

Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true.

I'm over at Jason's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

With $1000 he could buy an entire fleet with 50 men per ship. He'd be the most feared Pirate in the Atlantic! 

After 2 days of fighting by sea and shore, Captain Flint and the crew of the Obsidian Pearl successfully kill every last member of the Filthy Five Hundred. However, only Captain Flint survives... His entire crew, wiped out from Canon fire and brutal melee battle. His ship... A sunken wreck. 

With his last few coins, The Captain charters a local fishing boat to take him (and 500 heads) back to the Bahamas and collect his reward. 

During the voyage back, they run into a storm of the likes never been seen before by the Captain.

Deep in the torrential seas, a bolt of lightning explodes into the hull. Quickly the Captain gathers his haul of heads into a large fishing net and ties the end. The captain holds onto them for dear life as another lightning bolt strikes the boat.

The captain wakes up, floating on top of his giant haul of heads, bobbing up and down on the now calm ocean. 

Having lost everything he owns, The Captain knows that if he doesn't bring these heads back he might as well die out here. He starts to paddle, using the massive head sack as a float.

Kicking his legs, he goes west, heading away from the sunrise.

Four days he paddles, pushing the giant haul towards the coast line. Just as he feels about ready to drop dead, he floats into the harbour of his home town. 

Dripping wet and plagued with fatigue, The Captain drags the 500 heads straight to the Governor, eager to collect on the bounty. 

The Governor is very pleased! He immediately hands over One Pirate to Captain Flint.

Confused, the Captain says, ""Aye... and the $1000?""

When the stake caught his eye (despite it being very basic and unattractive), he decided he wanted to own it. So, he waited for the old man to leave, and promptly pulled it out and carried it away to his submarine, where he found a nice spot for it inside.

Now, because the captain was not a very smart man, he always had a group of archers around him, covered head to toe in blue; blue garments, blue boots, a blue bow. Some of these archers, along with a couple of crew member, began to admire the stake, thanking the captain for the joy he had brought them. It wasn’t long, however, before the rest of submarine crew members found it and absolutely despised it!

The week after, the captain relayed this entire story to a guy he’d met in a bar, who was named James.

“Well, what happened next?” James asked, as he was completely hooked on the story.

The captain had a swig of ale, before grinning and replying, “When the crew found out the post was stolen and low effort, they bombarded it with blue arrows until it was removed from the sub!” After that, the captain began to extend his arms and legs in a practiced manner.

Once the captain saw James’ perplexed look, he sighed and said, “I know, I’m really stretching with that one.”","One day, an old man was hammering a large, wooden stake into his garden.",7

Confused and hungry, the man approached the employee and asked, “Where’s the lunchline?”",A man walks into a resort and the first sign he sees says “Lool Area”. He was confused and asked one of the employees about it.,5408

&amp;#x200B;

He then asks the bartender what tha jar is all about, to which he replies with, ""Oh, the jar is part of a challenge I decided to set up for the patrons of the bar. Winner takes all""

&amp;#x200B;

The guy then replies, ""Alrigh, Ill bite. What are the challenges?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Hold on, buck-o. You gotta put money in the jar first.""

&amp;#x200B;

He then puts a twenty in the jar.

&amp;#x200B;

The bartender leans in and tells him, ""Alright, heres the deal. This is a three-part challenge. For the first part of the challenge, you have to down an entire bottle of peppered tequila as fast as you can.""

&amp;#x200B;

""For the second one, you have to go out back where we have a rabid pitbull with a sore tooth. Your job is to remove his tooth with your bare hands.""

&amp;#x200B;

""As for the third part, you will have to go to the second floor of this establishment and enter the room on the left. There, you will find a 73 year old woman who has never had an orgasm in her life. Im sure you know what Im going to tell you what your job is.""

&amp;#x200B;

After hearing this, the guy replies with, ""Shit, man, that sounds tough.""

&amp;#x200B;

The bartender replies with, ""Sorry bud, you already paid.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Alright, I am in. Just give me some time to get plastered.""

&amp;#x200B;

The guy downed about 15 shots before he said to the bartender, ""Alright, bub, hand over the tequila.""

&amp;#x200B;

Once in his hands, he proceeded to chug the entire thing. Dude didnt make a face afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

""Wheres that damn dog?"", said the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

The bartender pointed to the door all the way to the back of the building, to which the guy stumbled his way towards it.

&amp;#x200B;

Once there, he went through the door and closed it behind him.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of seconds later, everyone at the bar could hear both the guy and the dog tussling in the back, causing a lot of noise. You could hear the dog, yelping for help and the guy grunting loudly.

 

About twenty minutes later, there was a final loud yelp, which people didnt know if it came from the dog or the guy), and everything went silent.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone thought that the guy had been mauled to death, and silence plagued the bar, until, finally, the guy emerged from the door, his clothes ripped to shreds.

&amp;#x200B;

Gasping, he then said, ""Now, tell me where I can find the lady with the sore tooth.""",So this guy walks into a bar...,34

Too the grievance of his mother he moved a few states over. To a little mining village that like in the old days completely depended on their local gold mine. For some reason unlike all the other mining towns this one had survived the goldrush.

On his first day there he went into the saloon - yes it was a real old mining town with an old fashioned saloon. He took his place at the bar and ordered a beer. His first legal alcoholic beverage. The bartender pours him a nice stout draft and slides it over the bar and it stops perfectly in front of him. To show all the other miners he's a tough cookie he downs the beer in one gulp.

“Ahhh. That does hit the spot. What do I get you for this nice ale”

“Nothing my friend.” The bartender responds
“I just ask you to send kindness my way whenever you have some to spare”

Brian thinking that this is a great way to begin his time here and leaves for his hotel. There he talks to the proprietor to arrange his long term stay. But the proprietor as well as the bartender wanted none of his money.

“No lad. I give it out of the kindness of my heart and hope that it eventually be returned”.

With a big grin he walks of towards the mine. Ready to start his first work day. The overseer explains to him that like all the first timers he will start by replacing the vertical support beams.

Brian loads up his wagon with beams and sets off to start replacing. The overseer tells him all beams need to be replaced from the opening of the mine to the end of the mine. Brian stops at the first beam and notices that this beam is almost brand new. But not knowing anything of mining he thinks nothing of it and proceeds to replace the beam with some slight difficulty.

So this goes on for a whole week. He gets better and better at fitting the new beams. Drinks and eats to his fill. Tries to persuade the bartender as well as the proprietor to take his money to no avail. 

At the end of the week he guesses he almost refitted a 10th of the whole mine. He goes over to the overseer for his pay.

“Lad you have done a fine job for a first timer. Here I have a fat envelop for you. I thank you a many”

Brian takes his envelope with a big grin and asks when he will get to the actual mining.

“Just keep refitting those beams for now”

Slightly disgruntled Brian opens his envelop. To his further annoyance his envelope contains a bunch of ‘thank you cards’. No money.

“What the hell is this! Where is my pay!” Brian exclaims.

The overseer sighs and takes Brian aside.

“I know you're new here. So let me explain it to you. Keep at reposting, collect your karma and you will mine gold eventually”",Brian wanted to be a miner ever since he was little,12

Robin, being the glutton he was, started with some caviar and ordered a Hereford beef sirloin steak. Batman wasn't feeling well, so he only wanted a glass of water without ice.

After a few minutes in silence, Robin wanted to break the tension.

""Hey, are you feeling alright Batty?""

Batman sighed heavily. ""I don't know, man. I guess I just don't understand why we have to go out every day to stop crime while the police sit back and take all the credit for it. If we just left, the corruption would leave town eventually. Maybe we could make the city safer by letting the evil take it over.""

""That's crazy thinking!"" yelled Robin, although on the inside, he felt the same way. ""The police are part of the corruption here. We have to protect the citizens from their defenders.""

Batman took a second to think as the waitress arrived, speaking again once she left earshot.

""Maybe you're right. The corruption in this city starts at its core and the citizens can not protect themselves from it. Me and you have to get back out there and--"".

Suddenly Batman tensed up. Robin eyed him, cautiously. He knows how his multiple personalities can get. For years, Batman believed he was multiple people. First he was Lewis Wilson. That's who he really was inside. At least, that's who he was before his other voices took over. Soon after, he was claiming Val Kilmer and even George Clooney! Batman had truly gone insane, but Robin stood by his side, knowing that his friend was still inside there somewhere. Ever since Christian Bale joined the group, Batman has been calling himself ""the Dark Knight"", and speaking in a dark, raspy voice. When his DID triggers, he becomes completely engulfed by Christian Bale.

This has happened many times before and Robin already knew what was bothering him. ""Hey buddy, it's okay, we'll find Rachael eventually.""

""No, that's not it,"" Batman said.

Robin was shocked. He was speaking in his normal voice! Something else was bothering him, and it was clearly very serious.

""What happened? Did the Joker escape? Did we forget about a bad guy? Did the courts let a criminal escape again?"" Robin was frantically looking for an answer.

""No Robin, don't worry,"" Batman said, holding up his glass.

""Just ice was served.""",Batman and Robin are at a restaurant,7
