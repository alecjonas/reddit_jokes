One evening there were three guys working the night shift at the spice factory. Two of them were close friends and would often waste time and talk for hours. One of their favorite conversations was on the lowly lot of the neighboring hogs and how it was inhumane to keep them there. Their problem was that the third worker did not share their views and had no problems with the hog farm and in fact loved pork related products. They wanted everything to release the hogs back into the wild. One night these two were on a gangplank above mounds of different spices planning the great pig escape/rescue when the other worker appeared out of nowhere having overheard everything. He shouts, 'I heard what you are going to do! I am going to tell everyone!' One of the conspiring workers jolts into action and pushes him over the edge and into a spice mound below, killing him. The other guy says 'Why did you do that!?!' The first replies, ""A snitch in thyme saves swine""",A long time ago In the old country there was a spice factory....,0

Back 150+ years ago, presidental candidates didn't have nearly the luxuries current candidates do. The didn't stay in five star hotels or travel by private jet - they stayed with normal families on their campaigns and in exchange for a place to stay, would do chores around the property before they headed to a new city. 

In 1860 Abraham Lincoln actually stayed with my great great great grandma. She was a pretty bossy lady and gave Lincoln a long list of chores to do as soon as she met him. Finally when he thought he was done, my grandma said ""Last chores Abraham. For dinner we're having stew, corn on the cob, and apple pie. I'll work on the stew, but you're going to be on the front porch shucking corn and peeling apples until there's nothing left in front of you."" And with that, she led him outside where there were two huge baskets filled to the brim with apples and corn. 

Abraham started peeling and shucking. Periodically my grandma would check on him to see how much he had left to get an idea of when they'd eat. Little known fact about Abraham Lincoln, but he is very bad at shucking corn and peeling apples. 

After checking on him for what felt like the tenth time, my grandma was real frustrated. She said ""Abraham, how the hell can you be expected to lead a country if you can't even help with dinner!?"" 

And Abraham Lincoln replied, ""relax Mrs. Lee, I have four cores and seven ears to go.""



My dad CLAIMS he invented this. He has lots of others like it with similar punchlines where he rewords common sayings - 'brass is always cleaner on the other slide,' etc.

I love this joke, and I feel like this is a great place to put it. I ALWAYS get someone with this joke. The story can be a variation, but the punch line has to be a certain way.  PROTIP: tell the joke in a group, the sucker will never live it down.


**Joke**


These two gay guys meet up for their weekly game of ""guess what's in my ass."" They head to the hotel room, strip down, lube up, and get down to business. The first guy suggests his buddy go first, he agrees, bends over and closes his eyes. The first guy gets a lamp and sticks it bulb-first in his buddies ass. WOAH, says the second guy...that's a lamp. Correct, my turn says the first guy, who bends over and closes his eyes. The second guy shoves a broom-handle in the first guys ass. DAMN, says the first guy, that's a broom-handle. Correct says the second guy who exclaims, ""my turn!"" He bends over and closes his eyes.


**important part**


The first guy proceeds to ream his buddy with...uh...with uh...


**the joke teller should make up and down motions (like unclogging a toilet) and mumble about a ""toilet thingy""**


If you've done this correctly, your sucker should correct you and say, ""toilet plunger"" to which you reply.


**punchline**


""Ah, I see you've played this game before.""


Enjoy your newfound popularity as your sucker gets red-faced and tries to talk their way out of it.

""Wow!"" said the new missionary. ""And how is spreading the Word going?""

""Not too bad,"" said the old missionary. ""I'd say we've converted about half.""

The new missionary was amazed and impressed. He bid the old missionary farewell, and began his walk up to his new church to begin his work.

Suddenly he sensed he was being stalked; sure enough, right behind him was an enormous lion. The new missionary saw nowhere to run, so instead looked to his faith; he dropped to his knees, clasped his hands together and prayed:

""Dear Lord,"" prayed the new missionary, ""Please let this lion be one of the devout Christian animals my colleague told me about!""

Abruptly, the lion stopped, just inches from the missionary. As the man watched in amazement, the lion reared back and put himself in a remarkable approximation of being on his knees. Then the lion put his two paws together and looked to the heavens. He was praying!

Despite all this travel, he, of course, never drives. He always has a different chauffeur to take him wherever he is going who always meet him at the airport and take him wherever he wants to go. The Pope misses driving, so one day he asks his driver, ""Do you mind if I drive, just this once? I haven't driven ever since becoming pope.""

Now, the chauffeur was a very pious man and didn't want to offend the Pope, but doesn't want to get in trouble with his boss. Eventually he decides that that it was a quick drive and that no one would know, so he agrees. 

They both get in the car with the Pope in the driver's seat, but as soon as the car got out of the parking lot, the Pope started speeding, cutting people off, running red lights and stop signs, just driving terribly in general. The chauffeur is panicking. He would lose his job, surely. And yet, he doesn't say a thing, being too afraid to offend the Pope. 

Sure enough, they get pulled over. As the cop walks up to the car, the chauffeur nearly faints. However, he takes one look in the window and turns right around and phones base. 

""Sir, I've got a problem here. I've just pulled someone ever that is very important. I don't think I can book him.""

The chief responds, ""Too important? Impossible. Who is it, some celebrity?""

""More important sir.""

""The mayor, then.""

""Even more important.""

""Governor?""

""More important, sir.""

""The president?""

""Even more important.""

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars!
 
Jerry said, “We've got to give it back.”
 
Sally said, “Finders keepers.” She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.
 
The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?
 
Sally said, “No.”
 
Jerry said, “She’s lying. She hid it up in the attic.”
 
Sally said, “Don't believe him, he’s getting senile.”
 
The agents turned to Jerry and began to question him.

I came downstairs and I decided to have a banana for breakfast, just a banana, keeping it simple. And I was looking at this banana lying there in front of me when some rage started to come over me. I started laying into the banana - verbally not physically, I’m not aggressive in that way, I always talk before I hit - and I really tore it off a strip, articulate, you know, calling it shorty and ugly and things like that. Incidentally, something you should know about bananas is that they are very placid, either that or they have long memories. Anyway after five minutes I felt I’d said enough and before it could think of a come-back I ate it in two gulps. 
So feeling pleased with myself and in a funny way virile, I packed my good tie and went off to work. After lunch my boss comes up to me and totally lays into me, telling me my work output is well below par and that he thinks I’m short and ugly, the latter of which I personally felt was unreasonable. Now, before you ask how the court case is going let me tell you that kind of negativity and put-down was not unusual. Me and my boss we had issues, along the lines of Putin and Poroshenko, and I figured today he was just ball-aching about some lost investors. Also, you know, I have background information on him. Nevertheless I was smarting by the end of the day. 
The next morning I woke up with the same feelings of malice and I start to think that maybe I’m just not a morning person. Again the banana gets it, both barrels and I’m calling out, ‘Anybody in there? Eh? Come on out!’ And again just after lunch I get it from my boss, both barrels, almost word for word. This went on two weeks. 
Finally I figured: voodoo, you know, that I was caught up in some weird gris-gris and that I was experiencing everything the banana did, right up until I ate it. So, the next day I was deliberately nice to the banana, calling it sweet, funny and smart and most of all purposeful and I thought by doing this maybe I’d get back the same sorts of compliments and in the long run my life would be immeasurably enriched. I get into work and all is good, everything’s going real well and I think I’ve nailed it right up until after lunch when my boss gives me another torrent of abuse and punches me in the mouth. There and then I handed in my notice and now the joke is on him because I won for constructive dismissal.",Fruits of Labour (It's all in the delivery),0

That night, he goes to his girlfriend's parents' house for dinner. Before they make the door, she tells him to remember one thing: ""Don't talk at the dinner table. The first person to talk at the dinner table has to do the dishes.""
""That's no problem,"" the man says. ""I'm happy to do the dishes."" His girlfriend shoots him a foreboding look.

He doesn't have much luck, until one  day, he comes across a Harley with a  'for sale' sign on it.

The bike looks better than a new one,  although it is 10 years old.  It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he  kept it in such great condition for 10  years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the  seller, 'whenever the bike is  outside and it's gonna rain, rub  Vaseline on the chrome.
It protects it from the rain, and he  hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.
  
That night, his girlfriend, Sandra,   invites him over to meet her parents.   Naturally, they take the bike there.
  
Just before they enter the house,   Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to   tell you something about my family.
  
'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.
  
In fact, the FIRST person who says   anything during dinner has to do the   dishes.'
  
'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.   Joe is shocked.  
Right in the middle of the living room   is a huge stack of dirty dishes.
  
In the kitchen is another huge stack of   dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the   corridor, everywhere he looks.

Dirty dishes.
  
They sit down to dinner, and sure   enough, no one says a word.
  
As dinner progresses, Joe decides to   take advantage of the situation.
  
He leans over and kisses Sandra.
  
No one says a word.
  
He reaches over and fondles her  breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her   clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of   her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her  dad is obviously livid and her mom   horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too. 

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the   table, pulls down her panties, and   screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.
  
She has a huge orgasm, &amp; Joe sits   down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is   boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to   ear. But still....Total silence.
  
All of a sudden there is a loud clap of   thunder, and it starts to rain.
  
Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls   the Large jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.

The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, ""These damn girls nights out have got to stop. 

My wife came home last night without her panties."" ""That's nothing,"" said the other.

He presented the first detective with a picture of a suspect and asked the detective what he sees:  
""Hmm.. "" the detective squints ""I can tell you that this man is a criminal and I would catch him on no time at all!"". The detective is impressed by this confident response and asks him "" how do you figure?""  
""Oh man, it's hard to miss a man with one eye!""  
""You moron! This is a side-on photograph!""

Thinking it could only get better, the chief officer invited the next detective in and presented him with the same picture and asked him what he sees.  
""It's clear as day! I see a criminal that will be easy to catch!""  
""How so?""  
""Well how hard is it to miss a man with one ear?""  
""You idiot! This isn't a full face picture!""

At this point the chief officer was feeling discouraged but since he only had one more to go he decided to give the next detective a shit. He presented him with the same photograph and hoped it wouldn't be another waste of time. ""What do you see?""  
""Mate, I couldn't be more sure that this criminal would be as easy to catch as a sloth in an enclosure!""  
""Right... How so?""  
""Listen chief, the criminal obviously wears a monocle!""  
""How would you infer that?"" Asked the not intrigued chief officer  
""Well! A person with one eye and one ear couldn't possibly wear a pair of glasses!""

It's keeping him up every night and leaving him in tears during the day. The doc runs some tests and breaks the bad news,
""Well Mr Smith, we've found the source of your problem. You see, your testicles are pressing against the base of your spine and that pressure on your spinal column is what is causing your back pain. The only solution is to chop off your testicles"". Mr Smith was obviously distraught but he couldn't face another day of agony so he decides to go through with the procedure.
A few weeks later, Mr Smith, still feeling awful about his new ball-less life walks by a tailor and decides to treat himself to a new suit. He walks into the tailor and demands the finest suit that money can buy - no expense spared.
The tailor looks him up and down, pauses for a second and says ""Not a problem I'd say you're a 40 long, 16 collar and a 34 chest""
""Incredible! How did you know?"" said Mr Smith
""I've been doing this a long time, it's my job to know these things"" replied the tailor and he scuttled away to fetch the items
Upon returning the tailor looks at Mr Smith again and says ""I'm guessing you're a size 10 shoe and a 34 waist. Oui?""
""Ha!"" replied Mr Smith, ""Got you this time! I'm actually a 32 waist, have been most of my life""

When he was growing up his room was covered in them. He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases, not to mention all of the tractor toys he would lovingly play with every day. 

On Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride on a tractor. Timmy was excited that his dream of riding on a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven around, the farmer offered Timmy a quick go behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove around the field he started to become more and more confident, when suddenly, disaster struck. Timmy, now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out from the pain. 

Timmy awoke a week later in his local hospital; both of his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life. 

Throughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor. 

We now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. ""Beautiful lady why are you crying"" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. ""Never fear"" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar; everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry ""how on earth did you do that?!"" ""It's easy,"" Timmy replied ""I'm an ex tractor fan.""",A Little Tale of Timmy (x-post from /r/long_jokes),4

“Do you know Patty O’Furniture”?

Or slightly more complex

“Do you know Arthur?”

“Arthur who?”

“Arthurmometer!”

Hilarity would ensue. This style of joke was nicknamed ” nifties “.

See the mother is a very doting mum, who while having raised her son right, would try to make life easier for her son if she could. So she decided to pick up swimming.

Eventually, the Question came up again and this time, confident in his mother's ability to swim, retorted at his wife,

""Ha! If both you and my mum fell into the ocean, i won't have to lift a finger as mum is now a certified lifesaver, *she*, will save, *you*!""

Unsatisfied, the wife complained,

""No! Thats not satisfactory, **YOU** have to jump into the water!""

So the man shot back,

""Well then too bad for you, as you will have to die. I don't know how to swim either and my mum would most definitely save me!""

A young priest was very nervous before his first Mass, so he asked the bishop what to do.
He advised him to drink a glass of water just before the Mass, in which he should put two drops of vodka for relaxation. The young priest drank the water with vodka, relaxed and had his first Mass. After the Mass there was a message from the Bishop waiting for him:

Dear pastor, I advised you two drops of vodka in a glass of water and not vice versa. Just so you know for the next time, it would be good if you take into account a few of my suggestions so the awkwardness from todays Mass doesn't reoccur:

1. There is no need to put a piece of lemon on the edge of the chalice.
2. The cupboard beside the altar is a confessional and not the toilet.
3. Do not lean on the statue of the Virgin Mary, nor Embrace or kiss it.
4. There are Ten Commandments and not twelve.
5. There are twelve Apostles and not seven, and none of them is a dwarf.
6. Jesus and his disciples are not called J. C. &amp; Company.
7. David defeated Goliath with a slingshot and a stone, not by fucking him up and smashing his brain.
8. Judas is not called son of a bitch.
9. The Pope can't be called El Padrino.
10. Osama Bin Laden had nothing to do with Jesus' crucifixion.
11. Blessed water is intended solely and only for blessing and not to refresh your armpits.
12. When you pray, do not sit in front of the altar, and do not place your legs on the Bible.
13. Sacramental bread is not a snack that goes with wine, but is intended for believers.
14. Sinners go to hell and not go fuck themselves.
15. Invitation to a dance generally isn't a bad idea, but a wild polka through the church, however, is inappropriate.
16. That person in the pink dress next to the Choir, you called gay and a transvestite, that was me.",Young priest before his first moss,2

Therefore, the new government found itself bankrupt.  Among other services that it could not afford to continue to provide was the operation of several large laughing academies.

The chief psychiatrists for the various institutes of mental health met in conference with the new president and, after much anguished consideration, it was decided in the interests of public safety that the incurable inmates could not simply be turned out onto the streets.  Instead, it was decided that they would be put onto a large isolated jungle island in the river to fend for themselves.

This volcanic island had been a long-term wildlife preserve for the nation's endangered species.  On the island lived various rare species of monkeys and parrots and one example of a particularly rare species of sloth.

When the day arrived for the new colony of former mental health patients to be established, they were ferried in small groups to the island.  As they came ashore, the new arrivals began exploring the island.  They soon discovered the magnificent rare sloth in a huge tree, suspended from his favorite limb above the steaming water of a volcanic pool.

As more and more of the new colonists arrived, they flocked to the tree to stare and gibber in fascination at the sloth.  The sloth, therefore, became as agitated as a sloth could get and crept further out along his tree limb.  As the crowd grew, the sloth crept out further and further until the limb finally snapped and he fell to his death into the bubbling water of the steaming pool below.

This is, of course, but another proof that too many kooks boil the sloth.

The local elves union was up in arms over their contract and were threatening a walk-out. Mrs. Clause was pissed that Santa was never around to appreciate all of the hard work she had been doing around the house. Santa decided he needed to go home, sit in front of a fire and relax.

When he got there, Miss Clause was all up in his face and wouldn't let down. Then, there was a knock on the door. It was Rudolph. He said the reindeer were sick and tired of Santa not upgrading to the new lightweight sliegh and they were joining the elves walkout. Santa slammed the door and threatend ""The next person who knocks on that door is gonna get it!""

At that time, there was a knock on the door. Santa flung the door open and there stood a tiny little angel. The angel had been searching for the perfect Christmas tree for Santa's house all day long, until it found the perfect one. The little angel asked, ""Santa, I was wondering where you would like me to stick this tree?""

He killed the first 50 with his machine gun, the next 30 with his machete, and the last 20 in hand to hand combat""

Bit of background first: I am from a country where English is not the native language. Having said that, since we were colonized by the British close to 150 years people feel inferior if they don’t speak in English, especially in posh public places. One such place is the British Council where people come to use the Library and attend English classes held there.

One fine day I happened to be browsing some magazines in the library when one of my friends came to me and requested help on what he should say in order to talk to the lady at the reception. I basically told him to first say “Good morning, madam can you help me in finding some information on blah blah blah”

If you go out and work for a year, I’ll upgrade you to a Honey Nut Cheerio.” The Cheerio thinks on it, and quickly agrees. He goes out, works as hard as he can for a year, and comes back to his boss very satisfied with his work. His boss happily upgrades him to a Honey Nut Cheerio, but upon tasting himself, the Cheerio thinks he still has a lot of room for improvement.

-

The Cheerio says “Boss, I appreciate what you’ve done for me, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I think I could still be tastier.” The boss smiles widely, and claps his hands together. “I like your attitude, young man. I tell you what, if you go out and work for two more years, I’ll upgrade you to an Apple Jack.” The Cheerio happily agrees, and speeds out of his boss’s office to get to work. He works hard for two more years, and makes the trip back into his boss’s office. Again, upon receiving the promotion, the Cheerio tastes himself and still thinks he can be better.

-

“Boss,” he says, “I really can’t thank you enough, but I still think I can taste better.” The boss furrows his brow and looks deep into the Cheerio’s eyes. “You’re a real go-getter, boy. If you go out and work for three years, I’ll upgrade you to a Captain Crunch Crunch Berry.” The Cheerio nods his head, and storms out to get back to work. He works hard, harder than he ever has, for those three years, and comes back to his boss for the promotion. He tastes himself again, and is still unimpressed.

-

“Before you say anything,” the Boss interjects, “I’ll assume you’re still not satisfied. I want to extend the opportunity to upgrade to a Lucky Charms Marshmallow, but only if you go out and work for four more years.” The Cheerio goes home, thinks about his boss’s proposal, and comes back the next day ready to accept. He goes and works diligently for four years, and when he comes back he can definitely taste the difference. The strolls into his boss’s office proudly and sits down. “Boss, I taste amazing. I mean seriously, I might be the tastiest cereal ever. Thank you.” 

-

The boss laughs. “Not quite, son. If you want, you can go out to work for five years and become a Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But if you do, you’ll never be able to become a Reese’s Puff.” The Cheerio wracks his brain for a decision taking weeks to weigh the two options, and eventually concludes that no matter what he has to give up, he wants to become a Cinnamon Toast Crunch. He goes out and dedicates five years of his life to becoming a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and when he comes back into his boss’s office, he is almost unbearably delicious.

-

“Boss, I’ve hit the pinnacle of tastiness. I doubt that in all my years of life, I’ve ever tasted anything so good, and doubt I’ll ever taste anything better.” The boss slowly shakes his head, smiling. “Listen. Only one cereal on Earth has done what I’m about to suggest, but I think you have the chops to make it a reality. If you go out and work for ten years, I can almost guarantee you to become a Honeycomb.” Picking his jaw up off the ground, the Cheerio happily and eagerly accepts. He goes out and works. For ten years, sleeping very little, eating even less, ignoring friends, family, and any other obligation, he does nothing but work for ten long years, and the Cheerio staggers back into his boss’s office successful. His boss upgrades him to a Honeycomb, and those ten years of hard labor instantly becomes more than worth it. 

-

His boss is floored. “Son, I had my doubts about you, but now there’s nothing more I can give you. Well done.” The Cheerio, feeling like the tastiest thing in the universe, proudly leaves his boss’s office and goes into the open world. However, working for twenty-five years made the Cheerio incredibly thirsty, so he makes the trip to the most popular store in town, the milk store. The line stretches out of the door and around the corner, so the Cheerio decides to drink something else. He goes to the water store, and though the line is definitely shorter, there’s still a hundred people waiting in front of him. He figures he could probably go somewhere else before the line clears, so he decides to go to the punch store. One he arrives, he remembers that he hates punch, but he isn’t going to go anywhere else because there’s no punch line.",A cheerio walks into his boss's office...,19

By sheer force of will he dragged himself from his bed and out to the outhouse to do some paperwork. However, being as tired as he was, he fell asleep on the pot. 

The next morning his friends awoke early and noticed him missing. They searched the camp-sight and finally found him snoring on the toiled. They decided to prank their hapless friend by putting the Deer guts down the outhouse, the idea being to make several jokes on the way home about how he had taken such a colossal shit over the night that he pooped his guts out. That done they headed back to the cabin and waited.

15 minutes later they hear their friend runs into the cabin and says ""You guys will never believe it, Last night, I was so tired that I fell asleep on the can and pooped my guts out. But, thanks to my brute force, and this stick, I got them back in.""",A hunting story.,9

He sits down, says hello and tries to make small talk, but she just keeps disregarding him and telling him off. So the guy gives up and goes to sit in the front of the bus near the bus driver. The middle aged, male bus driver says ""Hey I saw what just happened. Don't beat yourself up over it, she takes this bus everyday, this happens to every guy who tries to talk to her. The guy says ""I wonder why?"" The bus driver responds ""Well, I know for a fact that she's super religious so that might have something to do with it. I also know that she goes to the cemetery every Tuesday night to pray to God. Some people have seen her there and heard her saying things like she wishes to be the mother of the next Christ."" The man says ""That seems a bit odd."" The bus driver replies ""True, but think about it, you could use this situation to your advantage. If you go to the cemetery dressed as the lord, you'll probably get lucky."" The man excitedly replies ""Yeah you're right, thanks!"" So when Tuesday night came around the guy dressed like Jesus, but with a hood on to hide his identity and went to the cemetery. Just as the bus driver said, he saw the woman dressed as a nun praying in front of a statue of Jesus. He hears her speak ""Please Lord, please, my only wish is to be the mother of the second coming of your son."" The guy takes advantage of the situation and responds to her. ""I have heard your prayers and have come to fulfill your wish.  Excitedly she says ""Oh thank you Lord! You have no idea how happy this makes me, but before we get started, I request that we have anal sex first."" The man, super happy about this agrees. He lifts up the gown and starts to have anal sex with her. 

As he finishes, he removes his hood and says ""Ha! I'm the guy from the bus."" They remove their hood, ""Ha! I'm the bus driver!""",Guy on a bus,1

Walking through a bazaar one day he found the solution to his dilemma: a sign which read, ""CAMELS GELDED WITHOUT PAIN."" Making inquires of the stall's proprietor, he was assured that the operation was quick and absolutely painless. There would be no suffering. A price was negotiated and the merchant returned the next day with his favorite camel in tow.

He went from school to school and tutor to tutor but no one could work with him.  He wasn't getting in to trouble or doing drugs he just wasn't to smart and couldn't find the motivation to get himself to work.

After going to just about every school in the city there was only one school left that would accept him.  It was a Catholic school.  The family wasn't religious but they knew the value of an education so they sen't him there anyways.

After the first day of school, the boy comes home with a very serious face and heads straight upstairs to his room.  His parents only thoughts were ""not again"", and left him be till dinner.  When his mother went to retrieve him she opened his door and saw that he was hard at work doing his homework. Something he had never done before.  Without saying anything about the homework they headed downstairs and ate dinner. 

Both the mother and father both had their doubts about how hard he would continue to work on his school work but sure enough day after day he would come home and do nothing but do his school work.  His parents were stunned but stayed to themselves and let their son work thinking surely the result will be the same.

After the first quarter of school and a lot of anticipation from the parents, the boy finally came home with his report card.  He walked in the door, set the report card on the table, and went straight up to his room.  His mother opened the report card and to their surprise he had straight A's and B's.  Shocked she had to go speak to her son.  She went up stairs into his room where he was back doing homework again.  
""Ok, I have to ask, are they beating you?""
""No"", he said as he kept focused on his homework.
""Is it the nuns?""
""No.""
""Well then, WHAT was it? The books? The uniforms? Are the other students teasing you? WHAT WAS IT?""
