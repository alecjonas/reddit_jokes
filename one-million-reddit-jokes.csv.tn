When he finishes, he comes back to the bar counter and orders 3 more. The bartender tells him, ""You know, beer goes flat after I fill it in the glass; it would taste better if you buy one at a time.""

The Irishman replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Dublin , the other in Canada and I'm here in London . When we left home, we promised that we'll drink this way to remember the days when we drank together.""

The bartender admits this is a nice custom and leaves it there.

The Irishman became a regular in the bar and would always drink the same way. He'd order 3 Beers and drink them in turn.

One day, he came in and ordered only 2 Beers. All the other regulars notice and fall silent.

When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bar tender says, ""I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my sincere condolences on your great loss.""

The Irishman looked confused for a moment, and then he laughs.... ""Oh, no,"" He said, ""Everyone's fine; both my brothers are alive. The only thing is . . . I have quit drinking""!",An Irishman walks into a bar in London,3

The manager tells them to let him know next time he makes a deposit. Surely enough, the next day, he comes with 1k in cash to deposit into his account. The tellers tell the man that the manager would like to see him. The manager, who sits in a giant glass office on the bank floor, welcomes the man and then asks him how he gets $1,000 to put in every day. The man tells him ""well, I make a lot of bets and that's where all the money is from."" The manager doesn't believe how he can make all that money just by betting, so the man says ""okay then, I bet you $1,000 I can bite my eye.""

""bullshit! That's impossible."" Says the manager, and places $1,000 on the table. 

The man takes out his glass eye, bites it, and takes the money. ""Okay, that's not fair to you. You didn't know I had a glass eye. I bet you double that I can bite my ear!"" The manager thinks that it's impossible and is desperate to make his money back. ""Deal.""

The man then takes out his dentures and bites his ear. The manager is embarrassed and upset he's lost all that money on a stupid bet. The man notices this and says ""Okay, you seem upset. I'll make it up to you fair and square. Tomorrow I'll come back and I bet you $5,000 I can guess what color underwear you're wearing.""

The manager thinks this over and sees that there's no way the man will be able to guess and agrees. He later goes shopping for the craziest, most colorful pair of underwear he can find. The next day, the man is back in the manager's office. The manager goes ""Alright then, try and guess what color I'm wearing. I'm more than certain that you'll never be able to.""

""White."" The man says.

The manager jumps up, takes the money, and yelps ""AHA! WRONG!"" and pulls down his pants to reveal rainbow colored underwear.

The man jumps up and yelps ""AHA! I WIN!""

The manager is confused and says ""what are you talking about? You guessed wrong and lost the bet.""

""Yeah, I lost that bet. But I also bet all your employees out there watching that I could get you to pull down your pants.""","A man deposits $1,000 cash into his bank account every day",2338

He's stopped by his grandfather, who rests comfortably on an old rocking chair... his usual morning leisure. The grandfather notices the duck tape... 

&amp;nbsp;

""Whatcha doin' with that duck tape, boy?""
The boy answers, ""Gonna catch me some ducks of course.""

He skips along and the old man chuckles himself back into his chair... ""That boy's a damn fool..."" he mutters, ""... a damn fool."" 

&amp;nbsp;

But low and behold, three hours later, the old man bites his words. The boy did return and under each arm were two, young ducklings. The old man is bewildered. ""Welp, you proved me wrong son! Shame on me to doubt my own grandson."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Next day, just before sunrise, same thing happens again. Little Johnny runs out of the house with a bundle of chicken wire.

&amp;nbsp;

""What do you have this time? Chicken wire?"" says the old man, ""You gonna catch some chickens?""
&amp;nbsp;
""I'm gonna try!"" says the boy. And he scurries along into the fields. 

&amp;nbsp;

Times goes on and dusk approaches. The old man gets worried as Little Johnny hasn't returned in many hours. Suddenly, through the fallows, he sees a dozen chickens running towards the house, followed by a twelve year old boy with a handful of chickens. ""That son of a bitch did it!"" says the old man. 

Well, on the last day... boy comes out of the house again with a brown paper bag filled with items unknown. 

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh boy, what do you have there now!"" 
""Pussywillow!"" says the boy.

He went through his grieving period and decided he wanted a new pet so he went to the pet store.

He Asked the pet store owner why it was so cheap and the owner stated the parrot had a ""slight"" cussing problem.

The preacher said that he would help the bird find god and be cured of his cussing problem and the pet store owner sold him to the preacher and said if it doesn't work just bring him back and we will think of something.

All week long the bird was just fine and the preacher never heard a cuss word one.  He took him to church on Sunday Morning and a few minutes into his sermon the bird cracked up saying ""DAMN its hot in here"" this happened a couple more times during the sermon and the pastor decided to talk to the bird when he was done.

He warned the bird and everything seemed fine but the next sunday the exact same thing happened.  This continued for a month or so with the bird doing the exact same thing.  Finally in a fit of rage he took him back to the pet store and talked with the owner.  

The owner suggested next time it happened SPIN the bottom of the birds cage as hard as he could and it might scare the bird into stopping.  Armed with this suggestion the preacher felt ready.

the following sunday the preacher got up and a few minutes into his sermon the bird said DAMN its hot in here ... preacher thought no better time than now and reached down and SPUN the cage hard, after the cage stopped spinning the bird dizzy as ever said ""WEEEEEEE feel that fucking breeze""

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Mbembe approached it very carefully.

He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.

As carefully and as gently as he could, Mbembe worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments.

Mbembe stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.

Mbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Mbembe was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son.

As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Mbembe and his son Tapu were standing.

The large bull elephant stared at Mbembe, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.

Mbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Mbembe' s legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. It wasn't the same elephant.",Elephants never forget,18

Upon hearing that the priest has a few hours off the fisherman invites him out to sea to fish with him.

Out at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, ""Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!""

Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, ""My son, please don't use such language.""

The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, ""Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch."" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete. 

The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off.

The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, ""Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!""

The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, ""Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?""

The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest. 

After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, ""Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.""

The maid blushes and responds, ""Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?""

The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish.

It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, ""Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?""

""I caught the son-of-a-bitch."" Said the priest.

""I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch."" Said the bishop.

""And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch."" Said the maid.

For a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed. He then slowly removed his hat, kicked off his sandles, put his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up on the table and said, ""You know what? You mother fuckers are alright!""",A Priest takes a walk down to the docks one day,4364

Why Parents Have Gray Hair

A father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed nicely made up and everything neat and tidy.

Then he saw an envelope propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, ""Dad"". With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:

Dear Dad,

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Mom.

I've been finding real passion with Joan and she is so nice. I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercings, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am but it's not only the passion, Dad, she's pregnant.

Joan says that we are going to be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood, enough for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Joan has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.
In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Joan can get better; she sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.

Your son, Chad

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Tommy's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the report card that's in my desk drawer.

I love you! Call when it is safe for me to come home! ",why parents have gray hair ..,33

And it came to pass, in the fullness of time, that the Shahnee gave birth to a son, and this son, being the heir to the Peacock Throne was given the title of Shan.

 It soon transpired that all was not well with the young Shan and wise men were summoned from all over the kingdom to the palace. They examined the Shan carefully; then they instructed the scribes to write out enormous bills,; then they informed the Shah and the Shahnee that their son, the Shan, heir to the Peacock Throne, was epileptic.

 Now in those days there was no Medicare or super-efficient public or private hospital system such as we enjoy in Australia today; there was not much that could be done about his condition. 

So the wise men got together, got their scribes to write out some more enormous bills and recommended to the Shah that he appoint some special bodyguards to take care of the Shan and watch over him all the time.

 And it was so. Everywhere the little Shan went, the bodyguard went, too, watching over him and taking care of him.

 For a while, all was well, but then, one day, when many months had passed without any untoward incident, the bodyguard grew complacent. The time came when he left the Shan alone while he indulged in amorous dalliance with one of the ladies of the court.

 And of course, it was at this time that the young Shan had an epileptic seizure and, being unattended injured himself.

 Great was the commotion in the Palace and the Shah waxed wroth. Summoning the bodyguard into his presence he angrily demanded, ""Where were you when the fit hit the Shan?""  ",Were you there?,18

Befor I found my first squirl. He ran off after I unfroze him and I didnt think I would see him again. After the first one I knew what to look for though and unfroze about 6-7 more.

Patient: ""Ddddd octttor. Whhaaat cccan I dddo?""

Patient: ""Doctor, the operation was a success. I have not stuttered since the operation. I have a great new job and my self esteem is fantastic. However, there is one problem My wife says that she sort of misses the great sex we used to have before the extra six inches were removed.

One day she spots a newcomer at BINGO. He's a dashing gentleman of about her age and though she's rather a prude she can't help but be flattered when he flirts a little with her. And though she's not sure that it's the godly thing to so, she's frankly thrilled when he returns the flirting in kind and by the time they have slurped up the last of the Jello at dinner, they're an item.

A few days later he asks her - since their together - if she would mind if he slept in her room. He promises not to take advantage of the situation. ""I've been alone for many years,"" he says, ""and I just want to be held by someone I care for."" Well she's not too sure about this, but she decides to give him a chance. ""No funny stuff?"" she asks - and he agrees.

Sure enough, they sleep that night in the same bed together and he never makes a move on her. She relaxes. Glad for the company and togetherness. He was right: being alone wasn't nearly as good as holding someone while you slept.

So they try it again a few days later. And a few days after that. Soon it's every day. Just sleeping together in the same bed, holding each other.

And then he misses a day.

Another.

Another.

He hardly comes around or pays attention to her.

She confronts him, ""Where have you been? I've been so lonely! Be honest with me, is it another woman?""

He must be honest. Eyes downcast, he admits that it is.

""But what does she have that I don't?""

""Well, you see, we have a tradition here..."" the bartender responds. ""You put $10 in the jar. If you can pass three trials, you win all the money.""

""And what are the challenges? The man asks, quite interested.

""Well first, ya gotta knock out our bouncer with one hit..."" the bartender gestures to a massive tank of a man standing at the door. ""Next ya gotta go out back. We got this mad dog with a bad tooth, and ya have to pull it out without losing any fingers. Last, ya gotta fuck Mary over there until she cums"" he concludes, gesturing to absolutely ancient woman sitting in the corner.

The man shrugs. ""Well, that certainly doesn't  seem like the thing for me,"" he says, drinking his beer. As the night goes on, the alcohol starts to build up his courage. After a few rounds, he silently gets up and puts $10 in the jar. Everyone watches as he sneaks up behind the bouncer, rears back, and delivers a quick punch to the back of the man's skull. The bouncer falls to the floor with a tremendous crash.

The crowd goes silent, amazed by the sight, before erupting into cheers as the man goes to finish his beer with one long chug. He stumbles a bit before looking around. ""Alright, what's next?!"" he shouts. They show him to a bolted door in the back. With a laugh, two men throw him into the pen with the dog and slam the wooden door shut.

There is a great struggle, loud barks, a few whimpers, and then silence.

Expecting to see a bloody mess, the crowd is surprised as they find the man totally unharmed and stumbling. He looks to the crowd and smiles.

""Patrick Henry, 1775."" 

""Very good! Who said ""Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"" ""?

She heard a loud whisper: ""Screw the Mexicans."" 

""Who said that?"" she demanded. 

Pedro put his hand up. ""Jim Bowie, 1836."" 

At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke."" 

The teacher glared and asked, ""All right! Now, who said that?"" 

Again, Pedro. ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991."" 

Now furious, another student yelled, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!"" 

Pedro jumped out of his chair waving his hand and shouting to the teacher, ""Bill Clinton to Monica Lewinski, 1997!"" 

Now, with almost a mob hysteria, someone said, ""You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you."" 

Pedro frantically yelled at the top of his voice, ""Gary Condit to Chandra Levy, 2001.""

As Dr. House boldly follows the stretcher and slaps on his gloves, he asks the man's spouse if there was anything else unusual going on. She claims that he had a large red rash, he had been complaining of fatigue and joint pain for several weeks, and there had more recently been blood in his urine. After the man's condition is stabilized, House assembles his army of toadies to figure out just what the heck was going on. He writes the symptoms on his whiteboard in his characteristic chicken scratch, and then asks, ""what have we got?"" Dr. Chase, being his eager little beaver self, suggested Sarcoidosis, like he always does. House smacks him firmly with his cane, and insults him for being Australian. ""Maybe you should go shoot some dingos for a living since you can't practice medicine competently"", House scolds. Having been shot down, Chase goes and sits down in his chair, and mulls over the options. Dr. Cameron pipes up next, and since she believes she is that smartest of the three underlings, she has great confidence in her answer, ""I believe it's kidney failure, since there's blood in his urine."" House gives her a scathing, condescending stare. He snaps at her that even if it were kidney failure, it was *obviously* a symptom, not a cause. He bickers about how she always misses the bigger picture and that she's pissing away her potential. Being reluctant to speak up due to his suggestion, Dr. Foreman figures House will pry it out of him eventually. He decides to just say screw it, and go balls deep.

post,4f1znw,2qh72,jokes,false,1460815053,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4f1znw/green_garden_grass_snake/,self.jokes,,"A couple in Sweetwater, Texas, had a lot of potted plants. During a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.
 
It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants.When it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa.
 
She let out a very loud scream.
 
The husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was.She told him there was a snake under the sofa.
 
He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind.He thought the snake had bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.
 
His wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to lie still and called an ambulance.
 
The attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the stretcher, and started carrying him out.
 
About that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher.That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.
 
The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor who volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.
 
But while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around.She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa.
 
The neighbor man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use CPR to revive her.
 
The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.
 
The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had bitten him. She went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.
 
By now, the police had arrived.
 
Breathe here...
 
They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred.They were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!
 
The police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.
 
Now, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it.He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table.The table fell over, the lamp on it shattered and, as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.
 
The other policeman tried to beat out the flames, and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into the street,where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car.
 
Meanwhile, neighbors saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department.The firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the street.The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get the house fire out).
 
Time passed. Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world.
 
A while later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night.The wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in their plants for the night.
 
And that's when he shot her.",Green garden grass snake,7

Once he gets to work, he sees his colleague at her desk and says to her ""So I saw my ex on the train on my way over..."" and before he can finish, his colleague abruptly stops typing and asks him: ""What was she doing? What was she wearing? Where was she going? Tell me!"" 

He's quite taken aback, but he obliges her the details.

After doing some work, he meets his friend for lunch and brings up the issue while they were eating. His friend drops his knife and fork and immediately begins questioning him: ""How did she look? Was she doing anything? Which station did she get off at?"" 

He's confused, but he tells his friend what he wants to know. 

After work, he heads home and sees his roommate watching television, and wonders if his roommate will react similarly. So he casually mentions ""So I ran into my ex on the way to work..."" and without missing a beat, his roommate picks up the remote, turns off the TV, looks him in the eye and says  ""Tell. Me. Everything."" 

The guy is completely bewildered at this point, but describes the incident to the best of his ability.

Puzzled by the day's occurrences, he gets his phone and sends a text to his ex: ""Hey, I told some of my friends I saw you in the train this morning and they all started asking me questions about it... Did you tell them anything? Did you talk to them?""

She soon replies: ""No, but the same thing happened to me! I guess it was an *ex-sighting* event!""",So a guy sees his ex-girlfriend on the train...,30
