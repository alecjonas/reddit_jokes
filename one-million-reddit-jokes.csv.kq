Naturally, the next moment they found themselves at the pearly gates where St. Peter greeted them as if they were old friends reunited.

At the end of the introductions, St. Peter said “I only have one question, sisters. Have you ever broken your vow of chastity?”

They looked at each other suspiciously, and finally Sister Mary summoned the nerve to say “Yes, your holiness, Father O’Callaghan visited me at night and I touched him in a sinful way.”  She was beside herself sobbing, as she believed she surely could never enter heaven as a common trollop.

“There, there, Mary. Come over to the holy water basin and dip whatever body part touched Father O’Callaghan’s penis.”

Mary couldn’t believe her ears! She wiped her tears away and leapt to her feet. “Do you really mean it, Your Holiness? I can be redeemed merely by a little holy water?”

“Of course sister,” St. Peter chortled. “You didn’t think we would let something like that keep a dedicated woman of the cloth out of heaven, did you?”

“Oh thank you, Holiness!” Mary said and gleefully dipped her index finger into the basin and pranced through the gates singing.

The other three sisters glanced at each other, and Peter invited the next to step up, Sister Catherine.

“Now then, Catherine, I ask you as well: have you ever broken your vow of chastity?”

She could only look at the floor, but she managed to mumble. “Yes, Holiness. Father O’Callaghan also visited me in the night, and I touched him sinfully.”

“I see,” said the eternal pontiff. “Do as Mary did and dip whatever body part that touched Father O’Callaghan’s penis into the Holy Basin.”

Catherine walked up and dipped both hands into the basin and strode through the gates, stopping only long enough to shout back to St. Peter, thanking him for his largesse.

“Come forward Theresa,” Peter beckoned. “Now then, have you ever-“

At this, Constance interrupted. “Excuse me, Holiness, but if I have to gargle that holy water, I’d rather do it *before* Theresa soaks her ass in it.”",Four nuns go to heaven,4

The policeman answered: ""No, someone more important than the governor.""

The chief finally asked: ""Is it the President?""

It is also the most expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000.

He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.

An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him.

The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, “What kind of car ya got there, sonny?”

The doctor replies, “A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!”

“That’s a lot of money,” says the old man. “Why does it cost so much?”

“Because this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!” states the doctor proudly.

The moped driver asks, “Mind if I take a look inside?”

“No problem,” replies the doctor.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.

Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, “That’s a pretty nice car, all right, but I’ll stick with my moped!”

Just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.

He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph.

Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror – what it could be…and suddenly…

WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH!

Something whips by him going much faster!

“What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?” the doctor asks himself.

He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 175 mph.

Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it’s the old man on the moped!

Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph.

WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH!

He’s feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN!

Astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 250 mph.

Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

The Ferrari is flat out, and there’s nothing he can do!

Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

The doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive.

He runs up to the mangled old man and says, “Oh my gosh! Is there anything I can do for you?”

The old man whispers, “Unhook my suspenders from your side mirror.”","A doctor goes out and buys the best car on the market, a brand new Ferrari GTO…",539

Kanye says, ""I am world's greatest talent. I must live.""  He takes a parachute and jumps.

Gates says, ""I have done so much philanthropy.  I deserve to live.""  He takes a parachute and jumps.

Trump tweets, ""I am the leader of the world. I will live.""  He grabs a parachute, flips the bird at the remaining two and jumps.

Biden says to the school girl, ""You are the future of this planet.  You must live. Go on, take the last parachute.""

The school girl smiles and replies, ""Relax Joe, we have two parachutes. Trump took my school bag and jumped.",[Long] Once 5 people were on a plane...,44

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do
not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
two, if you drank enough of it.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack
Samson.

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets
wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
You've been changed.

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
you.""

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
have to kill me?""

""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
fluid, and just denature it?""

""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the
second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
staring at him.

""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
request to me.""

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

""That takes two requests, Jack.""

""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you
accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
just start talking?""

""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""

""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,""
answered Nate.

""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up.
""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
No thanks. Just talk.""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start
looking at me as food.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack.""

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least.""

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know.""

""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious
again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with
his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it
to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his
shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?""

""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
Like he had a lot to think about.""

""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body
tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll
turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes,
straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there.
With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot
in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's ""Just Kidding!"" right before he felt the
now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.",The longest joke in the world,24

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. 

It protects it from the rain, and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to tell you something about my family. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.' 

'No problem,' he says.. 

And in they go. 

Joe is shocked. Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks. Dirty dishes. 

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word. 

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation. He leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word. He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents. 

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her Dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word. 

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too. Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table. 

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down. 

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still....Total silence. 

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. 

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father shouts - “I'll do the damned dishes!!”","Vaseline, Dinner and a Harley",110

Just as the sun was setting, one of them accidentally kicked the ladder over. Now the only way to get down was to jump into a pile of manure, but they couldn't remember how deep it was, and they couldn't see it since the sun went down.

The brother who kicked the ladder felt bad and said he would go first. He leapt from the hayloft and disappeared into the darkness. A moment passed and the one still in the hayloft called out to see if his brother was okay.

""I'm fine, but I can't find the ladder. You're gonna have to jump.""

Worried, the brother in the hayloft asked how deep it is. To his relief, his brother said it went up to his ankles. He gathered his courage and jumped. His feet hit the manure, but he didn't stop falling. When all was said and done, he was covered in shit up to his neck.

""I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS ANKLE DEEP!""

""Well, I jumped in headfirst.""",My favorite joke as a kid: Brothers in the Hayloft,40

So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either!",Can't you just love me for who I am,244

He says, “Ok since you’ve wasted my time I’m gonna give you another choice, either I get to fuck you in the ass, or you’re gonna suck my dick. I’m gonna finish getting the dogs ready and I’ll be back for your answer.” He goes to finish up with the dogs and comes back. “Alright, what’s it gonna be?” She says “I’m so sorry hon, how bout I suck your dick?” So he whips out his dick and she starts sucking and immediately turns her head and spits in disgust. “Oh my god, your dick tastes like shit!” He says, “Yeah, the dogs didn’t want to go either.”",A man decides to go hunting,12

It was a psychedelic maze game. She asked Jerry if he wanted to try it out, and amused by what he had seen, he did. 

About two minutes in, he's zoned into the game as he gets towards the end of the level, and the screen starts flashing all kinds of crazy colors, patterns, and sounds. 

Unknown to the employee who had shown him the game, Jerry has epilepsy. He started to go into a seizure

Of course, she calls 911, everyone locks all of the machines out and stops phone calls while all of this is going on, as it's a big deal. 

Jerry is ultimately fine, but the CEO has to intervene to see what exactly happened and report it for safety purposes. 

He asks the new employee, ""What the hell did you do?""

He asked his brother, ""what is two?""

His brother triumphantly said, ""superman!""

Next, he went to his older sister, who was listening to music and going along with it.

He asked his sister, ""what is three?""

His sister said: ""uh-huh, uh-huh""

After that, he stepped outside and saw the garbage man throwing their trash into the truck.

He asked the garbage man, ""what is four?""

The garbage man said: ""trash...trash, nothing but trash""

Finally, he went back inside and went up to his father, who was watching sports on TV.

He asked his father, ""what is five?""

His father said, ""seventy two and hit them hard!""

By that time it was late, so the boy decided to head to bed.

The next day at school, the teacher brought him up to the front and asked him to count to five.

The boy said: ""be quiet!""

Appalled, the teacher asked him, ""who do you think you are?!""

The boy said: ""superman!""

Now the teacher was furious. She asked him, ""do you want to head to the principal's office?!""

The boy said: ""uh-huh, uh-huh""

He was dragged out of the class and taken to the principal's office.

Once he got there, the principal asked him, ""kid, what do you think this school is made of?""

The boy said: ""trash...trash, nothing but trash""

Now for sure being punished, the principal asked him: ""alright, how many spankings do you think you deserve?""

He points to the first girl. She starts thinking. She responds ""uh, about 20 times"". St Peter shakes his head and says ""ok ok... well, I've seen worse."" He snaps his fingers and a 1998 Honda civic pops out of thin air. He says ""this will be your ride in Heaven. Enjoy"" She gets into the car and rides on in.

It's the 2nd girls turn. He asks the same question. She responds ""5 times"". He respond ""ok, not too bad. As you can see, we've had worse"". He snaps his fingers and a 2017 Ford Mustang pops out of thin air. She's pretty excited. She jumps into her new car and rides on in.

We have our last girl. He asks her ""so, how many times were you unfaithful"". She's grinning and responds ""I was never unfaithful. I was loyal to my husband my entire life!"". St Peter is glad to hear this ""ah, very good. Very good indeed"". He writes this down in his trusty book and yet again snaps his fingers and this time a brand new Ferrari pops out of thin air. She's extremely happy and she drives into heaven.

A few weeks pass and the first 2 girls with their Honda Civic and Ford Mustang are driving along together when they see their 3rd friends car parked on the side of the road. They stop to see what's wrong. There she is sitting down sobbing with her head tucked into her knees. They're a bit alarmed and try to console her ""Oh what's wrong?"" ""Are you ok?"". She responds to them ""No I'm not ok. Forget about it"". They reply ""no no, please tell us. Maybe we can help.

She gives in and starts telling them ""ok, well you see. My husband is here too now""

Her friends respond ""Well that's great. You can spend your time here with him now. Shouldn't you be happy?""

You will immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list and our lecturers are especially skilled at seeing you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.
Students who don't know S.H.I.T. will be placed in DEPARTMENTAL EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.).
Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to EDUCATIONAL ATTITUDE TRAINING (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, as they are all full of S.H.I.T. already. If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be intersted in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).
For students who are attending to pursue a carrier in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of MANAGERIAL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH EDUCATION (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.

The rabbi replied: “Think about it. To my grandchildren, I am two generations closer to Adam and Eve, the two individuals made by the hand of God. So they look up to me.

Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family’s only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation looked hopeless to her-how could she possibly continue to feed her family now? In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head. Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself. When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said,”I’ve seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, then I will restore your parents and the cow to you.” The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to get it up again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river. Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, “If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, then I will make everything right.” And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river. The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. And there he also met the mermaid. “I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.” The young son replied, “Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?” The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, “Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?” And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, “Why not THIRTY times in a row?” Finally, she said, “Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health.” Then the young son asked, “Wait!

This is a very common problem that men complain about.

Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed.

You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes Dear"" to alleviate software augmentation.

The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway.

Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0!

WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system!

Best of luck,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.
In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.

What can I do?
Signed, Desperate
Dear Desperate,
First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System.
Please enter the command ""! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.
But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta.
Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program.
These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.
In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7.
Good Luck, Tech Support",I have upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0!!!!,246

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said:  ""1-2-3!” Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and asked: ""What was the 1-2-3 for?”

St. Peter chains them together and says, ""Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!""

The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck and along comes St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman.
The third woman has observed all this and, not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is very, VERY careful where she steps.

She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on ... very tall, long eyelashes, muscular, and thin.

St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.

The first time an issue presents itself is when Lent rolls around.  During Lent, the Catholics in the neighborhood all swear off red meat.  Every day at lunch, however, as his neighbors were eating cold tuna sandwiches, the Protestant would grill himself a big, juicy steak that could be smelled throughout the neighborhood.

Several weeks into Lent, the Catholics meet after Mass to discuss the issue.  They didn't want to be unneighborly, but the smell was really driving them crazy.

Then, one of them comes up with a suggestion: since the Protestant moved to a Catholic community, maybe he'd be open to converting.  While it wouldn't fix the problem that year, it would make next year's Lent go much more smoothly.  After much debate, they agree to bring the offer to the Protestant.

To their surprise and delight, he is completely open to converting.  He goes through the process and gets rebaptized as a Catholic.  The entire neighborhood shows up for his confirmation, where the priest splashes him with holy water while saying, ""You were born a Protestant ... you were raised a Protestant ... and now you're a Catholic.""

The next year goes smoothly, and the whole neighborhood gets along great.  Then, Lent rolls around again.  As everyone is at home with their cold tuna sandwiches, a smell permeates the air: charcoal, wood chips, STEAK.  Confused, everyone rushes over to the convert's house.

They find him standing over his grill, a juicy steak cooking away.  He's splashing the slab of meat with beer, and the neighbors hear him speaking in a solemn voice.

""You were born a cow ... you were raised a cow ... and now you're a fish.""",My favorite Lent joke (as told to me by an Episcopal reverend),567

""Do you mind if I ask, what happened to your pig ?"" the man asks the farmer.

""You mean her face ? This pig saved my life. I was out hunting last winter when a pack of starving wolves came out of nowhere. They had me surrounded before I even noticed they were there. The pack leader came towards me, snarling and snapping it's jaws when out of nowhere this pink flash barrels into the side of the wolf. My pig here had followed me out into the snow and seeing I was in danger, came to my rescue. She fought the pack leader all on her own, took a few bites and scratches to the face. Lost an eye in the fight. But she never gave up, and eventually the pack leader ran off whimpering and the rest of the pack followed. She saved my life that day, I tell you.""

""Wow, what a story ! And that scarred up her back too ?""

""No, those are burns. We had a house fire a couple of months back. It happened in the dead of night. I wasn't even aware of it until I noticed my pig here snorting and grunting to wake me up. She must've smelled the smoke and come into the house to save us. I gathered up the family as best I could, dragging the kids outside to safety. But once we were out of the house I noticed two of the kids were still missing. That's when my pig here came out of the blazing house, dragging my second youngest by the collar. She dropped him to the dirt and then leaped straight back in to the inferno. I thought I'd never see her or my youngest again. But a few minutes later she came struggling out. Probably hit by some burning debris because her back was badly burnt. But she pulled my youngest daughter from the fire with barely a scratch. Saved both of those kids, she did.""

The man is astonished. ""What an amazing animal ! How did she lose her leg ?""

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist.

He then walks over to the other horse and asks the same question.

The boy tending it replies ""both its forelegs are broke.""

He thumbs back that hammer again and BOOM, blows that horses head off.

They had a great time.

However, after all the partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to College until early

Monday morning.

Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor after the final and explain to him why they missed it. They explained that they had gone to an Old age home in the nearest town to spend some time with aged people for the weekend with the plan to come back and study but, unfortunately, they had a flat tire on the way back, didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time.

As a result, they missed the final.

The Professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day.

The guys were elated and relieved.

They studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them.

He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to begin.

They looked at the first problem, worth 5 points.

It was the easiest question in their entire syllabus.

""Cool,"" they thought at the same time, each one in his separate room.

""This is going to be easy.""

Each finished the problem and then turned the page.

On the second page was written: (For 95 points): Which tire?","Four friends were so well prepared for the finals that the weekend before finals,",9
