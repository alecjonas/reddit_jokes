“Look at that,” says the biologist. “Apparently the sheep in Scotland are black.”

“Nonsense!” says the physicist. “All we can say for sure is that there is one sheep in Scotland that’s black.”

“I am afraid you are both wrong,” the mathematician explains. “The only thing that is certain is that there is a sheep in Scotland, which is black on at least one side.”

he comes across a Harley with a 'for sale' sign on it.  The bike looks
better than a new one, although it is 10 years old, It's shiny and in mint
condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10
years.  

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside
and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.  It protects it from the
rain"", and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents.
Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to tell
you something about my family.  When we eat dinner, we don't talk.  In fact,
the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go. 

Joe is shocked.  Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of
dirty dishes.  In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on
the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks.  Dirty dishes.  

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.  As dinner
progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  He leans over
and kisses Sandra.  No one says a word.  He reaches over and fondles her
breasts. Nobody says a word.  So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes
off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her
parents.  His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid
and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.  Joe grabs mom, bends her
over the table, pulls down her panties and screws her every which way but
loose right there on the dinner table.  Joe sits down.  His girlfriend is
furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But
still....Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls out the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts, 'I'll do the fuckin' dishes!!'",Motorcycle and vasaline,489

You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'Killer Chili'. Tasty stuff, albeit hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.

 Here's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement 2'. Despite habanera peppers swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I appeared to be unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my next door neighbors as thunder and lightning.

 Knowing that a time of reckoning had to come, yet not sure of when, I bravely set off for the market; a local Wal-Mart grocery store that I often haunt in search of tasty tidbits.

 Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the restrooms that the pain hit me. Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh oh, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.

 The habaneras in the chili from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The peppers fired a warning shot.

 There I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle, suddenly enveloped in a noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me. Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly woman turned into it.

 I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the malodorous effluvium that refused to dissipate, as she walked into it unsuspecting. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.

 I could've warned that poor woman but didn't. I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her arms about her head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. Big Mistake.

 Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.

 Suddenly things were no longer funny. IT was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand mal assplosion took place.

 Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, ' Oh my Lord', then quickly left.

 Once finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'

 That of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.

 Home again without having shopped, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Food Town. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. They claim they're going to have to repaint the store. ",Man Gets Biggest Shock Ever After Eating A Hot Chilli.

So he got his wife to promise him with all her heart that when he died she would put all the money in the casket with him. When one day he died.

He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, ""Wait a minute!""


 
She had a shoe box with her, she came over with the box and placed it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket and rolled it away.

Her friend said, ""I hope you weren't crazy enough to put all that money in there with that stingy old man.""

She said, ""Yes, I promised. I'm a good Christian, I can't lie. I promised him that I was to put that money in that casket with him.""

""You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him?""

The one that's in, sends players out one at a time, to see if they can get in before they get out. If they get out before they get in, they come in, but it doesn't count. If they get in before they get out it does count.

When the ones out get three outs from the ones in before they get in without being out, the team that's out comes in and the team in goes out to get those going in out before they get in without being out.

When both teams have been in and out nine times the game is over. The team with the most in without being out before coming in wins unless the ones in are equal. In which case, the last ones in go out to get the ones in out before they get in without being out.

The game will end when each team has the same number of ins out but one team has more in without being out before coming in.

Although not familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat out. She motors out a short distance, anchors, puts her feet up, and begins to read her book. The peace and solitude are magnificent.

Along comes a Fish and Game Warden in his boat.
He pulls up alongside the woman and says, 'Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?'

'Reading a book,' she replies, (thinking, 'Isn't that obvious?').

'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her.

'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading.'

'Yes, but I see you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.'

'If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,' says the woman.

'But I haven't even touched you,' says the Game Warden.

'That's true, but you have all the equipment.
For all I know you could start at any moment.'

'Have a nice day ma'am,' and he left.

It will make you think of the phrase: ”You come in this world with nothing and you die with nothing.” One man obviously didn’t feel this was the case when he asked his wife, “When I die, can you bury all of the money with me?”.

He wanted her to put it all in the casket with him. Thinking that she would fulfill his last dying wish he thought nothing more of it.

During his working life this man was a real cheapskate, and only spent when he really had to. He saved it all in this little shoe box you can see below.

When he eventually passed away, “He was laid out and his wife sat next to her life-long friend. When the ceremony was just about to finish, and the coffin was about to be covered he wife screamed, “Wait one second!”.

“He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, ‘Wait a minute!’ She walked over and placed the shoebox in the casket.
Her friend asked her, “Surely you weren’t silly enough to put all that money in there!” The women responded, “Yeh I had to keep my promise, I am a good Christian, I’d never break a promise”.
The friend said, “What! You put every last cent in there with him?!”
The women responded, “No, I counted it all up, put it in my bank account, and wrote him a cheque!

There is a lot of screaming and shouting inside, along with breaking furniture and shattering crockery. Worst off all, it seems to be coming from two very distinctly different voices. 


Concerned, Rabbit looks to those around him and asks, “Will anybody go inside and see what all that noise is about?” Tigger immediately throws up a paw and bounds through the door before another word is said. When he comes out, he’s very, very pale. Rabbit asks him what he saw. He won’t answer. Instead, he sits on a log and stares ahead, eyes focused somewhere miles away.


Rabbit asks again if anyone is willing to see what’s going on in there, as the shouting still hasn’t stopped yet. If anything, it’s gotten even louder. Nervously, Piglet offers up a hand and creeps through the door. When he comes back, he’s also gone very pale and sits down beside Tigger before breaking out into inconsolable tears. All that can be made out through his sobbing is the words “Christopher Robin”. Rabbit, sweating bullets, asks if anyone else would like to try. The screaming in the house is building to a very definite crescendo now. With a sigh, Eeyore stands up and shuffles morosely inside. 


A few seconds later, the screaming has stopped. The silence is almost deafening. Rabbit is about to ask again if anyone will look inside, when the door opens and Eeyore walks out, none the worse for wear except for a stench wafting off him that Rabbit cannot place. Eeyore walks over to the log and sits on it, nibbling on a stalk of grass as he chuckles softly to himself. 


Rabbit, extremely disturbed, sidles as close as the horrible odor wafting off Eeyore will allow and asks, “Is everyone alright? What was that about?”


Eeyore chuckles again, chews the blade of grass thoughtfully a couple moments longer, then says, “Yeah, everyone’s fine.” He glances at his two neighbors, still emotionally shattered, and snorts. “Don’t see what all the fuss was about. You act like you’ve never seen a fella taking a Pooh before.”",In the Hundred Acre Wood.,5

The next week, the manager asks the boy to clean and feed the chimp enclosures. Unfortunately the same accident befalls the chimps as the fish had, and again, the boy wheelbarrows them to the zoo's lion and feeds it the chimps, and as before all evidence was eaten by the lion.

The next day the manager asks the boy to smoke out the bees and collect their honey. The boy does this, but over smokes the bees and they all die from suffocation. The boy collects them in his wheelbarrow and mushes them down to a paste to feed to the lion.

post,3cvgj5,2qh72,jokes,false,1436582832,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3cvgj5/a_tale_of_two_unfortunate_aggies/,self.jokes,,"Two Aggies went ice fishing, but it was kind of a bust.  They spent all weekend just clearing enough ice to get the boat in the water, and didn't have time to actually fish.

Someone was kind enough to explain to them how you ice fish.  So they went to a new spot (too ashamed to go to the old one.)  They took out their drill to cut through the ice.  They heard a huge voice booming out of no where, ""THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""  They're a little discomfited, but seeing no one around, they set up and start drilling.  Again, the voice, ""THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""  This time they can't take it any more, and one of them screams ""WHO WAS THAT?""  The booming voice replies, ""THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT OF CHAPARRAL ICE RINKS, AND THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""

Since ice fishing wasn't working out, they went hunting, and promptly got lost.  One of them says, ""WAIT, I heard that if you fire a shot off into the air, someone will hear and come find you.""  So they tried that.  And tried it again later.  Eventually the other one says, ""I'm not sure about this.  I'm running out of arrows.""

Eventually, one of the aggies got the idea that he could just use a map and a compass to find their way out.  His friend says, ""Wait, you've had that the whole time?""  So he sat down on the ground and studied the map for a solid 15 minutes, studied the compass and then studied  the map some more.  Finally, he jumped up and shouted, ""GOT IT!""  His friend said, ""GREAT!  Where are we?""  He said, ""See that tall tree sticking up from the top of that hill?""  His friend said, ""I sure do!""  And he replied, ""We're at the top of it!""

Fortunately, our two Aggies eventually stumbled across some tracks, and since they were getting awful hungry, they followed them hoping to find some food.  Sadly, the train killed them.

""Aggies"" in this context are the intelligent, educated people of Texas A&amp;M University.  Jokes like the above are very common at the rival school, University of Texas, but I actually heard these, and many others from an alumni of A&amp;M.  (RIP, Charles Elliott)  From what I can tell, Texas A&amp;M actually has higher academic standards than UT, so no one is really taking it seriously.",A Tale of Two Unfortunate Aggies,1
post,3cvgf6,2qh72,jokes,false,1436582762,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3cvgf6/i_hate_my_job/,self.jokes,,"You think your job sucks? Let me tell you about the people I work with.


First, there's this supermodel wanna-be chick. Ok, I'll admit, she's pretty hot, but damn she is completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on her makeup. She is extremely self centered and never considers the needs of anyone other than herself. She is dumber than a box of rocks and I find it surprising that she has enough brain power to breathe.


The next chick is exactly the opposite- she might even be one of the smartest girls on the planet. She has endless career opportunities but she's still here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I doubt she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive past the hardware store she moans like a cat in heat.


But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. The guy is baked before he comes to work, after work, and even during work. He probably hasn't been sober any time in the last 10 years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and, to make things worse, brings his fucking giant dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walking around half stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonald's and Burger King every single fucking day.


Anyways, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job,1

The decision to hire them was brought about by a recent documentary on how the unemployed youths from Harlem were able to remove a set of wheels in less than 6 seconds without proper equipment, whereas Gordon's existing crew could only do it in 8 seconds with thousands of dollars' worth of expensive high tech equipment.

It was thought to be an excellent and bold move by Gordon's management team, as many races are won or lost in the pits.

However, Gordon got more than he bargained for. At the crew's first practice session, not only was the inexperienced crew able to change all four wheels in under 6 seconds, but within 9 seconds they had changed the paint scheme, altered the VIN number, and sold the car to Dale Earnhardt Jr, for ten cases of Bud, a bag of weed, ",Jeff Gordon announced today,1

He told me that there isn't an awful lot of a stand-up culture in the country, but the people themselves are receptive to certain kinds of jokes in certain regions. He said ""Well if you make jokes on alcohol, a large number of them will not tolerate it, but whether they like jokes based on a certain kind of cuisine depends on both the region and the amount of exposure.""

I was pretty confused on hearing this, and asked, ""So does that mean if certain regions are more exposed to a certain food culture, they would be more receptive and nuanced in their reaction? Take Chinese food, for example. If people get accustomed to it, then will they find humor around it somewhat funnier?""

So then he said, ""Well actually that's a very good point. I went to this Iranian village called Tuabar, and - sometimes I organize such events around the country, for exposure on both sides - I was making a couple of jokes. The political jokes were wonderfully received, a lot of them had an idea of what went on, but when it came to some foreign jokes, like what you said - Chinese food jokes - the reception was lukewarm to say the least.""

Then I replied, ""Well I guess you've got to cook Chinese food for the folks in Tuabar then, haha!""

He responded: ""Amen, woks in Tuabar!""

I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO JESUS CHRIST, GO!!!""
Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.
Several cars behind, a very nice man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, ""Mother trucker,"" or ""Mother's from there."" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection.

From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.
One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.
All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.
At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.
So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: ""Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement.""

One summer he invited a lawyer from the Czech Republic to visit. The friend, eager to see how a wealthy American vacationed, gratefully agreed. They had a wonderful vacation, and spent a great deal of time exploring the woods and enjoying the natural setting. 

One morning, as the lawyer and his Czech friend were walking through the woods, they were approached by two huge bears -- a male and a female. The lawyer noticed them in time to run for cover. His friend, however, was not so lucky. The male bear reached him and swallowed him whole. 

Seeing this, the lawyer ran to his Mercedes and sped for the nearest town to get the local sheriff. The sheriff grabbed a high-powered rifle and they raced back to the berry patch. Luckily, the bears were still there. 

""He's in THAT one!"" cried the lawyer, pointing at the bear that had consumed his friend. ""Quick -- shoot it. Maybe we can still save my friend!"" 

The sheriff looked at the bears, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and shot the female. His aim was true, and the female bear collapsed to the ground. The startled male fled into the woods. 

""Why did you do that?"" demanded the lawyer, ""I said he was in the other bear!"" 

""Exactly,"" replied the sheriff. ""Would you believe a lawyer who told you that the Czech was in the male?

flea says, “i want to go somewhere bright and sunny, somewhere that i can just relax and enjoy myself, don’t want to worry about anything.”

travel agent says “okay” and starts flipping through his catalogue book. after some research, the travel agent announces proudly, “okay, i can give you one week in Nice, in Ringo Starr‘s hair.”

so off the flea goes.

after 4 days, the flea comes back to the travel agent.

travel agent asks, “what are you doing back here? aren’t you supposed to be on holiday?”

flea says, “oh that was an awful holiday! he spends all his time indoors, he’s always banging on the drums, he never goes out, it’s noisey and smelly. he’s always shaking his head from side to head, i got a terrible migraine! I just want a nice relaxing holiday, you know, out in the sun. i want to relax!”

so the travel agent picks up another catalogue and does some flipping through. suddenly he announces, “okay, i can give you one week in Monte Carlo, in Omar Sharif‘s moustache.”

so off the flea goes.

after 4 days, the flea comes back to the travel agent.

travel agent asks, “you’re back so soon? what was wrong with that holiday?”

flea says, “oh that holiday was even worse! he spends all his time in the casino gambling. and what’s worse, he smokes so much, all the smoke went up into his moustache, i got burnt from a bit of ash and cinders, it was smelly and ugh! it was no good, no good! i just want to relax! i want sunshine and sand and blue skies!”

so the travel agent picks up another catalogue and does some research. after a long period, finally he announces, “okay, we’ve had a cancellation, and this is perfect for you. i can give you one week in St Tropez, in Brigitte Bardot‘s muff.”

so off the flea goes.

after 4 days, the flea returns to the travel agent.

“what!!” the travel agent exclaims, completely flabberghasted. “what are you doing here?! what was wrong with that holiday?!”

“oh nothing!” replies the flea. “it was lovely. she’s so lovely. she just lays out all day long in the beautiful sand, on the beach, she soaks up a lot of sun, she had this radio next to her playing this delightfully relaxing music… i had a wonderful time there, it was the best holiday i’ve had.”

puzzled, the travel agent asks, “well if it was so great, what are you doing back here so early?”

flea replies, “you tell me! after 3 days, i found myself back in Omar Sharif’s moustache.”

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.""

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.""

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""",Chinese Torture - Trust me you will love it.,0

post,3cr043,2qh72,jokes,false,1436493753,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3cr043/the_cave_of_dreams/,self.jokes,,"Three friends grew up together in Seattle their names were Mike, Steve, and Davonte. As children the boys had an odd friend in the homeless gentleman that lived in there neighborhood. They used to tell their parents they were going to an arcade, and head down to the park instead. There they would give thean some change and he would tell them stories about ""The cave of dreams"" and it's endless treasure.

   When it came time for the boys to venture out into the world they made one last trip to the park to see their old friend. There they discovered his body laying peacefully in the grass. His spirit having left in his sleep. Next to his body was an old decrepit piece of parchment Steve picked it up for examination. It was a map which revealed that the fabled cave of dreams was in right there in Seattle hidden in plain sight. The three wanting to honor their departed friend (and more than a little curious about the treasure) decided to enter the cave.

   After making the trek, they dove into a lake bags in tow with which to carry their riches. The enter the cave they had to dive into a lake and swim down a passage in it'so bed. On the other end of the passage they emerged to a dark damp underground cave with three paths. Mike took the path on the left Steve took the middle path and Davonte took the path on the right.

   As Mike walked down his path he noticed standing water getting progressively deeper the further he walked and he was amazed by how long the path was he had been walking for nearly half an hour and decided to take a break when he leaned up against the wall and realized there was water running down the wall the entire length of the path. He thought this was odd but continued walking thoughts of endless wealth pushing him forward. When he finally got to the end of the path the water was up to his neck. There was a door and on the door was a sign, it read ""Beyond this door lies a vast treasure but any who enter will meet a horrible demise"". Never the overly cautious type Mike opened the door and found a room the size of a theater filled with more treasure than you could imagine gold, jewels, ancient artifacts the whole shabang. The water rushed through the doorway but seemed to drain somehow into the floor if the treasure room. Mike stuffed his bag and pocket with as much treasure as he could carry and discovered an exit at the back of the room.

   Steve who took the middle path walked down the path and as he got further down he noticed it getting hotter and hotter. Before too long he had to rest and he went to lean up against the wall but immediately yanked his hand back for the wall was hot like a pan just off the stove. By the time he got to the end of the path it was so hot he could hardly breath. There was an identical door to the one Mike came across but Steve too ignored the cryptic message and entered the next room. Relief washed over him as the cool air from the treasure room overpowered the heat. He gathered as much treasure as he could and exited through the back.

   Now all that remained was Davonte he noticed that the floor to his path was slippery and he felt strange occasional tremors in the ground but thought nothing of it and continued down the path. Like his friendson Davonte eventually had to rest and went to lean against the wall the wall too was slippery and he realized the tremors he had been experiencing were caused by the surrounding corridor pulsating like it was a living thing. Davonte was scared but the promise of treasure kept him going until he too came to an identical door with the same sign. He passed through it cautiously on the other side was a similar treasure to what his friends found and after gathering all he could he exited through the back, there he found his friends waiting they told each other all about their adventures on the way back into town.

   As the years went by the friends branched off and began to live their own lives. Exactly five years later they were all quite successful the treasure was worth more than the had ever imagined each piece being nearly priceless. Mike was out on his yacht with his third supermodel wife when he went inside to use the rest room. After doing his business he turned n the faucet to was his hands but the moment his skin made contact with the water he evaporated, vanished in thin air. It was assumed his wife pushed him over the edge in hopes of obtaining his wealth, and though saddened by news of their friends demise Steve an Davonte failed to make the connection between it and the cave of dreams.

   Another five years pass and Steve is close to bankruptcy. He had managed to squander almost all of his wealth living a lifestyle that an emperor could only describe as lavish and overly self-indulgent. Depressed he had turned to drugs and spiraled downwards to more and more dangerous substances. He ran a spoonful of heroin over a flame so that he could inject it into his arm. For just a moment the flame came in contact with his skin and when it did he evaporated into thin air. A search team was formed but Steve was of course never found. Everyone assumed a drug deal had gone bad and that Steve was at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, everyone except Davonte.

   While his friends wasted their money partying, Davonte was building an empire. He made the connection that both of his friend died on the same day and then that it was the day they visited the cave. He didn't know what it was but he knew that there was some force at work, and that the sign on the door had been true, most importantly though he knew he had five years and he wasn't going down without a fight.

   Using his vast wealth he began construction on a fortress strong enough to withstand any attack and had his living quarters placed in the center with layers of protection on all sides. He bought out private military corporations and built a private army that rivaled many countries in strength. When the day finally arrived he sat nervously in his room his entire army spread throughout. With orders to report any strange activity. Sure enough a strange geometrical shape appeared on the radar traveling towards the fortress at incredible speeds. When it came in contact with the outer wall it broke through without taking a scratch. It slowed down significantly and started creeping through the fortress Davontes soldiers showered it with ammunition an explosives but nothing seemed to affect it it broke through wall after wall until it came to the innermost layer where Steve waited  with his 10 best men. The object was dark brown and floated through the air directly toward Davonte unaffected by the soldiers efforts to stop it. Davonte was terrified he ran into the bathroom and slammed the door but of course the object busted right through. Davonte could now clearly see the object was a box or a coffin to be exact if he hadnt been so scared he may have laughed, his own coff in was coming to kI'll hin. He knew then that it was over but still he weakly struggled against it. He ripped the curtain rod off the shower and threw it at the coffin. He started yelling at it and throwing anything he could at it a scented candle, tylenol, soap, shampoo. When it was only feet away and still creeping forward he grabbed the last thing near him a pack of Vick's Cold and Flu and threw it. The coffin stopped. Davonte let out a nervous laugh, he'd done it he'd cheated the prophecy and survived. He built a family and lived a long joy filled life never once taking any of it for granted, knowing how lucky he was to be alive.

That may seem like the moral of the story, love life you never know when it'll end, but it isn't. The actual moral of the story is that VICK'S. WILL. STOP. YOUR. COFFIN.",The cave of dreams,18

So he does. With it, she gets the house renovated. The next month, she says, ""For every ten cents you earn, steal not one, not two, not three, but four cents with which I can buy what I want.""

So he does. She starts placing the money into her bank account. The next month, she says, ""For every ten cents you earn, steal not one, not two, not three, not four, but five cents with which I can buy what I want.""

So he does. The money goes into her account. The next month, she says, ""For every ten cents you earn, steal not one, not two, not three, not four not five, but six cents with which I can buy what I want.""

So he does. Even more in the account. They get closer and closer to their own retirement. The next month, she says, ""For every ten cents you earn, steal not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, but seven cents with which I can buy what I want.""

Once again, he goes to the electric chair, his head is shaved, and the lever is pulled again, and he survives. Then, he is brought before the Supreme Court. ""For stealing not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight, not nine, but ten cents for every ten cents you earn, you are sentenced to death."" 

He goes to the electric chair once more, the same routine, he survives. Then, he is brought before the entire UN. ""For stealing not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight, not nine, but ten cents for every ten cents you earn, you are sentenced to death.""

Mother. ""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!"" ""I don't want to talk to you, the old woman says."" You are not my son!"" ""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've

Jesus then says, ""and I bet I could get it for most followed person in history.""

Hitler raises his beer and proclaims, ""and I could get the record for the worst person in history!""

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?""

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. You must not lay a finger on my daughter.""

""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.

He woke to feel a heavy weight on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, *""Chinese Torture Number 1: Large rock on chest.""* ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read *""Chinese Torture Number 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""* In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, *""Chinese Torture Numer 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""*

A man boarded an airplane and took his seat. As he settled in, he glanced up and saw a spectacular gorgeous woman boarding the plane. He soon realized she was heading straight toward his seat. As if his prayers were answered, she took the seat right beside his. 

Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, ""Business trip or vacation?""

She turned, smiled, and said, ""Business. The Annual Sexual Education Convention in Chicago.""

He swallowed hard. Here was this most beautiful woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting for sex education! Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your business role at this convention?"" 

""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use my experience to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really,"" he said. ""What myths are those?""

""Well,"" she explained. ""One popular myth is that African American men are the most well endowed, when in fact it's the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent. We have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is the Southern Redneck.""

Suddenly, the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""I really shouldn't be discussing this with you. I don't even know your name.""

The women both reply, 'It won't do you any good.' The foreign man says, 'Me not understand. What you mean 'won't do me any good'?' The first woman says, 'We're lesbians.' To which the foreign man asks, 'Lesbians? What is a lesbians?' To which the second woman replies, 'Lesbians! we like to lick pussy.'

You know why the Aggies don't have ice cubes in the dorm any more?  It's because the guy with the recipe graduated.

I've heard that recipe calls for a heaping tablespoon of water.

How many Aggies does it take to eat an armadillo?

Three.  One to eat it, and two to watch for traffic.

Two Aggies went ice fishing, but it was kind of a bust.  Spent all weekend just clearing enough ice to get the boat in the water.

Someone was kind enough to explain to them how you ice fish.  So they went to a new spot (too ashamed to go to the old one.)  They took out their drill to cut through the ice.  They heard a huge voice booming out of no where, ""THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""  They're a little discomfited, but seeing no one around, they set up and start drilling.  Again, the voice, ""THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""  This time they can't take it any more, and one of them screams ""WHO WAS THAT?""  The booming voice replies, ""THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT OF CHAPARRAL ICE RINKS, AND THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.""

Since ice fishing wasn't working out, they went hunting, and promptly got lost.  One of them says, ""WAIT, I heard that if you fire a shot off into the air, someone will hear and come find you.""  So they tried that.  And tried it again later.  Eventually the other one says, ""I'm not sure about this.  I'm running out of arrows.""

Eventually, one of the aggies got the idea that he could just use a map and a compass to find their way out.  His friend says, ""Wait, you've had that the whole time?""  So he sat down on the ground and studied the map for a solid 15 minutes, studied the compass and then studied  the map some more.  Finally, he jumped up and shouted, ""GOT IT!""  His friend said, ""GREAT!  Where are we?""  He said, ""See that tall tree sticking up from the top of that hill?""  His friend said, ""I sure do!""  And he replied, ""We're at the top of it!""

Fortunately, our two Aggies eventually stumbled across some tracks, and since they were getting awful hungry, they followed them hoping to find some food.  Sadly, the train killed them.

Then using God's great gifts, Satan created Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and Krispy Kreme Donuts. And Satan said, ""You want chocolate with that?"" And Man said ""Yes!"" and Woman said, ""and as long as you're at it, ad some sprinkles!"" And they gained 10 pounds and Satan smiled. 

And God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep the figure that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat, and sugar from the cane and combined them. And woman went from size 6 to size 14.

So God said, ""Try my fresh green salad."" And Satan presented Thousand-Island Dressing, buttery croutons, and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.

God then said, ""I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them. And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.

God then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it ""Angel Food Cake,"" and said, ""It is good."" Satan then created chocolate cake and named it ""Devil's Food.""

God then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before flickering blue light and gained pounds.

God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then said, ""You want fries with that?"" And Man replied ""Yes!"" and Satan said, ""It is good."" And Man went into cardiac arrest.

God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

Then Satan created HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations).

When Colm arrives at his ball, he sees a little red bearded man dressed in green lying unconscious with a large knot on his forehead. ""Jesus, Mary and Joesph"" exclaimed Colm,  ""I've just killed a bloody Leprechaun!"" After hemming and hawing about what to do for a minute, he decides to flee. Just then the Leprechaun stirred and then sat up. ""Weel ya got me!"" slurred the Leprechaun. Colm, not knowing what to do or say just stared blankly, mouth agape. ""I see  tha cat has got your tongue."" said the Leprechaun smiling. ""You foyn sir are due three wishes."" This was more than poor Colm could take. So he ran (golf clubs in tow) for the club house. 

The perplexed Leprechaun decided that rules were rules and that he would grant the three wishes in the golfer's stead. The three wishes he granted were. 1) The golfer would always have great rounds of golf. 2) The golfer would never want for money. 3)  From here on out, the golfer would have the best sex of his life.

One year later Colm was golfing the same course and on the third hole, at the same bunker, the Leprechaun materialized. The Leprechaun asked a startled Colm how his year had been. ""This year has been amazing"" said Colm. ""I've golfed twice a week and birdied every hole!"" He continued, ""Amazingly, every time I went to the pub for a pint a new 20 pound note was in my wallet. And, I had great sex once  a month."" The confused Leprechaun asked, ""sex only once per month?"" Colm replied, ""yeah, but  that's not too bad for priest with a small parrish.""
