""See that old man asleep in the chair by the fire- place? He is our oldest member and can tell you some hunting stories you'll never forget.""

They awakened the old man and asked him to tell them a hunting story.

""Well,"" he began,
""I remember back in '44', we went on a lion hunting expedition in Africa. We were on foot and hunted for three days without seeing a thing. On the fourth day, I was so tired I had to rest. I found a fallen tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and fell asleep. I don't know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise in the bushes. I was reaching for my gun when the biggest lion I ever seen jumped out of the bushes at me like this, 'ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!......'
Well... I just shit my pants.""

The young men looked astonished and one of them said,
""I don't blame you, I would have shit my pants too if a lion jumped out at me.""

The old man shook his head and said,
""No, no, not then, just now when I said
'ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!'""",The old man and the bear.,47

Then A comes in, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor. Then the bartender notices B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and says, ""Get out! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight!""

Eventually C sobers up and realizes in horror that he's under a rest. C is brought to trial, found guilty of contributing to the diminution of a minor, and is sentenced to 10 years of D.S. without Coda at an upscale correctional facility which leads to the moral of our story:

He ended up failing to recognize a stop sign and as a result his train hit a person and killed them immediately. He was tried for manslaughter and sentenced to the electric chair. Just before being put in the chair, he was given the choice of final meal and chose a single banana, oddly. His time came and he was placed into the chair, the room vacated and then the switch was thrown.

But... Nothing. No sparks, no burning, nothing. They checked the machine and it was working fine, it just seemed not to harm him. The state law meant that, legally, his sentence had been carried out and he was free to go. He walked away a free man, and actually got another job as a train driver.

Sadly, almost exactly the same thing happened again. This time his negligence killed two kids playing around on the tracks when again he'd fallen asleep and failed to stop the train in time. Hauled before the courts again, he got exactly the same sentence - the electric chair. He was asked again for his final meal, chose two bananas this time, and his sentence was carried out again.

And yet again, he didn't die. In fact, he was entirely unharmed. The state law remained the same, so he was let out again, where - somehow - he got another job with another train company. I guess it was the only job he was trained for (pardon the pun). Anyway, this time he did much better and worked hard to stay awake during his late shifts. But sure enough, eventually he slipped back in to old habits and this time killed five people - a family trying to free their dog stuck in the tracks.

Once again he faced a jury, once again they found him guilty and a judge sentenced him to the electric chair. This time he asked for 5 bananas, but the guard was wily - he has read about this man and how he always had bananas before his sentence was carried out, and so this time (with a grin, it's said) he brought the train driver 5 apples instead. The guilty man plead and begged for bananas, but the guard claimed it was an honest mistake but too late to change now.

The man was lead for a third time to the electric chair. His head was whetted, his arms strapped in, and the guard eyed him with something between wonder and fear. Finally the room was vacated and the switch thrown. Surely this time the machine would do its job? With the process finished, the guard ran back into the room, only to find the man still alive and looking entirely healthy. ""I don't understand! I set the equipment up myself, I know I did it right, and I know it's all working! And I didn't let you have any bananas! Please, you have to tell me - why are you still alive?""

""It's quite simple"" replied the train driver. ""It has nothing to do with the bananas - I'm just a really, really bad conductor.""",I heard a story once about an American train driver.,28

 After we somehow won we were too deep in the string of lies, so we just wrote that declaration of whatever and then we just kinda were dumbfounded. We spent a lot of time talking about it in that scorching hot building. We didn't let the news cover it because this was a secret truth about the war!

Honestly we were planning to sell ourselves to Britain but then some guy, I dont remember his name washington something? He said he wanted to be a leader or whatever and he kinda took over.

They arrived at the whorehouse later on that night and each made their choices of prostitute and then headed off with their ladies of the night into two bedrooms which were situated next door to each other.

The first midget, John, hurriedly stripped off all of his clothes as there was no time to waste.
Unfortunately he encountered a problem, he was unable to get an erection.
The prostitute did everything she was capable of to rectify the problem, but nothing would work!

To make matters worse, all he could hear from his mate Gary next door, was one-two-three uhh, one-two-three uhh all night long.

The next morning after an unsuccessful night John left the room, as he did so he bumped into Gary leaving his room.

"" What kind of night did you have ? "" John asked Gary
"" I don’t want to talk about it “ Gary replied angrily 
“ What are you so upset about, I couldn't get a hard-on all night “ John replied
“ A hard on? "" said Gary, "" I couldn't even get on the damn bed! """,Two midgets were having a discussion one night about their ever dwindling memories of the last time they had sex.,3

The big ex-wrestler figures his diminutive colleague won't be able to keep up with him in the drinking stakes, so is surprised to find that when last orders are called, Hart has kept pace with no ill effects.

Johnson decides to up the ante with his final round, lining up a series of shots in front of the pair. First up, two fingers of bourbon, and both men down them without batting an eyelid. Next comes a flaming sambuca, and the pair see them away with a flourish.

The Rock is amazed at his friend's stamina, but is sure the final drink will be the last straw. They line up a shot of a strong smelling green liqueur, clink glasses together and drain them in one.

""That is some strong shit!"" shouts the stand-up comic, whooping and hollering, but seemingly still fine. Until, that is, he falls off his barstool and flat on his face on the floor. Lying there on the floor, his friend can only hear him repeating the same three names over and over again:

""Peter...Bridget...Jane...Peter...Bridget...Jane...Peter...Bridget...Jane""

Johnson has never seen anything like it, and turns to the barman.

""What the hell is happening? He was fine with all the other drinks we had, but that last shot has really done for him! All he seems to be doing is saying those three names over and over again. You ever seen anything like it?""

The barman replies with a shrug.

A prominent orchestra was performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. At one point in the final movement of the symphony, there is a long stretch--over 20 minutes--where the bass violins don't play a note. So, rather than just sit there, the section leader suggested that they sneak out of the orchestra and go across the street to the tavern. The other bass players agreed that this was a splendid idea, and a few minutes later, the basses were in the bar, knocking back drinks at a prodigious rate. 

This went on for some time, with all the bass players becoming rather inebriated. One of them happened to look down at his watch and exclaimed, ""We'd better get back to our seats or we're going to miss our cue!"" 

""Relax,"" said the section leader, ""I've got it all taken care of. You see, before the performance started tonight I anticipated this problem, so I took a piece of string and I tied the conductor's score shut. He won't be able to turn the pages when he gets to that part. He'll have to stop the orchestra for a few minutes so he can get it untied. We'll have plenty of time!"" 

The other bass players praised his inventiveness with one final round of drinks. Then they made there way back across the street to the concert hall, and staggered drunkenly to their seats. Sure enough, about this time the conductor started to have trouble with his score. He tried to fidget with it, hoping he could solve the problem without having to stop the performance. Unfortunately, he couldn't get the pages to turn, and at last he had to stop the orchestra and spend a few minutes untying the string that held the last section of the score bound. The conductor was clearly annoyed and not a little frazzled. 

This, of course, did not go unnoticed by the audience. One woman in the crowd remarked to her husband, ""That conductor looks upset and rather nervous."" ""Of course he's nervous,"" the husband replied. ""It's the bottom of the Ninth, the score is tied, and the basses are loaded.""",Must have been the Irish orchestra.,10

“Well then, you can come with me to my house and I’ll feed you,” the lawyer said.

He had arrived on the farm in the morning, and was looking at himself proudly as the old rooster of the farm (the only other male of the species in the vicinity) came to him.

The old rooster said, ""See, boy, this is my farm. I challenge you to compete. If you win, you rule the farm. Fair enough?"" The young rooster obviously agreed. So the old rooster explained, ""I will start from this line, and reach master's porch. Since I am much old, I will have 3 second's handicap. After 3 seconds, you will start. If you could bite my crown before I reach the porch, you win.""

""1... 2... 3..."" And young rooster started full speed at the oldie. As he shortened the distance, the old one started to shout out loud strange quaking sounds and ran here and there, young rooster closely following and trying to bite his crown.

""BANG...."" A rifle shot from the porch. Farmer rested his rifle on his shoulder, and looking down to the dead young rooster, said, ""Damn... What's wrong with them...? This is the third rooster I bought in a row, and every single one of them was homosexual!""",The old rooster,17

The old lady replied, ""No, I came here for something else that I think you might enjoy doing.""

Bank president, ""What might that be?""

Old lady, ""I would like to make a wager with you.""

Bank president, ""What is the wager?""

Old lady, ""The wager is this, that by this friday your balls will be square after working all day.""

Bank president says laughing, ""Are you serious?""

Old lady, ""Yes and I am willing to bet one million dollars cash that by friday at 6pm your balls will be square.""

Bank president, ""Alright, I will take that bet,"" thinking to himself he will never make that much money so easily.

The little old lady says, ""Well then I will see you on friday shortly before 6pm.""

Bank president says ""See you then.""

Once the old lady leaves, the bank president tells his secretary to cancel all his appointments for the rest of the week and he then leaves and tells her that he will return friday as usual.

Friday comes and the bank president is confident that he will win the bet as his balls are not square but just in case he is very careful not to do anything that might change their shape.

The little old lady arrives a few minutes before 6pm and with her is a gentleman carrying two briefcases.  The bank president greets her and she introduces the gentleman as her attorney and witness to the conclusion of the wager.

The bank president tells the old lady, ""My balls are not square so I win the bet!""

The old lady replied, ""Mind if I do a physical examination?""

The bank president said, ""Sure, I will allow you to do that for a million dollars,"" and drops his pants and underwear.  

The little old lady, just before 6pm gently takes the bank presidents balls in her hands and confirms they are indeed not square.

Her attorney begins to cry.  Confused, the bank president asks, ""Why is your attorney crying?""

The little old lady replied, ""I bet him 10 million dollars that by 6pm today I would have the president of the National Bank &amp; Trust by the balls.

A young man wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived  far away from him. He consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. Off he went with his sister to the shops and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. The shop had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and the man unknowingly got the knickers. He sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter. 
Dear Maggie 
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. 
I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.
When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.
Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.
All my love,
Patrick 
P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",[NSFW] A joke my dad told me,41

As it turned out, there was a surprise call for a General Election and their mid-week wedding day coincided with the eve of polling day itself. Which was all very well, but at the reception they got into a furious argument about politics, and by the time they got to the hotel, they weren't on speaking terms. Fuming, they both got changed and into bed and turned the lights out.

But after a while she started to think that this was a waste of their one and only wedding night, and she nudged her bridegroom and whispered ""Darling, there's a split in the Labour Party, and if the Conservative member stood now, he'd get in easily.""

When he got to the bookstore he was disappointed, for there was a very long line but since, he decided all the other places he wanted to go to would have even longer lines, he just decided to suck it up and wait in line for his books.

After a bit of reading however, he noticed his stomach was growling, he was even hungrier and thirstier than before! He guessed he would have to get some food. When he got there, sadly, There was a very long line for the restaurant. however he didn’t really want to go home and get food because he was already here so he just decided to wait in line.  After what seemed like hours the line ended, he was able to grab a seat, order food, and basically inhale it. 

After eating he headed back outside to read a bit more but discovered he was super thirsty, ever thirstier from before because he knew the juice store must have had huge lines all day and would probably have long lines now, too. However He decided he really didn’t wanna wait in any more lines but he was craving juice and thirsty as hell. So, he headed on down to the juice store.

They said, ""Don't bring us anything but something witty said by a person from Isfahan.""

The guy promised he would remember their request. So, he went to the city and had a great time there. While he was on his way back to some station in a taxi, it occurred to him that he had forgotten to ask a guy for some joke or puzzle.

""What bothers you?"" Asked the taxi driver, sensing trouble.

""My pals asked me to bring them some Isfahani joke but it seems I totally forgot about it.""

""What's the big deal?"" Driver consoled him. ""I'm from Isfahan. Let me tell you a witty puzzle. Answer this: Who is my father's son but is not my brother?""

The hapless fellow thought for a few moments and then admitted he was at loss to answer.

""That would be me."" Driver said with a smirk. ""I am my father's son but I am not my brother.""

The townsman laughed at the joke and was pleased with it. At the end of the journey, he asked the driver for his name.

""My name is Ali Hassan."" Told the taxi driver.

Once home, he gathered all his friends and asked them the same question.

""Who is my father's son but is not my brother?""

All friends failed to answer. The guy smiled. With a prideful glance at the gathering of his fellows, he revealed the puzzle's solution.

To which she replied"" these are my gambling winnings"". 

To prove it she challenged him to a bet. ""I bet $10,000 that your testicles are square.""
The man quickly agreed realizing that there was no way his balls were square.
They agreed to meet at Monday in two days to see if his testicles are square.

On Monday the woman walked in and saw the beaming man. The man had spent all night making sure his testicles weren't square and he knew that this was easy money for him.

""I brought a lawyer to witness the whole thing"" the woman said.
The man did not protest. The woman called a man to come inside. And in walked a young man in his twenties.

The woman then asked if the manager could show her his balls. He took off his pants showing his round balls.
She asked if she could touch them just to be sure.

 The man agreed thinking it to be a small price for $10,000. The woman after several minutes of touching his testicles stepped back and smiled 
She admitted her loss and gave him the money.

Meanwhile the manager noticed the lawyer banging his head on the wall. 
Curious, he asked "" what is he doing?"".

Smiling, She replied, "" I bet him that in $100,00 that in 2 days I would have the manager of the bank by the balls, and he'd even be happy about it.""

post,eay8ae,2qh72,jokes,false,1576411531,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eay8ae/a_man_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,,"He goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.

The bartender says, ""Sure, I'll take a bet. What's your action?""

The man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. The bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.

Laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. ""Double or nothin' says I can bite my other eye.""

The bartender thinks it over. He knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.

The man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.

Now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. Just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.

""Real sorry about that, pal. I get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so I'll give you another chance to win some cash. I've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, I can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. This is kinda hard for me to do, though, so I think it's fair if you give me two chances at it.""

The bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. Especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. After a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.

The man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, ""Go!"" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.

The man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. However, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.

Catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. Once again, he shouts, ""Go!"" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar.

Once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. However, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass.

Head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.

All of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams ""Fuck!"" at the top of his lungs.

The bartender mutters aloud, ""I wonder what his problem is.""

To which the man replies, ""Oh, I just bet that guy $10,000 that I could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy.""",A man walks into a bar,514

""$15.""

He asks, ""Hey how much to the airport?""

Driver responds, ""$15.""

""God, lord look at that chick, she's a pretty fine petite: just the way you like it. You don't want to miss this chance. Now you go say hi to each other, get to know each other, and even have a little fun. ""

I thought to myself that he was right. I might as well especially since I already got my eyes on her.

So he introduced me to her, leaving both of us off in quite an awkward situation.

We talked a bit, got to know each other piece by piece. We then started dancing and laughing throughout the party, enjoying what felt like the night of our lives. Eventually, I was able to take that sweet baby back home, finishing what an amazing that night was.

Amanda has been anticipating a marriage proposal from Bill ever since their 4th year of dating each other, but she felt too shy to ask about it. Amanda thought to herself, ""After 6 years of dating and he hasn't asked me to marry him? I wonder if he even loves me any more."" Amamda, feeling too awkward to ask Bill directly, decides to send a text that says, ""Do you truly love me or have you just been playing with my feelings all these years. We've been together for 6 years, but you haven't asked me to marry you!"" Bill looks at Amanda and is about to say something, but realizing that Amanda is feeling awkward about it instead sends a text saying, ""Of course I love you Amanda. I can't express myself properly because I feel shy about it."" Bill also sends a link as well hoping that Amanda will open it. Upon seeing the link, Amanda taps on the link:

While Rudolph and his life partner Gary were there, they spotted a fortune teller on the other side of the street. As the pair crossed the road, a truck carrying industrial red naval paint swerved to narrowly avoid a collision with them. The truck hit a telephone pole and red paint flew *everywhere*. Luckily, the two were safely under an awning and avoided the glittery red paint. 

They walked into the fortune teller's shop and asked if they could receive their fortunes. The teller, an old woman who graduated from Penn, told Greg's fortune first. She held his palm in hers and told him he'd know fame and fortune. She said that someone very near to him would become world renowned and that they'd travel the world together. 

Next up, was Rudolph. The old teller took a look at him and realized she had a dilemma. Poor Rudolph had hooves instead of hands, so she could not read his palm. 

So she red his nose.","Everyone knows how Bert the Brown Nose reindeer got his name, but nobody knows how Rudolph did",7

The old man was a master at his craft, and we routinely had orders from ultra-rich clients looking to have extra-fancy furniture custom made to their specifications.

One day Walt decides that I'm ready to do a complete project on my own, all the way from planning to finished product. So he sends me to the front desk with instructions to take the order from the next client to come in, and that he won't intervene unless I find that I'm in over my head and explicitly ask for help.

So eventually this lady walks through the door, and she has this very distinctive appearance, long curly hair dyed in all the colors of the rainbow under a brown cowboy's hat, leather boots over skin-tight jeans, and a flannel shirt. Absolutely stunning. And she turns to me and says:

""I'm opening an exclusive pub that will cater to a very specific clientele: only pairs, triplets, and so on of identical twin sisters, and only if they're all lesbians. I have almost everything I need, save for the countertop itself. I need it to be this long and this wide (it's been a few years, I have forgotten the exact measurements - OP), at least 1.5 inch thick, with the edges carved Ogee over Half Bullnose, and I want it made out of..."" She took a moment to consider, looking at our selection of sample boards, ""This gorgeous red wood. Can you make that for me?""

""Just a moment ma'am, I need to check."" Of course I wanted to say yes, but I wasn't sure that the type of wood she'd chosen would be safe to use in an establishment that serves food and drink. So I turned around and asked my boss:

""Walt, would yew do for a cloned dyke bar?""",I used to work as a carpenter's apprentice,20

He did the only thing he could think of - grabbed the grenade and threw it as far away as he could. It landed in an old abandoned outhouse and exploded, knocking a few boards off the walls and causing a lot of smoke. 

As everyone stared in shock, a figure materialized in the smoke. Grandpa emerged from the outhouse, beard singed, flaming toilet paper trailing from one foot, and half a smoking newspaper in one hand.

Didn't you complete elementary school? I'm starting to doubt that, to be truthful to you. Doesn't concern me if you fail this class, it doesn't affect me. Not my problem, yours. That's my way of putting it.

Kicking back in class isn't an option for you, you need to focus. I'm writing an email to your parents, so they can help you at home. Last time I emailed them they were quite respectful and cooperative, so don't expect to get away with anything this time. Lately, you've been absent from classes, and that can't happen anymore.

Hilariously you've been successful in all your classes, so why are you choosing to fail this one? I know that you're a smart kid, but why don't you like English class? Many times in class you're doing other class' work or sleeping, and you have to stop doing that as well. So when you get home, I want you to go practice and study because we have a test soon and you've failed all your previous tests this year. Every single time, you get an F, it's embarrassing.

Suddenly, the temperature dropped and a furious snowstorm was upon them. They came across an isolated cabin, far removed from any town. The hunters had heard that the locals in the area were quite hospitable, so they knocked on the door to ask permission to rest. 

No one answered their knocks, but they discovered the cabin was unlocked and they entered. It was a simple place ... 2 rooms with a minimum of furniture and household equipment. Nothing was unusual about the cabin except the stove. It was large, potbellied, and made of cast-iron. What was strange about it was its location ... it was suspended in midair by wires attached to the ceiling beams. 

""Fascinating,"" said the psychologist. ""It is obvious that this lonely trapper, isolated from humanity, has elevated this stove so that he can curl up under it and vicariously experience a return to the womb."" 

""Nonsense!"" replied the engineer. ""The man is practicing the laws of thermodynamics. By elevating his stove, he has discovered a way to distribute heat more evenly throughout the cabin.""

 ""With all due respect,"" interrupted the theologian, ""I'm sure that hanging his stove from the ceiling has religious meaning. Fire LIFTED UP has been a religious symbol for centuries."" The three debated the point for several hours without resolving the issue. 

When the trapper finally returned, they immediately asked him why he had hung his heavy potbellied stove from the ceiling. His answer was succinct. ""Had plenty of wire, not much stove pipe.""","An engineer, a psychologist, and a theologian were hunting in the wilderness of northern Canada.",34
