post,4tyggg,2qh72,jokes,false,1469125766,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4tyggg/greg_and_edna_and_a_snow_blower_mildly_racist/,self.jokes,,"A man and his wife, Greg and Edna, were lived in Barrow, Alaska their entire lives. One day, after a particularly heavy snowfall – more than 30 inches! – Greg turns to Edna while they’re clearing their driveway and proclaims to his wife “Edna, I’ve had enough of this snow. We’ve shoveled and scraped and salted and blowed for 50 years. We’re going south, and we’re not stopping until we find a place where no one knows what this damn thing is” as he gestures at his snow blower. So the next day they pack their clothes and valuables, and Edna helps Greg strap the snow blower to the roof of their car, and they begin driving south.

Eventually, after many, many hours of driving, the pair reaches Vancouver, British Columbia. It’s sunny and bright, with a warm breeze blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. It seems like a lovely place. As they pull into a gas station to refill their car Edna asks “Is this where we’re going to live?”

But before Greg can answer, a man walks up to Greg’s open window.
“Hey there” the man says “that’s a nice snow blower you got there. Is it for sale or something?”

Greg turns to Edna and shakes his head “No honey, this isn’t the place.”

So the pair starts driving again. Their next pit stop is in Medford, Oregon. The relatively small city is nice and warm, and it’s known for being sunnier and drier than other parts of the Pacific North-West.

“This seems like a lovely spot” Edna says. “Is this where we’re going to live?”

But Greg shakes his head and points to the display of anti-freeze and windshield scrapers just inside the gas station’s doors. “They still have winters here. I’m afraid this isn’t the spot.”

They continue driving for what seems like an eternity, passing through San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, and many other towns and cities along the way, until eventually they reach Kingsville, Texas. Exhausted from their long journey, Greg and Edna pull into a small gas station to fuel up. The attendant comes out and, in a thick southern drawl, says “Well howdy folks. Say, what’s that contraption on top of your car, some kind of wheat thresher?”

Edna looks to Greg with a glimmer of hope in her eyes, and Greg smiles and nods back to her. “This is the place.”

Several months pass and Greg’s brothers Will and Pete decide to pay him a surprise visit and get out of the Alaskan cold for a few weeks. So they hop on an airplane and go to Greg and Edna’s address in Kingsville. As their cab pulls up to the house, they notice the place looks dark and unkempt. Unsure of what to do, they decided to knock on the neighbor’s door and see what they know. When the neighbor answered, Will greeted him.

“Uh, hey there. This is 114 East Shelton, right?”

“It sure is”

“Huh. Well you see, I thought my brother and his wife lived next door to you. But the house seems abandoned.”

“Oh, you must be talking about Greg and Edna” the neighbor replies. “They moved out all flustered and in a hurry a few weeks ago.”

“Really?” Pete asks, somewhat alarmed. “Are they okay? Were they in some kind of trouble?”

“I don’t think so. All I know is, last I saw of them, they we’re driving North as fast as they could with a nigger strapped to the roof of their car.”

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.  I asked him what was wrong; He said, ""nothing."" I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving.  I can't explain his behavior. I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV.  He continued to seem distant and absent.

Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else.

He sits in the parking lot, takes out a paring knife, and unenthusiastically slices up and eats the fruit. He carefully wipes the knife clean with his handkerchief, disposes of the core, and leaves. 



The next day, the man returns. Once again, he stares longingly at the apples, but grabs a pear instead. He slices it up and eats it unhappily in the parking lot. Once he's done, he wipes his knife clean, disposes of the core, and leaves.



He returns again the next day. Again he stares longingly at the apples, buys a pear, and goes out to the parking lot to cut it up and eat it. 



An employee observes the man all three times and decides to approach him. ""Excuse me sir, but I couldn't help but notice you in the produce section these past three days. You look like you really want an apple.""



The man nods slowly as he cuts a slice of fruit and eats it with a slight grimace.



""Yet you buy a pear every time and don't seem to like it at all."" The man nods again. Baffled, the employee continues, ""why don't you buy an apple to eat if you don't like pears?""


The man pulls out his handkerchief and slowly cleans the blade of his paring knife. He lets out a long, sad sigh before he answers. ""I haven't got an appling knife.""

The KKK says, ""a white American! It's one part Bailey's, one part Kentucky bourbon, and one lock of Ted Nugent's beard hair."" The bar keep says, ""oddly enough, we happen to have the beard hair,"" and serves KKK his drink.

Black Lives Matter says, ""I'll have a Sam Jackson. It's one part Hennessy and one part SHUT THE FUCK UP."" The bar keep serves Black Lives Matter a Hennessy without saying a word.

He then turns to Westboro Baptist Church who says, ""I will have a Blind Faith, which is a one ounce shot of full blown HIV AIDS, and be quick about it."" To which the bar keep replies, ""I don't know how you guys found us, but we do in fact have a bottle filled with full blown HIV AIDS.

The bar keep serves the drink and Westboro Baptist takes it down in one gulp, slaps the wooden bar top with his palm and says, ""and I'll have another.""
The bar keep hesitates somewhat uncomfortably, conflicted with whether he should comply. 

Ever astute, Westboro Baptist can see how the bar keep feels from his face and says, ""oh ye of little faith. You judge me but do not know me or understand my beliefs. While I am a man of God, I am still a creature of the modern times. So I assure you no harm will come to me.""

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.
 
Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.  She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. 
 
He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.  Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great.  You should go into town and kick up your heels."" 
 
The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. 

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her.

""Unbutton my blouse  and take it off,"" she said. 

Trembling, he  did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots."" 

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.

""Now  take off my socks.""

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. 

""Now take off my skirt."" 

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. 

""Now take off my bra."" 

Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped 
it to the floor. 

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.""

He buys his ticket, and tries to walk inside without being seen. Right when he thought he had made it through, a security guard caught him and asked to check his belongings.

The man reluctantly hands over his bag to the security guard.

Security: ""Alright what do we have here... a Colt 1911, an AK-47, some frag grenades... everything seems to be in order. Enjoy your movie sir.""

Man: ""Alright, thank you. Have a nice day.""

The security guard begins to turn back to his post when he notices a slight bulge in the man's duffel bag that he had not seen before. He calls out to the man, telling him to stop.

The man breaks into a sprint, hoping to out maneuver the guard and get to his movie. He ran as fast as he could, but was unable to outrun the security guard. He's tackled to the ground, and the guard calls for back up.

As more guards arrive to restrain the man, the guard looks into the duffel bag once more. He ends up pulling out a bag of cocaine. 

Security:""This is why you ran? What was the point? There's no harm done having this on you, it's just some illegal drugs.""

Man:""Well, you see... I was planning on taking the drugs and using them to get super high. Once I was high, I would take the weapons in my bag and kill everyone in the movie theater.""

Security:""Why though?""

She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, ""It's a lot of money!""

After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president's office(the customer is always right!)

The bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit. She replied, ""$165,000!"" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk.

The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, ""Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?""

The old lady replied, ""I make bets.""

The president then asked, ""Bets? What kind of bets?""

The old woman said, ""Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.""

""Ha!"" laughed the president, ""That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!""

The old lady challenged, ""So, would you like to take my bet?""

""Sure,"" said the president, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!""

The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. as a witness?""

""Sure!"" replied the confident president.

That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.
The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!""

The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.

The president did.

The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.

""Well, Okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""

Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.

The President asked the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

She replied, ""Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 a.m. today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.""",A little old lady went into the Bank of Canada,167

He finds that there is a different hell for each country.

He goes to Germany Hell and asks, 'What do they do here?' ... He is told 'first they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the German devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day'. The man does not like the sound of that at all so he moves on.

He checks out the USA Hell as well as the Russia Hell and many more. He discovers that they are all similar to the German hell.

Then he comes to the BOTSWANA Hell and finds that there is a long line of people waiting to get in. Amazed, he asks, 'What do they do here?'

He is told 'first they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. The BOTSWANA devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day.

'But, that is exactly the same as all the other hells why are there so many people waiting to get in?' asks the man.

Because there is never any electricity, so the electric chair does not work. The nails were paid for but never supplied, so the bed is comfortable to sleep on. And the BOTSWANA devil used to be a civil servant, so he comes in; signs his time sheet and goes back home for private business.'

""Two hundred dollars? Whoo wee man,  that's hard to pass up.  If you like this mule that much then,  okay fella.  We got ourselves a deal.""


The new owner pays for the mule and leads it to his place and immediately hooks him up to a plow.  The mule is doing great. Straight, deep row - until he gets to the end of the first row where he just keeps on walking. The man is hollering at the mule and tugging the reins but the mule keeps walking right through the fence,  a huge briar patch, and a gulley before the new owner can get him turned around. 


Wondering if his neighbor sold him a blind mule,  he walks in front of it, waves his hands in front of the mule's eyes and realizes, sure enough - it's blind as a bat. 


Pissed off, he immediately  drags the mule straight back to the man who sold him the mule.  


""Man.  We have a problem. You sold me a blind mule. This thing is blind as a bat! He dragged me all the way through the woods and into a huge gulley before he finally stopped.  Then I realized he can't see a *thing*! He's blind as a bat. I demand my money back this instant or you'll be hearing from my attorney!""

""Afternoon, sirs. Welcome to the Egg Emporium, the premier distributor of eggs and egg products in town. How can I help you?""

""I don't know eggxactly what you're talking about, but I can show you the back, if you'd like to see."" ""Yes, that'd be helpful.""

The second detective grimaces at the first; they could be walking into a trap. There had been an anonymous call that the emporium had been the center of a sex trafficking operation, and who knows what could be behind those doors. 

The back rooms contained shelves upon shelves of eggs; duck, chicken, ostrich, emu, crocodile, alligator, Obama. Yolk was strewn about the floor, presumably from dropped eggs. The employees ran around in chicken suit uniforms, though the detectives attributed this to an odd company policy. 

""And here we are at the last room. Before you enter, I'd ask that you remember that what we're doing is perfectly legal."" said the man, standing proud in his rooster costume. ""What do you mean 'doing'?"" ""You'll see.""

The door opened. 

A naked man lay in the middle of the floor, surrounded by various fowl-dressed men.

She replies, ""okay, meet me after class and we'll settle it."" 

But before class ends, she goes to the restroom and removes her panties. After class is over and the students clear out, Johnny makes his guess. ""Blue."" 

""Nope. You got it wrong,"" she says as she lifts her skirt to reveal she isn't wearing any underwear. 

""Well come with me out to my dads car, he's waiting for me, and I'll get you the money."" She follows him out. When they get to the car she informs his dad that he got the bet wrong and that she showed Johnny that she wasn't wearing any underwear.

Every day he would get driven to school on a tractor, and his dad would always pick him up on a tractor. Whenever christmas came around, he would always wish for tractor toys, miniatures, and pretty much anything that was related to tractors, and during birthdays he would get tractor shaped cakes. His life was full of tractors, and he couldn't get enough of them. 

When the boy was around the age of 15 he started getting really interested in girls. There was this cute girl at school that he liked,  but he didn't have the courage to ask her out. He went home to his dad and told him he needed to stop being so obsessed with tractors, because no girl would ever like him if all he cared about was tractors. The dad decided to take the boy to therapy. It took a long time with multiple visits, but eventually the boy managed to get rid of his obsession with tractors. The boy decided that he wanted to ask the cute girl from school out on a date. He built up all the courage he could, and asked her out. She said yes! The boy was very happy, and later the same day he had already reserved a table at a restaurant for them to eat at. 

The big day was here. The boy and girl were sitting at their table at a nice restaurant, waiting for their food. The boy was really happy, but the girl seemed a bit upset. 

""What's wrong?"" the boy asked.   
""Nothing much, I love this place but it's a bit smoky in here"" she replied

The boy stood up, emptied his lungs, and cleared the room of smoke in one breath. 

The girl was amazed. ""Wow, how did you do that?"", she asked.   
The boy replied:

""I am an extractor fan""",There was this little boy who was obsessed with tractors...,197

he says to his wife, ""do you know why those boys are playing cricket and not having sex with older married women?""

the wife is surprised at this question because that was exactly what was in her mind.  ""no darling.  tell me why?""

""because"", says the sardar, ""they have two penises!""

the wife is shocked, but she looks at her husband and he seems really serious, so she decides to believe him.

then the sardar goes down to talk to the boys.  the topic immediately goes to sex.  the sardar feigns disappointment.  ""i thought that marriage will mean that i will have lots of sex.  but alas, it is impossible to have sex with my wife.""

""what?!"" the boys exclaim, ""why is it impossible?""

""because"", says the sardar, ""my wifes vagina has a hand inside it.  and the only time i tried to have sex with her, that hand grabbed my penis and almost ripped it off.""

the boys are shocked, but the sardar looks completely serious so they decide to believe him.

the next day, the sardars wife is alone and standing in the gallery watching the boys.  the boys look up to her, and she beckons them to come in her house.  now the boys are completely scared but they are also keen to have sex, so they come up with a plan.  one boy volunteers to go in, with some rope tied around his waist.  then he would make some excuse and come out to the gallery to throw the other end of the rope out.  and if he would tug on the rope, they other boys are supposed to pull him out.

all that is done and the wife is naked and the boy is about to go in.  the sardars wife thinks, since these boys have two penises, i will just reach down and grab one penis.  so she reaches down and grabs the boys penis.

the boy thinks that the hand inside the vagina has come out to rip off his penis, and frantically starts tugging at the rope, and his buddies pull him out of there.

the sardar was able to ensure that his wife does not fuck around.

Upon arrival he is ushered into a long queue of people to be judged for his sins. He says to the usher, ""I'm the Pope, I don't need to be judged."" The usher just shakes his head and pushes the Pope forwards towards the back of the line. 

The Pope looks ahead and sees that the line is very long. There are about 70 people lining up and each person takes roughly 10 mins before they are let free. Thinking he's going to be waiting for a number of hours, he has a bright idea and walks up to the front of the queue. 

Not wanting to be too greedy he speaks to the person third in line from the front. He says, ""I'm the Pope, let me stand in front of you."" The man replies with, ""Sorry I'm a Christian, I don't recognise the authority of the Pope."" 

Not giving up hope the Pope goes and asks the same question to the second person in line. The man is from a lost tribe deep within the Amazon forests. The tribesman replies with, ""What's a Pope?"" 

Still not giving up, the Pope goes to the man at the front of the line. Thankfully, the man is a staunch Catholic and gladly lets the Pope stand in front of him.

A few minutes later the Pope is called up to the front. A man speaking on behalf of God says ""You are about to be judged for the sins you have committed from being born up until you stepped forward towards me."" ""We use a points system, accumulate less than a certain number of points and you will go to heaven."" ""Accumulate too many points and you will go to hell for eternity."" The Pope thinks to himself 'I'm the Pope, of course I'm going to heaven.' The man speaks again, saying, ""The verdict is.... Unfortunately, you are going to hell."" The Pope retorts with ""No, no, there must be a mistake. I'm the Pope, if anything I should be the first person to go to heaven."" The man shakes his head apologetically and says ""I'm sorry but you exceeded the number of points by 1. If you had committed one less sin you would have gone to heaven."" Continuing, the man says, ""I'll read out some of the sins you committed. One was not greeting an archbishop when he opened a door for you. Another, ordering the Vatican toilet block to be out of bounds while you did your business there in peace. A third, excommunicating a priest when he took your parking space."" 

The Pope then asks, ""Well what was the last sin I committed to get me that one extra point?""
The man replies with, ""Cutting in to the front of this queue.""

""So, who are you?"", asked the bartender.

""I'm a danceologist. I've studied every dance in the entirety of Oceania"".

""Even the Wingo Wango?""

""Mhm"", he replied.

""Even the Yapucha dance?"", he asked.

""Wait, I've never heard of that one! Can you tell me about it?""

The bartender shook his head. ""I can't, but my cousin lives in Darwin. Here's his address. The bartender handed him a business card. The danceologist thanked him, and booked a flight there. When he arrived at the airport, the cousin greeted the danceologist, and took him home.

""Every year on the 12^th of May they do the dance. You see that mountain up there? They live on top. They'll be doing it in 2 weeks.

The danceologist looked at the mountain in awe. Two weeks later, there was a heavy storm. There were collapsing, jagged rocks, and the icy winds battered him. He didn't bring any oxygen, and so he felt too out of breath, and took a rest. Later, he carried on for one last push, and reached the top, where he met the tribe.

""Aha! Is this where the Yapucha dance is?"", exclaimed the danceologist.

""Sorry"", said the chief. ""You missed it by twelve minutes"".

""WHAT?!"", exclaimed the man. ""Can you do it just for me?"", he asked.

""Sorry again"", said the chief. ""It would upset the Gods. Come back next year at 12 o' clock""

Distraught, he went down the mountain. He flew back to London, and waited a full year, holding off any other projects so he could practise, even to the point where he spent less time with his family. When the time came, he flew back to Darwin, climbed out the mountain, combatted the chilly winds, fought off aggressive wildlife, only to get hit by a rock on the head. Despite this, he carried on, and reached the top.

""Am I in time?!"", the danceologist panicked.

""Just in time!"", laughed the chief. ""Are we all ready?""

The other tribesmen got into a circle and nodded. The danceologist watched intently.

While he was there, an engineer from the local airport walked in and said to the shopkeeper, ""I'd like a Line Service Monkey, please.""

The clerk nodded, went to a cage at the side of the store and took out a monkey. He put a collar and leash on the animal and handed it to the engineer, saying, ""That'll be $1,000.""

The engineer paid and left with the monkey.

Surprised, the first customer went to the shopkeeper and said, ""That was a very expensive monkey. Most of them are only a few hundred dollars. Why did that one cost so much?""

The shopkeeper answered, ""Ah-----that was a Line Service Monkey. He can park, fuel, and service all types of aircraft, conduct all required ground ops testing, rig aircraft flight controls, and all with no mistakes. He's well worth the money. ""

With his interest peaked, the customer then looked around and spotted a monkey in another cage with a $10,000 price tag. ""That one's even more expensive! What can it do?"" he asked.

""Oh, that one is a Maintenance Supervisor Monkey. He can instruct at all levels of aircraft maintenance, supervise all corrective and preventive maintenance programs, supervise a crew of maintainers, and even do most of the paperwork. A very useful monkey indeed,"" replied the shopkeeper.

The customer continued to look around the shop a little longer and found a third monkey in a cage. The price tag read $50,000.

Reading that, the customer said, ""$50,000!!!! Holy shit, what does this one do?""

""Well"", the shopkeeper said, ""I've never actually seen him do anything but drink beer, screw the girl monkeys, and play with his penis, but his papers say... he's a pilot!""

""Captain, captain, what do we do?"" asked the first mate.

chest, and bring me my red shirt.""  The first mate did so. 

Wearing his bright red shirt, the captain exhorted his crew to 
fight.  So inspiring was he, in fact, that the pirate ship was repelled 
without casualties.  

A few days later, the ship was again approached, this time by two 
pirate sloops!  

""Captain, captain, what should we do?""

""First mate, bring me my red shirt!""

The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and 
managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many 
casualties.  That night, the survivors had a great celebration.  The 
first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt. 

""It's simple, first mate.  If I am wounded, the blood does not 
show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

A week passed, and they were nearing their home port, when 
suddenly the lookout cried that ten ships of the enemy's armada were 
approaching!  

""Captain, captain, we're in terrible trouble, what do we do?""
