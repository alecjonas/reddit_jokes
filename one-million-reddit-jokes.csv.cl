""What I want you to do,"" the man continued, ""is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong.""

So they did. Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them. And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.",There was an old man who lived by a forest,16

The only problem was that he had lost his eye in a fishing accident when he was younger. They were too poor to afford a glass eye, so his father made him a wooden one.

He was made fun of all through school for his eye and it completely destroyed his self esteem.

But he was tired of letting the world get him down. The school dance was coming up and he would be damned if he didn't let himself have a good time.

Johnny liked a girl named Lisa. She was shy and just as lonely as he was, due to having a fairly pronounced mustache, earning her the nickname, ""Hair-lip"".

Well Johnny saw past her stache and thought she was the most beautiful girl in school, and he decided he was going to ask her out. He waited until lunch, and spotted her sitting alone in the corner.

He walked up to her and said, ""Lisa, I've been seeing you around for a while, and, well... Would you like to go to the dance with me?""

Lisa's eyes lit up and she said, ""Would I!""

Johnny said, ""Hair-lip!"" and walked away.","Johnny was a bright, charming boy",13

He gets off the ship, unloads his gear, and sets out deeper into the land. In his Jeep, he rides through a savannah, evading lions as good as he can. 

The terrain then slowly changed to a sandy desert, through which his car hardly moves forward through the loose sand.

Then he reaches a green valley with easily traversible ground, where a whole buch of animals live. He stops to refill his waterflasks, he drank most of it in the desert. He then sees some hippos, so he decides it is best to continue on his journey.

Following the valleys' river upstream, he reaches a jungle. The jungle is too dense to drive through, so he decides to continue on foot. He packs essentials survival gear in his backpack and walks on.
Then he reaches a waterfall, which falls down from a steep, 30 metres high cliff. He finds no other way to climb the waterfall then to just scale the cliff itself, so he ever so slowly but gradually makes his way to the top, with each step taken with the outermost care so he does not fall down.

After traversing a bit more dense jungle, he comes across an ancient rope bridge. It looks very fragile but after he put a bit of pressure on the first planks, he determines it is safe enough to cross. Carefully, he walkes over the bridge, struggling to keep his balance whilst not stepping down to hard on the planks.

At the end, he is greeted by an ancient, overgrown pathway, which leads to what he has been searching for: the Monkeys' Temple.

He approaches the centuries-old building, and manages to open its gate ever.... so.. slowly....

Once he puts his head around the corner, he is face to face with King Kong!

Scared to bits, he quickly manages to close the gate and books it, with the gorilla coming straight after him! He runs over the old bridge, where he feels some planks breaking under his feet, but he gets across. King Kong merely needs to step over the ravine, and gets across with no effort. The explorer runs to the waterfall, and climbs down as quickly as possible. Half-falling he gets down unharmed, whereas King Kong leisurely jumps down and lands on two feet. Mesn while the man os sprinting through the jungle, where he can hear King Kong stamping behind him, snapping trees left and right. 
Once he gets to his Jeep, the explorer quickly tries to start the car, and once it started, he drives away as quick as possible! With 50 km/h, he races through the valley, but King Kong easily keeps up, and is still only 20 metres behind him! He accelerates to 70 km/h, but King Kong easily jogs after him! Going as fast as 100 km/h over the grass, King Kong is effortlessly running behind him, showing no sign of tiring. Once the explorer gets to the desert, his car has lightened a lot because of all the fuel he burned and with speed he had he almost flies over the soft sand, leaving huge clouds of sand behind him, but they do not bother King Kong, he keeps chasing. As the explorer reaches the savannah, he can start seeing the coast, he pulls up to the beach, but the ship is gone! With nowhere to go, he stops, and Kong quickly grabs him out of his car.

He pulls him up, holds him in front of his huge face, lifts his other hand to him, and says...

He held out a hand with a shiny penny in it. He asked if I could see a snake.   I said no.  He said it was a Copperhead.

He added another penny and asked if I could see a fruit.  I could not, and he said it was a Pear.

He added a third penny and asked if I could see a car.  I stare at the three pennies to no avail.  I could not.  He said it was a Lincoln.  (D'oh!)

He adds a fourth penny and asks if I can see a naked lady.  Now I'm trying to work it out in my head, trying to figure any puns or word play looking at the four pennies.  After a moment, I admit my defeat and tell hem I could not see a naked lady.

With this in mind, one should say, ""Jokes are like frogs, if you vivisect them, they die.""
See what I did there? I took the common phrase of ""Jokes are like frogs, if you dissect them, they die"" and I vivisected it.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair . The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,27

Anyhow, as he crosses a junction in the road a car came flying out and t-boned him good. ‘Christ sake’ he thought to himself, ‘I’m just getting over losing my woman and just about getting my shit together and now this!’ “Well at least I’m not hurt” he thought to himself.
So he gets out to see if the other driver was alright and to start setting about swapping insurance details and what have you. When a brilliant beautiful blonde woman climbs out her wrecked car. She had everything, perfect hair, a body to die for and legs that went all the way up.  He was stunned, barely able to cobble together a smooth sentence. After a few stutters he asked “are you ok?” To which she says “yes I am thankfully”. They start chatting and really hit it off, he tells her he’s just broken up with his love of his life, just about getting his head sorted and going to watch a movie etc. She has a similar story and now she’s clearly very interested in him and he has now forgotten about his lost love at this point. 
She turns to him and says, “do you believe in fate?” He thinks ‘well, I’m starting to!’ He replies “absolutely!” So l she continues to say “well, I believe in fate, I believe that this was meant to happen! In fact I was just on my way to my sisters with a fine bottle of wine to enjoy with her but she blew me off, so I was on the way to go home, it’s a very fine expensive wine and I happen to have two of the best fine cut crystal glasses to go with it. Say, due to us meeting out of fate and as we walked away from this terrible car accident, why don’t we raise a glass to celebrate whilst we wait for the tow trucks and to get sorted. And who knows can maybe continue and have dinner together tonight?!?”
‘God’ he thought...’my lucks in hear!’ Absolutely he eagerly agreed. So she looks in the back of the car and sure enough as fate would have it the fine bottle of wine and two crystal cut glasses are intact and undamaged, she looks at him with a cheeky glint and says “would you look at that, unbroken!” So she pops the cork pours them both a drink. They clink the glasses and he takes a huge swing. So they carry on with small talk, he drinks the glass and she promptly tops him up. He gets though around half the bottle before he notices that’s she had not taken a single sip yet. He finishes laughing at her witty joke and politely asks “are you not going to have any wine with me”
“God, no!” She laughs “I’m gonna wait until police have been”.",So there was this recently separated guy...,9

They approach the girl in their truck and decide to get out. They start flirting with the girl, talking over each other so they can win her over when suddenly an old beat down truck shows up. Leaving his vehicle, the girls father approached the young boys. He looks at them and says ""If you want to get with her you're gonna have to impress me with a difficult task."" 

This catches the attention of the boys, and they ask for further instructions on what they had to do. The farmer looks at them and says ""I want you boys to go out and bring back the most pong balls. Whoever brings back the most ping pong balls can have her."" 

So the boys are off, all heading in their separate directions. 30 minutes pass and one of the boys shows up with a bucket full of ping pong balls. 
""Pretty good"" the father says ""but we gotta wait for the others. 

Another 50 minutes go by when the second boy shows up with a dumpster full of ping pong balls. 

""Very nice! But there's still two other boys we have to wait on."" 

3 hours pass before the third boy shows up and he has a whole semi truck full of ping pong balls. ""Holy cow!"" The farmer exclaims ""I've never seen so many ping pong balls in my life! You definitely did better than those other two but there is still one more boy to wait for."" 

9 hours pass and the father is getting impatient when suddenly the fourth boy shows up, bloodied and beaten. His clothes were ripped and he looks absolutely mauled. 

""What the hell happened?!"" The father asked concerned.

""Well"" starts the boy "" I found that island and I decided to go for it. I started swimming across the way and made it to the island. I looked up in the tree and saw that ape...""

Behind the second hearse, was a solitary Italian man, walking a dog on a leash.

Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking in single file.

The Jewish man couldn't stand the curiosity.

He respectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and said, ""I am so sorry for your loss and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian funeral like this. Whose funeral, is it?""

""My wife's.""

''What happened to her?""

""She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.""

He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?""

“My mother-in-law. She came to help my wife and the dog turned on her and killed her also.""

It was a very poignant and touching moment of Jewish and Italian brotherhood.

Silence passed between the two men.

written the word 'penis' in tiny small letters. She turned around, scanned the

class looking for the guilty face. Finding none, she quickly erased it, and

began her class.

The next day she went into the room and she saw, in larger letters, the word

'penis' again on the black board. Again, she looked around in vain for the

culprit, but found none, so she proceeded with the day's lesson.

Every morning, for about a week, she went into the classroom and found the

same word written on the board, and each day it was written in larger letters.

the board, but instead, found the words, ""The more you rub it, the bigger it

Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a mans' penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study was incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didnt really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead",Why the head of the penis is larger than the shaft.,1892

One day, their walk brought them to a swamp, in which the horse started to sink.

The chicken, following the horse's directions, successfully saves the horse from drowning in the swamp. 

Days later, on another walk, they once again happen upon the swamp, and this time, the chicken gets stuck. ""Quick!"" she cries, ""get me out, same as I did you!""

""Fortunately,"" the horse answered, ""I don't need the rope, or the car."" He then proceeded to pull the chicken out by extending his penis out for her to grab onto, thus saving her from sinking in the swamp.

He suddenly spots this bottle which has recently washed up on the beach. It's obvious it's been tossed around for a long time. He picks up the bottle and notices that it still has the cork intact. So, being curious as to what may be inside, he manages to get the cork out and out pops a Genie.

After expressing profound appreciation for having been let out of the bottle, the Genie grants his benefactor the classic, ""one wish"" and it will be yours. Being an avid surfer, it doesn't take him long to say,
""I've always wanted to surf Hawaii, but I get seasick on ships and I'm afraid to fly. Would you build me a bridge to Hawaii?""

The Genie replies: 
""Do you know what you are asking for? Do you know how long the bridge would have to be? Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific! The concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. And the maintenance of that bridge! No, think of another wish.""

The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, 

""I've been on reddit for years now, and love it very much. I Especially love r/jokes, they make me laugh every day, or they use too. The problem is that people keep reposting jokes trying to earn upvotes. And it gets to the point where I have to read the same joke over and over. And it kills me!!! So I wish that there was never a repost joke on r/jokes. That is my wish “

Jack wasn't good at sports. He didn't have many friends. And it seemed like once a week he was getting called into the principal's office for some sort of misbehavior. So John told Jack, in a last ditch effort to get his son to commit to something, that Jack was going to join the school band. Jack protested, but John put his foot down.

Then the next day, John got a call at the office. He answered, ""Hello?"" A voice asked, ""Is this John Robertson?"" ""Yes,"" John said. ""Jack Robertson's father?"" ""...Yes,"" John said, a little worried. ""This is Sam Thompson, I'm the music teacher at Jack's school."" John sighed. ""What has he done now?"" 

""Well,"" Sam said, ""It turns out we have a real Elvis Presley on our hands."" 

It took John a second to register, because it caught him by such surprise. That was maybe the kindest thing anyone had ever said about his son. Despite himself, John felt tears burn behind his eyes, a feeling of fatherly pride bubbling up, possibly for the first time ever. His breath caught for a moment before he asked, ""Really? Jack is--Jack's good at music?"" 

""Oh no no no,"" Sam said, ""He's dead on the toilet.""

John agreed thinking about all those free beers.

So they went to the first bar, drank each 3 beers until the bartender asked for payment. Mike unzipped his pants and John went on to suck on the sausage. They got kicked out directly.

Happy with the result, they went on to the second bar. And John went wild with the sausage at the end. This went on for 4 more bars.

Being kicked out at the 6th bar, both being very drunk, they agreed to walk home. John heard his stomach growling and was very hungry.

""That's pathetic you old has-been,"" says the second horse. ""I once went an entire year getting first place in all my races!""

""You think that's impressive?"" says the first horse. ""Why I've gotten first place so many times I have lost track!""

The three horses continue to argue, loudly at that. Nearby is an old greyhound trying to take a nap. Fed up with all the senseless bickering, he jumps up and yells at the horses.

""Hey!"" the old dog yells. ""I'll have you know that I raced for a very, very long time and I didn't once lose a single race! I ran and I sweat and bled until I couldn't anymore. I went out on top, so do you think maybe I deserve half an hour of shut-eye?""

All three horses stare at him in stunned silence, trading glances of surprise until the first horse pipes up.

Teller: Very well, I accept your payment of $1000,- with an additional $5,- as interest. If you pay off the total of $1005,- , then you will get your car keys back. 

The blonde and the teller exchange the money for the car keys. Before the blonde walks off, the teller asks her one last question. 

Teller: Excuse my curiosity, but why did you leave your car for security in exchange of that small amount of money?

He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice. When he said he wanted to shave, the council-men were shocked. One said, ""Do you not remember the ancient legend, dire? The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware."" Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale.

He was headstrong, so went ahead and cut and scraped away his magnificent beard. As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up. It lasted only a few seconds, and when it cleared there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader.

The council then knew the legend must be true. Their conclusion? ""A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.""","In the great desert lived a bunch of nomads. Their leader, Benny, had risen to his rank due to his magnificent beard.

The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

And God saw it was good.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God, again saw it was good.

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed it was good.

On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back,
the ten the monkey gave back,
and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God, ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.

For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.

For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. 

And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.

The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.

The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump. 

The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this.""

Nearby were 7 more dead gators all lying belly up. The shopkeeper watched in amazement as the blonde struggled with the gator. Then, rolling her eyes, she screamed in frustration........

When the health inspector came to check the kitchen he immediately shut it down and called to fire the cook. Apparently, they ran out of chicken stock many weeks ago and the cook was using laughing stock to make soup. It wasn't a laughing matter that the headlines of papers went.

post,d94z81,2qh72,jokes,false,1569425778,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d94z81/franz_was_reading_his_book_on_death_row/,self.jokes,,"It was the ‘storm of the century’. On death row, Franz was reading his religious texts, looking for God, even as the inmates of the neighbouring cells were having an explosive argument about who should get to shower first. ’14 days to execution’, Franz thought, as he physically and mentally trembled. If there were ever a time for divine interference, it was now. That was when everything went dark.

‘This must be a power shortage,’ Franz mused to himself. ‘Wait, the backup generators obviously aren’t working either, or maybe just not yet. Maybe the electric doors are unlocked?’ Optimistically, Franz pushed on his cell door, which did give way!

Adrenaline now coursing through his veins, Franz realised that this was it. He got to his feet and ran through multiple corridors, none of which had working doors. Then, he spotted a lone guard running up the corridor, obviously out of breath. With a quick punch and jab, the guard was down on the floor, and Franz snapped his neck with the adroitness of a practiced fighter and killer, which he was after all. The commotion in the rest of the prison, added to the noise of the rain, covered the noise generated by the quick melee.

Searching through the guard’s possessions, Franz was delighted to find not only a wallet, but car keys! After quickly donning the guard’s gear, he ran towards the exit of the prison unstopped by anyone, and drove to his freedom. 300 miles away and in a small town of different state, Franz finally stopped to get what he needed after abandoning the car in the deep woods and taking along a bag-pack. ‘They’ll never find me now,’ he reasoned. It was then that he saw an extremely elegant lady with flaxen hair, walking down the street.

Franz was tall, dark, handsome, and extremely charismatic. Knowing his strengths, he approached the lady, posing as a bag-packer. Over a short but sweet conversation, he convinced the lady, Elise, to let him stay the night at her place. Once the television came on in the morning though, bearing Franz’s mugshot and a ‘shoot on sight’ recommendation, it quickly dawned on Elise that she was harbouring an Eastern-European gangster who was also a wanted serial killer.

‘NO WAY!’ Elise shouted at Franz, as Franz begged her to give him a chance. Ordinarily this would have just meant one more dead body. But over the night, Franz realised that he really loved Elise. Besides, from a pragmatic point of view a dead body popping up in this town would be of no help to himself, especially when the police search was centred 300 miles away.

Using every last drop of his linguistic virtuosity, Franz told Elise the very sad story of a child in a family of gangsters, who was born solely to be a mere pawn in the web of crime lynchpins. He managed to convince Elise to harbour him for just a few days. Those few days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years.

Using a stolen identity, Franz and Elise were able to build a new life together, and enjoy everything that normal couples would. They toured the alpine paradises of Switzerland, and the caverns of Sonora. They enjoyed Italian operas, and American soaps. They engaged in extreme sports, and watched spectator games. But the one thing they shared a particular partiality for was comedy, in all its forms.

After 13 years of sheer unadulterated bliss though, Elise was hit by the sudden discovery that she had late stage cancer, and only a few months to live. The first few days after the revelation were marked with intense anguish and bitterness for the couple. But as they slowly accepted Elise’s cruel fate, the couple were able to push forward and live their lives to the fullest, despite the impending tragedy. Gradually though, Elise’s energy waned, and the couple went from spending their time out rappelling and rock climbing, to spending never-ending nights in the ICU.

One night, as she was coughing up blood, Elise whispered laboriously to Franz, ‘I think this is it. I don’t think I’ll get past tonight. Can you get him to come?’

Franz fumbled for his mobile phone and made a quick phone call. Over the last few months, Franz had managed to get a famous comedian to promise to do a stand-up routine for just himself and Elise, and he was now redeeming the promise he had extracted. After all, humour was the one thing that he shared with Elise most profoundly, and both of them wanted to spend their last day together, enjoying what they loved most.

A mere 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the hospital door. A surprised Franz opened the door, and found himself staring at an entire SWAT team and down the barrels of their guns. In that moment, he knew the game was up. Instantly he fully felt the delayed tiredness of all the last few months.

‘Is it him?’ Elise mumbled from her bed quite hoarsely and inaudibly. And as the last 14 beautiful years flashed in his head, Franz tiredly replied:

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 
One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, David the physician, the King's chief doctor. David thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.
The next day, David made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.
Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, David informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.
The King, eager to help his Queen, quick
