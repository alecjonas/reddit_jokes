He is a salesman at a prominent toothbrush company but can't seem to sell a single toothbrush. 

His boss Frank calls him and his other coworkers into his office for their weekly meeting.

""What is the sales report this week gentlemen?"" Frank asks. 

All of Joes co-workers give their reports, each of them claiming that they sold a few hundred toothbrushes. Frank nods and jots down a few notes as each recites their sales figures. Then he looks to Joe.

""Sssorry sssir. I jusst don't know what'ss going on."" Joe replies.

Frank shakes his head and lowers his notepad. ""Well Joe,"" he begins. ""Upper management is coming down on me. If you don't sell 100 toothbrushes by the end of the month. Your fired.""

Joe sighs but nods, and everybody leaves to go sell toothbrushes.

The next Monday comes and it's the same routine. All of Joes co-workers claiming that they sold more toothbrushes then last week, and Joe stammering that he didn't sell a single one. 

After the meeting as everybody is leaving Frank calls Joe into his office. 

""Look bud, I do not want to fire you. You really need to figure something out though or I am going to have to."" Frank says.

Joe nods, but knows it's futile. 

""Maybe, if you got a slogan, or a stand or a gimmick or something?"" Frank states.

""Gimmick?"" Joe askes ""What the hell is a gimmick?""

""A gimmick! You know, something that attracts attention."" Frank explains. 

Joe thinks for a minute and nods slowly. ""Gimmick. Ok."" 

And he leaves. 

The next Monday Frank calls everybody into the office and goes over the figures as before. Feeling a bit worried, he gets to Joe. 

Frank doesn't say anything, just looks a Joe with a raised eyebrow.

Joe beams a wide grin and states ""One billion""

The notepad in Frank's hand hits the floor as everybody around Joe gasps. 

""H-How?"" Frank stammers.

""Well,"" Joe explains ""I took your adviccce. I got a sstand, with sssome  chipsss and sssome dip and ssetup outside an airport gate. Asss people would leave the plane I would assk 'Would you like sssome chipss?' They would ssay yesss. Then, I would assk 'would you like some dip?' Again, they would ssay yesss. Then, they would take their chip, and dip it in the dip and eat it."" 

Frank waved his hand and Joe, encouraging him to finish the story.

""Then, they would sspit it out and sssay 'agh! Thiss tastesss like ssshit.' Then I ssmile and ssay, thatss causse it is. Wanna buy a toothbrush?""

Bus conductor didn't have guts to ask him to buy ticket or call cops, he was just too afraid of him.

He worked out of 6 months and now he has gained enough weight and mental strength to ask that guy and if deny to take ticket he can pick a fight. Now the day has come to show him the true power of his will, now it was his day.

It went like this:
ABC: Trust me, this company could really use someone new
John: If there is too much work, I'm going to quit...
ABC: We'd NEVER let something like that happen
John: Do employees get every Saturday and Sunday off?
ABC: That's a granted.
John: Are employees required to work overtime without pay?
ABC: No way. Where did you even come up with such a ridiculous idea?
John: Are meals subsidized?
ABC: You BET.
John: Do the new employees usually end up doing ALL the work?
ABC: That's impossible. There are so many other experienced people in our company.
John: If I did well, would I ever become a manager?
ABC: Yes. Absolutely.
John: Wow. Is this for real?
After working there for several months, John noticed that the job wasn't panning out the way he had been promised. Quite upset, he went to file a complaint to the HR dept. The next day, John was summoned into the management's office, where they threatened to fire him for voicing out.

she puts her nine year old son in the closet. One day the woman hears
a car in the driveway and puts her lover in the closet, as well.

Inside the closet, the little boy says, ""It's dark in here, isn't it?
""Yes it is,"" the man replies.

""You wanna buy a baseball?"" the little boy asks. ""No thanks,"" the man
replies.

""I think you do want to buy a baseball,"" the little extortionist
continues. ""OK. How much?"" the man replies after considering the
position he is in. ""Twenty-five dollars,"" the little boy replies.
""TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?!"" the man repeats incredulously, but complies to
protect his hidden position.

The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again when she
hears a car in the driveway and, again, places her lover in the closet
with her little boy. ""It's dark in here, isn't it?"" the boy starts
off.

""Yes it is,"" replies the man.

""Wanna buy a baseball glove?"" the little boy asks.

""OK. How much?"" the hiding lover responds, acknowledging his
disadvantage. ""Fifty dollars,"" the boy replies and the transaction is
completed.

The next weekend, the little boy's father says ""Hey, son. Go get your
ball and glove and we'll play some catch.""

""I can't. I sold them,"" replies the little boy.

""How much did you get for them?"" asks the father, expecting to hear
the profit in terms of lizards and candy.

""Seventy-five dollars,"" the little boy says.

""SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?! That's thievery! I'm taking you to the
church right now. You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness,""
the father explains as he hauls the child away.

At the church, the little boy goes into the confessional, draws the
curtain, sits down, and says ""It's dark in here, isn't it?""

""Don't you start that shit in here now,"" the priest says.",It's dark in here.,5

The local college sends three professors: a structural engineer, a chemical engineer, and a literary critic.

The structural engineer suggests building a concrete dam to stem the river, and the mayor calls in a construction company to do the job.

A week later, the dam is completed, but in a few days the river’s current becomes more intense, and the dam crumbles.

Next, the chemical engineer suggests adding a gelatin solution to the river, to solidify the whole thing.

The mayor calls in a favor with a multinational chemical company, and they deliver a half ton of customized gelatinizing solution.

They add it to the river near the source, and the whole river turns to gelatin.

But a few days later, the current of the river becomes even stronger, and the water pressure at the source starts to break the gelatin apart

Then, out of nowhere, an awful thunderstorm appears over the town. the heavy rain starts to make the river flood.

In a last ditch attempt, the literary critic steps up to the river bank.
He coughs softly, purses his lips, takes a momentary glance at his fingernails, and says “I suppose this river is… adequate.”

And suddenly the flooding stops.

The two other professors rush to the critic’s side and ask, “How the hell did you stop the river from flooding?”

And the critic replies, “Simple. I dammed it with faint praise.”",How to dam a river,2

The witch doctor takes a look at the problem and tells him to go to a particular pond, deep in the forest, and talk to a frog that lives there. ""Ask the frog to marry you and each time the frog says no, you'll be 5 inches shorter."" 
Worth a try, he thinks, and off he dashes into the forest. He finds the pond and sees the frog on the other side, sitting on a log. ""Frog, will you marry me?"" 
The frog looks at him, disinterested at best, and calls back, ""No."" 
The guy looks down and sure enough, he's 5 inches shorter. Hey, this is great he thinks -- let's try that again. ""Will you marry me?"" 
The frog rolls his eyes, and shouts back again, ""No!""

When you're finished, say, 'one, two, three, four' to reverse the effects. This only works once, so use it wisely.""

The man takes his wife to a show and a lovely anniversary dinner, then back home where they get ready for their night of passion. He walks into the bedroom, undresses for her, drinks the potion, and says, 'one, two, three'. In a matter of seconds he's the most well-endowed he's ever been.

A man on the edge of the Sahara desert has to get to a city 6 days away across the desert.  He goes to the camel dealer and asks if he has any camels that can make it that far.  The camel dealer says, ""Yes, I have two six day camels.""  The man selects the best looking one and buys it.  As he leaves, the dealer calls out ""Make sure you fill him all the way up!""
The man takes the camel to the river and lets the camel drink until he can't drink anymore.  Then he sets out across the desert.  After three days, the camel dies of thirst.  The man could have gone either way, but he was really pissed at the camel dealer, so he walked back the way he came, barely surviving the journey.  He stomps up to the camel dealer and yells, ""You son of a bitch!  I paid for a six day camel, and you sold me one that only lasted three days!""  The camel dealer says, ""No, that was a six day camel!  You must not have filled him up all the way!""  The man says, ""I let him drink until he could not drink any more!  He was full!""  The dealer says, ""OK, I think I see the problem.  Come to the river with me and I will show you how to fill a six day camel.""
So the dealer gets the other six day camel and they go down to the river.  The dealer leads the camel to the water and lets him drink his fill.  Just before the camel is done drinking, he sneaks behind the camel and slams the camel's nuts between two rocks.  The camel goes [at this point I have to explain this is a verbal joke, there is a critical sound effect.  Make a surprised groan, but instead of pushing air out past your vocal cords, suck air in as you make the sound.  Try it now so you get it.] ""OOOOOH""
[at this point people laugh and think the joke is over].  
The man says, ""Good God!  Doesn't that hurt?""  The dealer says, ""Not unless you get your fingers between the rocks.""

The Bus Full of Nuns
A bus full of nuns is on its way to Rome to meet the Pope.  A tire blows out and the bus veers off a cliff and falls 500 feet, killing all the nuns instantly.  The nuns wake up and they are in a line in front of Saint Peter's Gate.  The gates are closed, and Saint Peter is standing before the gate.  The first nun steps up to Saint Peter and says, ""I have lived a life devoted to God and I have not sinned.  Let me in!""  Saint Peter replies, ""We have had some sinners dressing up in nun costumes before committing suicide, so you need to pass a test before entering.""  The nun says, ""OK, go ahead.""  Saint Peter asks, ""What was the name of the first man in the Garden of Eden?""  The nun answers, ""That is easy!  It was Adam!""  BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in, and the gates close.  The second nun steps up.  Saint Peter asks, ""What was the name of the first woman in the Garden of Eden?""  The nun answers, ""That is easy!  Her name was Eve!"" BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in, and the gates close.  The third nun steps up.  Saint Peter asks, ""What were the first words Eve said to Adam in the Garden of Eden?""  The third nun is stunned.  She scratches her head, screws up her eyes, then says ""Jesus!  That is a hard one!""  BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in....",The two best jokes I know: The Six Day Camel and The Bus Full of Nuns,1

She started  canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood. She went to the front door of the  first house, and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to  do.

""Well, I guess I  could use somebody to paint my porch,"" he said, ""How much will you charge  me?""

Delighted, the  girl quickly responded, ""How about $50?""

The man agreed and told her that the paint brushes and everything she would need was in the garage.

The man's wife, hearing the conversation said to her husband, ""Does she realize that our porch  goes ALL the way around the house?""

He responded, ""That's a bit cynical, isn't it?""

The wife replied, ""You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes we've been getting by email lately.""

Later that day, the blonde teenager came to the door to collect her money.
""You're finished  already?"" the startled husband asked.

""Yes, she replied, and I even had paint left over, so I gave it two coats."" 

Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00 and handed it to her along with a $10.00 tip.

“And, by the way,"" the teenager added, ""it's not a Porch, it's a Lexus.""","A blonde teenager, wanting to earn some extra money for the summer, decided to hire herself out as a ""handy-woman""",1818

(Man, I could really go for a good game of Scrabble right now if anybody's interested.)

Anyway, she didn't say anything about playing Scrabble on our cellphones. Instead, she pulled out a pen from her purse and started scribbling on a napkin. Pretty soon, I see she's challenged me to a game of Hangman!

Okay, it's no Scrabble, but whatever, I'm game.

After a few lucky guesses, I got all of the letters except one, but it was getting late and I had to cut it short to make the D train otherwise I'd be waiting all night for the next one. She said she would like to come with me on the D train so we could finish playing, but I told her that wouldn't be fair since she's way on the other side of town and her ride home would be a real pain in the ass. She said she didn't mind at all and that she could use a little pain in the ass to make things more interesting, but I think she was just being polite.

I felt bad because I realized this girl really likes word games just as much as I do, if not more. I was starting to feel a little sweet on her since we have similar interests and we get along really well. I'm really competitive, but in that moment I was willing to throw the game for her just to make her happy, so I told her her I'd make one last quick guess and then I really had to catch my train. With a wry little smirk, she said ""I bet you're pretty well hung."" Wrong move, lady! She was right: I only had one guess left before the hangman got me! Now she had poked the bear! I never back down from a challenge!

So, I told her I would take that bet and I immediately bet her one hundred dollars! She was shocked. Clearly, she underestimated me. Turns out, she didn't want to bet money, so I came up with a friendly wager instead. I told her the loser buys the winner a beer. She said in that case I should buy her a beer right now! More smack talk!

""We'll see who has the last laugh,"" I said. I folded up the napkin and I told her to keep it in her purse until next time. She threw it back at me and told me to shove it up my ass. This chick is possibly even more competitive than me! I think I've found my soulmate, fellas!

Anyway, I've been staring at this for a long time now... 

It's a real head-scratcher:

She tells the bank president that she has accumulated several hundred thousand dollars over the years and would like to open a trust in the bank.

The president is curious, so he asks her, ""Where did you get all this money?"" The old lady replies, ""I make bets.""

The president then asks, ""Bets? What kind of bets?""

The old woman says, ""Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.""

""Ha!"" laughs the president, ""That's ridiculous -- you can never win that kind of bet!""

The old lady challenges, ""So, would you like to take my bet?""

""Sure,"" says the president, ""I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!""

The little old lady says, ""OK. I'll bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10 a.m. as a witness, and we'll see.""

The next morning, the little old lady appears with her lawyer at the president's office. ""OK,"" she says, ""Time to drop your pants and settle this bet.""

The president complies. The little old lady peers closely at his balls and asks if she could feel them. ""Well, OK,"" says the bank president, ""since there's so much money on the line.""

Just then, the lawyer starts banging his head against the wall. The president asks the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

She replies, ""I bet him $50,000 that at 10 a.m. today, I'd have the president of the Bank of Canada's balls in my hand.""

God looked over the zebras for a moment then proclaimed, ""You are who you are.""

A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?""

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.""

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.""

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""",Three Chinese tortures.,85

The preacher sees a farmhouse just down the road and decides to go knock on the door, to ask the farmer's permission to hunt on his land. He leaves the deacon in the car while he goes in. He lays out his plea to the farmer, and he farmer mulls it over.

""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'll let you hunt on my land on one condition. I've got this horse -- I love her, but she's extremely sick and needs to be put down. I've had her for years, and I don't have the heart to do it, myself, so I'll tell you what: if you'll put my horse down, I'll let you hunt on my land.""

The preacher agrees, but on his way back out to the car he decides he's going to play a trick on the deacon. 

""That dagum farmer!"" the preacher exclaims, when he gets back to the car. ""The-son-of-a-gun was rude, and flat out refused to let us hunt! I'm gonna take out his horse!""

The preacher raised his gun. *BLAM!* He shot the horse.

Then, from behind him, he heard *BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!*

""Cool! A genie!"" the man thought, correctly.

He made his three wishes and I told him I'd grant them over the course of several hours. He began to wait for them to become reality. To work I went. The door bell rang. He opened the door and found a large pile of money. 

A couple hours later the door bell rang once again. He opened the door and found a group of beautiful women with deep desires for him.

A couple hours later the door bell rang for the final time. He opened the door. Three men in white hoods grabbed him, wrapped his neck with rope and suspended him from the oak tree out front, strangling him to death.

You see, I get why he wanted a lot of money and I get why he wanted a lot of women. But I still don't understand why he wanted to be hung like a nigger.

After a few hundred metres the horse was closing in on the finishing line. Given that the dog or snake were nowhere to be seen, the horse decided to take a breather and take a sip from the nearby river.

""SQUEAK!"" came a sudden noise. The horse let out a whine and fell into the water.

The conniving snake had sneakily latched onto the horse before the start of the race and had a live rodent hidden in his gut prepared for this very moment. ""Sssssorry.."" he muttered sarcastically as he began to slither towards the finish.

To the snake's horror the dog was already at the finishing line! Puffing and wheezing the snake asked ""How?!"" To which the dog replied ""Mate our owners are sick in the head.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother. Cinderella said, ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?""

The fairy godmother replied, ""Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish: ""The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks, and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.""

Instantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.

Cinderella said, ""Ooh, thank you, Fairy Godmother!""

The fairy godmother replied, ""It is the least that I can do. What do you want for your second wish?""

Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, ""I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.""

At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned - and Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years.

Then the fairy godmother spoke once more: ""You have one more wish; what shall it be?""

Cinderella looked over to the frightened dog in the corner and said, ""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old dog, into a kind and handsome young man.""

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.

The fairy godmother said, ""Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life."" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone as suddenly as she appeared.

For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.

Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young, muscular arms. He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered....

""Bet you're sorry now that you cut my nuts off!""",Cinderella was now 95 years old.,47

It was announced today that the GST would definitely apply to the penis because it provides a service. 

The way the tax will apply was difficult to decide. This was due to the fact 40 percent of the time it is hanging around unemployed, 30 percent of the time it is hard up, 20 percent of the time it is pissed off and 10 percent of the time it is in a hole. On top of that is has two dependents and they are both nuts. 

Effective from July, 2016, a penis will be taxed according to size, 10""-12” Luxury Tax, 8""-10” Pole Tax, 5""-8” Privilege Tax, 4""-5” Nuisance Tax. Males exceeding 12” must file under capital gains. Anyone under 4” is eligible for a refund 

(Please do not ask for an extension).

The Taxpayers Association is still awaiting clarification on a number of questions raised on this new tax, including: 

Are there penalties for early withdrawal? 

What if one’s penis is self employed?

Do multiple partners count as corporation? 

Are condoms deductible as occupational essentials (work time clothes)?",New Taxes proposed.,1

After a few weeks of research they found out that almost all of the birds were being killed by motorcyclists. Instead of helping, this information just confused the scientists more. So they decided to carry on their investigation. After a few more weeks the scientists discovered something truly amazing,  when the birds found a carcass on the side of the road two birds would go to eat it while another kept watch for predators or vehicles approaching. This, the scientists found, was why so many crows were dying. It's very easy for a crow to say ""Caww"" but it's difficult for them to pronounce ""Motorcycle"".

She also takes a liking to a particularly foul-mouthed and ill-tempered parrot (this shop has a lot of them). She takes the parrot home, thinking it will be a fun project to clean up his act.

At home, she tries to teach the parrot how to say ""You look nice this evening."" However, the parrot will only say, ""You look like shit!""

She tries to teach the parrot how to say ""Please feed me."" However, he will only say, ""Yo, gimme some fucking food, bitch!""

She tries for days to change the parrot's habits, but he is still as foul-mouthed and rude as ever. The woman's patience is growing thin, and she begins to feel that she made a terrible mistake buying such a mean pet.

Finally, one day, after an hour of trying to teach the parrot to say something nice, the parrot says, ""Shut the fuck up already, you old ugly hag!"" The woman is fed up, screams, and in her frustration, opens the freezer door and stuffs the parrot inside.

The parrot begins squawking loudly and furiously, beating his wings and making an enormous racket from inside the freezer. After about ten seconds, the noise stops. Fearing the worst, the woman immediately feels a wave of remorse and shame wash over her. She throws open the freezer door, and is relieved to see the parrot is alive and well.

He calmly steps out of the freezer, hops onto the counter, and says, ""Thank you so much for letting me out. I very much appreciate it.""

The woman is stunned, but says, ""You're welcome.""

The parrot continues, ""I'm sorry about my earlier behavior. If there's ever anything you need, I am at your service.""

St. Peter shows the nun the container and she places her hands in the water. Harps play, the gates open and the nun walks through the pearly gates. St. Peter calls the next nun up and asks her the same question. She replays ""I have but it doesn't count because I didn't like it...""  ""Don't worry."" Says St Peter ""All is forgiven. You just need to cleanse what ever part of your body touch the penis in this container of holy water."" The nun steps up and puts her arm up to her elbows in the holy water.

St. Pete calls the third nun, before he can even ask the question, the fourth nun walks up and says ""Sorry to interrupt, I don't want to break protocol. There is just no way I'm going to gargle with that holy water after gets through dipping her ass in there...""",Four nuns die in a bus accident...,2

He quickly dismisses this idea and sums it up to the stress causing him to think too deeply about the situation. 

At the rehearsal, she pulled him aside and said that later that evening she had some last minute wedding plans that she wanted to discuss and asked him to stop by her house after the rehearsal. 

The man is skeptical but obliges. When he shows up he and his soon to be mother-in-law are the only ones there. She sits him down on the couch and says ""Look, I understand you are going to be marrying my daughter tomorrow and this is the last chance I'm going to have at this. I want you to meet me back in the bedroom and fuck me silly before everything is official. I'm going to go back there and get completely naked and the next move is up to you.""

She leaves and the man is sitting on the couch in deep though about how to handle this situation. After a couple minutes he stands up and heads for the front door. When he opened it, there stood his soon to be father-in-law with tears of joy streaming down his face, ""You are the one!

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. 

I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it.

Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.

I asked him what was wrong; He said, ""nothing."" 

I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. 

He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. 

He smiled slightly, and kept driving.  I can't explain his behavior. 
I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent.

Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’

There's a mile-long line at the gates. Saint Peter steps away from the gate and walks down the line to address the situation to the believers.

""Hello,"" began Saint Peter. ""As you can see, heaven is a bit backed up right now. Some non-believers have been shut out of hell and purgatory, and they were sent here. As you can see, there is a long wait to get into heaven.""

""I might be able to fix it,"" replied the plumber. Saint Peter lets the plumber cut the line to heaven, and the plumber wanders around for a few minutes. He eventually finds a lever in a secret control room. The traffic in heaven breaks up, and the non-believers descend into hell.

Saint Peter is impressed by the plumber. ""So that's where I built the control room. I'm impressed. You are more than welcome to stay in heaven now. May God embrace you.""

""There's no need to thank me,"" said the plumber. ""Whenever a toilet is clogged, you call a plumber to flush the crap away."" Saint Peter is insulted by the plumber's terminology. The plumber can sense it. ""There's one piece of crap that didn't get flushed down. But thank God you said I'm welcome to stay. I hate the sewers anyway.""",A plumber dies and goes to heaven.,0

He lowered the window between him and his driver, and ordered the car to be stopped.  The driver pulled the car to the side of the road, and the lawyer got out to investigate. “Why are you eating grass?” he asked one man.
 
“We don’t have any money for food,” the poor man replied.
 
“Oh, come along with me then,” instructed the lawyer.
 
“But, sir, I have a wife and two children!”
 
“Bring them along!” replied the lawyer. He turned to the other man and said, “Come with us.”
 
“But sir, I have a wife and six children!” the second man answered.
 
“Even better. Bring them as well!” answered the lawyer as he headed for his limo.
 
They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limo. Once underway, one of the poor fellows says, “Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you.”
 
The lawyer replied, “No problem. The grass at my home is almost a foot tall.”",A wealthy lawyer,307
