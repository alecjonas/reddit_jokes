The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple is still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?",Getting Married In Heaven,376

""Please, at least let me at least try!"" He pleaded.

""Very well,"" replied the priest. ""Follow me.""
The priest led him into the church and up the steeple. There was a large bell overhanging the sanctuary.

""I need this rung at noon every Sunday, but I'm not sure how you can pull the rope"" said the priest.

Without a moment's hesitation the fellow barreled headfirst into the side of the bell and rang it. To the priests surprise, it rang a beautiful tone. The priest gave him the job and went on his way. For many Sundays the man did his job. No one ever noticed him and he was rather forgotten of, even by the priest. He collected a deduction of the offerings for his support of the church without interference, after service.

One Sunday, when the priest was about to preform the Mass, it struck noon. The armless man promptly ran towards the bell, missed it, fell into the sanctuary and died.

Everyone stood up in shock, the priest running to him shouting in regret.

The congregation noticed the priests intimate concern and asked ""You know him? What was he doing? What is his name?""

The priest, after thinking for a moment trying to remember, said ""I don't know, but he rings a bell.""",A priest lived behind his chapel,22

Then I saw a snake with a frog in its mouth. I knew that getting that frog would be a good idea but the snake was a cottonmouth.

Knowing the snake couldn’t bite me with the frog in his mouth I grabbed him right behind the head, took the frog, and put it in my bait bucket.

Now the dilemma was how to release the snake without getting bit. So, I grabbed my bottle of whiskey and poured a little in his mouth, as to try to maybe paralyze the bastard. It worked! He went limp. I released him into the lake without incident and carried on fishing using the frog.

A little later, I felt something banging against my boot. I looked down and saw the same bastard with two frogs in his mouth.

I was a little more successful today than usual.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Anyway, he grew a little too obsessed with it, and his wife was getting nervous about his mental health. One day the man comes home, and sees a note on the fridge from his wife. It says that she's leaving him, and she's taking the kids.

This caused the poor man to fly into a rage, throwing pots and pans everywhere and causing a general ruckus. His neighbors heard the noise and called the police.

So the police show up and surround his house with cop cars. They tell him to give himself up peacefully. The man says ""fuck that"" and grabs his shotgun, determined to make a last stand.

So he grabs his gun, loads it, and is ready to die in a blaze of glory. He looks at his calculator, and wth tears welling up in his eyes, says ""promise me you'll be with me until the end.""

And the calculator says?

""You can count on me.""",There once was a man with a sentient calculator,3

The American troops were told if they were ever in a rough situation, to look for frozen squirrels at the base of trees. Then place the frozen squirrel between their thighs (the warmest part of the body) to warm it up. The squirls would be so grateful for the rescue, they would scurry off and find some of its little squirrely stashed food, and share it with the rescuer. 

A news reporter interviewed surviving veterans, and one told his story. 
""We were flying back home, when the plane was shot down. There were others that survived the crash, but not for long. I heard the enemy approaching, so I ran. I didn't know where I was for 3 months. I didn't have any food, and I wasn't prepared. But what kept me alive was the briefing we received when we had first arrived. I looked under at least 100 trees, before I found my first squirrel​. He ran off after I unfroze him, and I didn't think I would see him again. After the first one I knew what sort of tree to look for, and unfroze about 6-7 more. By the end of the week I was eating like a king, with 16 tiny hands bringing me berries, and little sweet shrubs. Now don't get me wrong I never want to do that again, but those furry little angels kept me alive during a harsh German winter."" 

But not everyone was so happy about the squirrels. Another veteran stated ""The only thing those damn rodents gave me, was frozen nuts"".",Bombs and Berries (Long) (Original),5

""Excuse me Sisters, do you know if there happen to be any dwarven nuns?""

A bit taken aback, the nuns look at each other before replying ""No, not that we are aware of.  Lets go ask Mother Superior""

As they journey to the convent, the dwarves go back to the ""DID NOT""  ""Did too"" argument, all the way to the convent.

Upon reaching the Convent, the dwarves cease arguing, but the two keep shooting the third wry smiles and knowing grins.

Upon hearing their question, Mother Superior states that no, in all her years she has never heard of a dwarven nun.  Further research into church history and records show the same, not a single dwarven nun to be found.

The three thank the sisters for their time and walk out the door.  The Nuns look at each other bewildered, and before they can do more than start for the door to ask why, they hear two of the dwarves cry out in loud voices ""DOPEY SCREWED A PENGUIN, DOPEY SCREWED A PENGUIN""",3 Dwarves.....,64

Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why. That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed saying, “I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed.

“However, today the temptation was too much, and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box?”

Bill thought for a while and said, “I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”

Hillary was shocked, but said, “I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that three times is not that bad considering the years.”

They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, “Why do you have all that money in the box?”

Bill answered, “Whenever the box filled with empties, I cashed them in.” ",Bill and Hillary are now married for 40 years,270

A game of truth-telling is being played at court by a Queen and her retinue. A knight is asked by the Queen if he has fathered any children; he is forced to admit that he has not.
The Queen nods in assent, saying ""you do not have the look of a man who could please his mistress when you hold her naked in your arms. For your beard is little more than the kind of fuzz that ladies have in certain places, and it is easy to tell from the state of the hay whether the pitchfork is any good.""
On his turn, the knight asks ""Lady, answer me without deceit. Is there hair between your legs?"" When she replies, ""none at all"", he comments, ""Indeed I do believe you, for grass does not grow on a well-beaten path.""",Old joke that never gets old,307

""Why do little?"" She asked the pet shop owner. The owner looked at her seriously and said, ""Look, I should tell you first hand that this bird used to live in a brothel and can say some pretty vulgar stuff.""

The woman thought about this but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She took it home and hung the birds cage up and waited for it to say something.

The bird looked around the room for a moment, then at her and said,"" New house new madam."" The woman was a little shocked at first at the implication, but thought to herself, that wasn't too bad. It's kind of amusing actually.

When her two teenage daughters returned home from school, the bird saw them and said, ""New house, new madam, new girls."" Again, the woman and the daughters were taken aback for a moment and later laughed about the situation considering where the bird had lived.

A few moments later, the woman's husband comes home from work. The bird looks at him and says, ""Hi Jack!""

As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then Adam said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are muslim.'' Then Jack said ''No way, I won't say I'm muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.

So Adam and Jack went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

Adam thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammed'. And Jack said 'My name is Jack'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Jack.' And told these other men to take Jack and give him food and drink.

Then he turned to Adam and said, 'Salaam Muhammed. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadhan)","There were two white Christian men, Adam and Jack,",125

One day, the king decided to find a suitable bride for his boy. He ordered his subjects to prepare a magnificent
feast and to invite princesses from all over the world.

More than 150 princesses attended the feast. The number was a bit overwhelming so a contest was held. After the
contest ended, top three princesses were chosen. The three princesses were standing in front of the king's throne and in
front of each princess there was a chest full of gold. Then the king said: ""Princesses, I give to each one of you
a chest full of gold, do as you please with it. Please return to me after six months!""

After six months the princesses and the chests were again in front of the king. The king asked the first princess: 
""What did you do with your gold my child?"". The princess said: ""Noble king, the gold you gave me, I used to buy lands and animals
and to hire workers. After we sold the production, the gold tripled, so I am returning the chest that you gave me, along with
two more chests full of gold!"". Then the king asked the same question to the second princess. The princess said: ""Noble king,
I used this gold to travel all over the word. I attended magnificent feasts and learned about different cultures. I went to the
far east and bought for myself beautiful garments, aromas and jewelry. There is a little gold left in the chest and I am returning
it to you."" Then the king asked the same question to the third princess. The third princess answered: ""Noble king, I could not allow 
myself to handle gold which does not belong to me! I am returning you the gold chest untouched."" Then the king asked his son: ""Well son, which
princess do you choose to be your bride?"". The prince said: ""Dad may I ask you something in private"", ""Sure son"" - answered the king.

It was a doctor notifying him that his wife had just been in a terrible accident and was in critical condition and in the ICU.

The man told the doctor to inform his wife where he was and that the he'd be there as soon as possible. As he hung up he realized he was leaving what was shaping up to be his best ever round of golf. He decided to get in a couple of more holes before heading to the hospital. He ended up playing all eighteen, finishing his round shooting a personal best 61, shattering the club record by five strokes and beating his previous best game by more than 10. He was jubilant.... Then he remembered his wife.

Feeling guilty he dashed to the hospital. He saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about his wife's condition.

The doctor glared at him and shouted, ""You went ahead and finished your round of golf didn't you!""

""I hope you're proud of yourself! While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself at the country club your wife has been languishing in the ICU! It's just as well you went ahead and finished that round because it will be more than likely your last! For the rest of her life she will require round the clock care, and you will be her care giver!""

The man was feeling so guilty he broke down and sobbed.

The doctor snickered and said, ""I'm just messing with you. She's dead. What'd you shoot?""",Beat round of Golf,29

A ""friend of a friend"" put him in touch with a nefarious underworld figure who went by the name of ""Artie."" Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out a spouse was $5,000. The husband said he was willing to pay that amount but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's life insurance money.

Artie insisted on being paid something up front. The man opened up his wallet, displaying the single dollar bill that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.

A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Safeway grocery store. There, he surprised her in the produce department and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands.

As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the scene. Unwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

Unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by hidden camera and observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police. Artie was caught and arrested before he could leave the store. Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the sordid plan, including his financial arrangements with the hapless husband.

And that is why, the next day in the newspaper, the headline declared:

ARTIE CHOKES TWO FOR A DOLLAR AT SAFEWAY",Tired of constantly being broke and stuck in an unhappy marriage...,376

""Hello, are you the young men from the car crash just now?"" He says. 

""Yes, and we assume this is heaven?"" Answered the first man

""Of course. Now, if you would follow me, we have some business to attend to"" 

God led them through the gate, and then stopped, just on the inside of the gates. The three men crowded into the gated portion of heaven, and the gate closed. 

""What's with the ducks?"" Says the second man, reaching forward to pet one.

""Ah, the ducks. Yes, one mustn't touch the ducks"" said God. 

The 2nd man pulled his hand back, and asked ""why can't we touch them?""

God ignored this question, and beckoned the first man over, to stand at his side. The man walks over, and stands by God.

God then says, ""do you see the gate all the way across the sea of ducks? Yes. Okay, now go touch it, but do NOT touch a duck""

The man hesitates, and then takes a few steps, over a duck here, over a duck there. Finally, he looses his balance and falls on the ground, touching a few ducks. 

""Oh that's too bad"" mutters God. 

God snaps his fingers, and down comes an angel, with a woman. The first man could not believe his eyes! This was the UGLIEST girl in the worl... heaven.

As quick as a flash, the angel handcuffs the man to the girl, and carries them off. 

""Next!"" 

The second man stands next to God, and prepares himself for the task at hand. 

God says the word, and the man starts sprinting, leaping over the ducks and making excellent ground. Unfortunately, an duck flies up, and hits him in the hand. 

The same fate for the second man. 

Lastly, the third man. Who had been quit and timid the entire time. 

He starts his way across the duck filled area. Inch by inch. Taking his time, until finally, he touches the gate at the other side. 

""Congratulations, you made it!"" Says God. 

But before he knew it, an angel appeared, and brought down the most BEAUTIFUL girl this man has ever seen! They say hello, and the girl says, ""you made it across?"" The man says yes, with pride, and asks, ""and you?""

All of a sudden, a bear appeared and ate the Czechoslovakian man. The Jewish guy ran back to find someone to help. He found a Forest Ranger and told him what had happened. So the ranger took a gun and went back into the forest. There were two bears together. ""Now there are only two bears on this mountain,"" the ranger explained. ""One is a male, the other is a female. Which is the one that ate your friend?"" The Jewish guy said it was definitely the male bear. So the ranger fired the gun and killed the bear, while the other ran away. When they cut it open to see, its stomach was empty.

The moral of the story? Never trust a Jew that says the Czech is in the male.

Having unsuccessfully tried to dissolve nauseum in 7642 different solvents over a 10-year period, Schlimazel finally came to the 30 mL of Old Aardvark Bottled-in-Bond that was the only remaining liquid in his laboratory. Always willing to suffer personal loss in the name of science, Schlimazel calculated the amount of nauseum needed to make up a 0.03 molar solution, put the Aardvark bottle on the desk of his faithful technician Edgar P. Settera, weighed out the calculated amount of nauseum and put it next to the bottle, and then wrote the message that has become part of history:

""Why are you guys just yelling numbers?"" He asks his cellmate. ""What's so funny about random numbers?""

 

""Well,"" says the older prisoner, ""They're not random. It's just that we've all been in this here prison for so long, we all know all the same jokes. So after a while we just started giving them numbers and yelling those numbers is enough to remind us of the joke instead of telling it.""


Wanting to fit in, the new prisoner walks up to the bars and yells, ""**89**!"" Suddenly everyone breaks out into nonstop laughter, which after 5 minutes gets louder and louder. After 10 minutes the guards have had enough and decide to go in. They turn on the lights, pull the prisoners (all whom are still laughing) out of their cells and put them all facedown on the floor and try to restore order.
The new guy looks across to his cellmate who's lying facedown in front of him and ask ""Why wouldn't anyone stop laughing?""
