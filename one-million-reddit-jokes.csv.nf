His favourite sport was ping-pong and he was really into it. One day he decided to find canditates so his daughter can marry someone. He hosted a huge ping-pong tournament and only 3 canditates left in the end. He called them into his throne room and said to them: "" Since you are 3 people left the last challenge will be different. Whoever brings me the most beautiful ping-pong balls will get my daughter and a part of the castle. Now go you have 2 days"" 

After 2 days the canditates return to the throne room. The first one shows to the king some silver ping-pong balls and the king said to him: ""I'm afraid these balls are not enough but they are also really beautiful so I will give you only a part of my castle."" 

The second one had some shiny golden ping-pong balls and the king was so happy that he was sure that this was the best canditate but he thought he would check the third canditate as well.

The third canditate was a bit sad looking so he asked him: ""Why do you look so sad? You didn't manage to find anything?"" The canditate puts his hand into his pocket and grabs some grey-hairy balls. Everyone was stunned. The king asked him: ""What exactly is this?"" And the canditate responded: ""Sorry master, I misheard.

 pulls into a little inlet where an old man is sitting on a wooden dock also fishing.

The man is entranced by her beauty when he notices the old man walking up the path to the woman. 

They exchange some words and the old man holds out a pale. A few seconds later the old man comes down and starts fishing again. 

Confused , the man in the boat pulls over to the old man and asks 

""Excuse me sir but is that your wife up there?"" 

The old man , delighted by the Inquisition replies 
"" Well yes sir she is! She's a beaut ain't she?"" 

""Yes sir she is.. but I have to ask..Why the hell arnt you up there fucking her? With her body and no offense your age , I'd be up there fucking her all night.""

""Well you see Sonny theres the rub. She's got some nasty vaginal discharge. Smells horrid. Only happens during sex.""

Stunned the man asks ""ok.. well why aren't you doing anal?"" 

""Well she also has a bit of that ibs ""

""Shit why isn't she sucking you off?""

"" Bad case of mouth rot""

""Well damn mister what is with the pale ""


""Oh that? She's got worms.""

Reluctantly, the officer let the kid go.

The next day, the same kid rolled up on his bike to the Mexican border with another sack in his hand.

Again, the officer asked what was in the bag. He searched through the bag and once again had the sack tested of its contents, but it was just sand.

The officer had no choice but to let the kid leave again.

This went on for years. The officer was sure that one day the kid would have something else in the sack, and eventually he drove himself to insanity. He was fired and became a heavy drinker.

One day, he was at the bar when the teenager who had been crossing the border everyday with the sack of sand sat down next to him.

The ex-border patrol officer looked at him and pleaded, ""Look. All those times you were crossing the border, I know you were smuggling something! Please just tell me what it was and give me some peace at mind. I don't even work as a cop anymore!""

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

The man is discouraged, but he saved the best for last. He tells the woman:

""Okay fine, I'll leave you alone, but you should know this last bit. I'm an only-child and my ill father is my only family. You see, he is going on 98 years of age and is barely clinging to life in a nursing home.

""Well sir,"" she now says flirtatiously, ""I think I'll have that drink. Do tell me more!""

One day, one of her friends said to her ""Anna, could you make me something interesting to play with?  My family doesn't have much money so I haven't gotten a new toy in quite a long time.""   

""of course!"" said Annabelle, ""I'll make something very special for you!""

So Anna went home and tried to think of something fun to make for her friend.  'Should I make something that flies?' thought Anna 'No that would be too hard'.   'Maybe I'll try floating.  Boats can be fun!  But no, we don't have any lakes or ponds around here.'   

Anna thought and she thought but nothing fun came to mind until finally, Eureka!

The next day Anna went up to her friend and proudly presented them with her invention.  It was a flat disk one could hold between their fingers and it would spin and spin and spin!

""I call it a 'Twiddle Turner'"" Anna exclaimed proudly.

""This is genious!' her friend cried, ""How'd you ever come up with it?""

post,6oqj7m,2qh72,jokes,false,1500668159,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6oqj7m/an_american_businessman_in_vietnam_long/,self.jokes,,"An American man is sent to Vietnam on a business trip. After his plane lands, he steps into the airport and realizes he's very hungry. He ducks into the closest restaurant and stares blankly up at the menu, not understanding anything written on it. He points at the first thing he sees that looks good, then smiles sheepishly at the bartender and opens his wallet, allowing her to rifle through the Vietnamese dongs and collect the amount owed. Taking his change, he sat down at the nearest table to wait on his food. Soon, the waitress comes out with an enormous plate of something that resembles chicken, and an equally large bowl of soup. She sets both down in front of him, smiles, and starts back to the kitchen. At this point, a young Vietnamese man comes through the door waving a gun. He shouts something intelligible at the bartender, who opens the cash drawer calmly and proceeds to pull dongs out to hand to the robber. The man with the gun turns, and as he does he stumbles, accidentally pulling the trigger and firing his gun in the general direction of the man and waitress, who up until that moment was frozen in fear. The gun going off apparently startled her back to reality, because she screamed and launched herself towards the American, upending his meal in his lap and burning him very badly. The robber and bartender both began to laugh as the American man jumped up and began brushing the chicken and soup off his crotch and legs. Even the waitress cracked a somewhat restrained smile, which further confused the American. After the robbery was completed, the bartender signaled for the man to stay as she picked up the phone and spoke more intelligible staccato words. A few moments later, the police arrived. As the bartender presumably gave her report of the robbery to the police, she pointed over at the man and mimed frenetic action and concluded by repeatedly slapping at her legs. The police officers laughed, completed their report and left. 

Having been dismissed by the officers, the American man stumbles through downtown searching for anything resembling a doctor or hospital to treat his burns. Finally, he saw a Caduceus painted on a door, and he went in to ask for help. When he entered, he encountered the same problem he'd had at the restaurant, in that no one understood him, and he didn't understand anyone else. Eventually, he dropped his pants, exposing the burns on his lap and legs, and held his arms spread in what he thought was the universal symbol for ""Help."" He was surprised again, however, when the nursing staff began to laugh at him. Angrily, he shoved through more doors until he found what appeared to be a doctor. Gesturing wildly towards his legs, he watched in shock as the doctor collapsed into a fit of giggles on the floor. 

Incensed, the man painfully pulled his pants back up, and limped as quickly as he could out of the hospital. Standing on the street corner, he phoned his boss, and explained the situation. Understandably, and not wanting a lawsuit on his hands, his boss told him to jump on the next flight back to the states and asked him to go to the first hospital he saw. ""Gladly,"" the man said, and hung up. 

At the airport once again, the man tried vehemently to explain his situation to the administration and flight staff, only to once again be treated to fits of laughter and lots of pointing at his burns. Cramming himself into a small seat, he asked for extra ice in his drink, which provided him with a teasing sense of relief on the long flight back home. 

The plane landed, and the man barged through the gate, then the terminal, and finally out of the airport and into the first hospital he came to. He spoke his native English to the receptionist, and stated that he was very badly burned. The nursing staff rushed him to a room, all serious faces and not a single giggle. ""This is more like it,"" said the man, as he donned his hospital gown. ""Now I'll get taken care of."" 

The doctor, a balding, grim-looking man, walked briskly into the examining room, lifted the gown and observed the wounds in a stoic silence that unnerved the burned man more so than the laughter he'd experienced from everyone else. In a gravelly voice, the doctor asked, ""Son, how did you get these burns?"" The man explained, recounting every detail, including the ridicule he experienced. The doctor simply nodded. 

Desperately seeking the understanding the old doctor had, the man practically yelled at him: ""Doc! Why were they laughing at me!? Has this all been some sort of sick joke?!""

""No,"" the doctor patiently replied. ""But everyone over there probably thought it was pho knee."" ",An American businessman in Vietnam (Long),3

post,6opdc0,2qh72,jokes,false,1500657612,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6opdc0/a_fisherman_walks_into_rjokes/,self.jokes,,"A fisherman walks into /r/jokes where he meets a bartender.  The bartender offers him a drink.  The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free.  The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts.  After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.  
  
The fisherman begins his tale.  ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""  
  
""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender.  I can see where this is going.  Golden rod.  This is a sex joke.  I've heard it before.""  
  
""No.  It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""  
  
""Wait a minute"" says the bartender.  ""I think you're in the wrong place.  This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis.  You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".  
  
""No.  It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish.  Neptune, god of the sea appeared.  He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend.  In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel.  The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.  
  
""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender.  ""Hey, Sad.  I'm neptune!  You want /r/dadjokes.  Don't waste my time"".  
  
""No.  It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again.  Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""  
  
The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""  
  
The bartender, confused, looks up.  ""What?  That's it?""  
  
The fisherman nods.  
  
The bartender, now, is very confused.  It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.  
  
He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""  
  
The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".  
  
The bartender asks ""Why not?""  
  
The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""  ",A fisherman walks into /r/jokes...,8748

The general answered both questions in the affirmative.

Another officer asked, ""Who will be the enemy?""

The general replied, ""All indications point to China.""

Everyone in the audience was shocked. A third officer remarked, ""General, we are a nation of only 150 million, compared to the 1.5 billion Chinese. Can we win at all, or even survive?"" 

The general answered, ""Just think about this for a moment: In modern warfare, it is not the quantity of soldiers that matters but the quality of an army's capabilities. For example, in the Middle East we have had a few wars recently where 5 million Jews fought against 150 million Arabs, and Israel was always victorious.""

He mentioned the trip to the barber who responded, ""Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded &amp; dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?"" ""We're taking Delta,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!"" ""Delta?"" exclaimed the barber. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?"" ""We'll be at the downtown International Marriott."" ""That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?"" ""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."" ""That's rich,"" laughed the barber. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."" A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome. ""It was wonderful,"" explained the man, ""not only were we on time in one of Delta's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel-it was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!"" ""Well,"" muttered the barber, ""I know you didn't get to see the pope."" ""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me."" ""Really?"" asked the Barber. ""What'd he say?"" He said, ""Where'd you get the terrible haircut?

When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.
When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the spoon?""
""Well,"" he explained, ""the restaurant's owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""
As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed.
Then I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the male waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""
""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of 'you know what', we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, Shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39 percent.""
""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""
""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know what my colleagues do, but I use the spoon.""",Restaurant,121

 1. The later you are, the more excited your dog is to see you.

 2. Dogs don't notice if you call them by another dog's name.

 3. Dogs like it if you leave lots of things on the floor.

 4. Dogs' parents never visit.

 5. Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point across.

 6. You never have to wait for a dog; they're ready to go, instantly, 24 hours a day.

 7. Dogs find you amusing when you're pissed.

 8. Dogs like to go hunting and fishing.

 9. Dogs won't wake you up at night to ask: ""If I died, would you get another dog?""

 10. If a dog has babies, you can put an ad in the paper and sell 'em.

 11. When you drop a silent one, dogs don't run around frantically with room spray.

 12. Dogs will let you put a studded collar on, without calling you a pervert.

 13. If a dog smells another dog on you, it won't kick you in the crotch; it just finds it interesting.

 And last, but not least:

 14. If a dog runs off and leaves you, it won't take half your stuff....

He had bagged all of the world's most famous big game, except a lion. He had made a few trips to Africa, but each time, he had never been fortunate enough to see one. So he started planning one final safari, and he decided he was going to get the best possible guide. As it turned out, the most knowledgeable lion guide was booked solid for the next few years - except for a week at the end of the summer. ""Someone must have just cancelled,"" he thought. ""What luck!"" So he booked the whole week. 
The day of the trip finally rolled around and the hunter arrived in Africa. Despite the fact that the summer was almost over, it was still incredibly hot. ""Maybe this is why no one booked the guide this week,"" he thought. But he'd come this far, and he was determined to bag a lion. So he met up with the hunting guide and they headed out to the savannah. The two men searched for days and days without seeing a single lion. The hunter began to get frustrated, but he decided to be patient for a little while longer. He was hunting with the best guide in Africa! Surely they would find a lion soon! But the entire week passed by without any sign of a lion. The hunter, incredibly disappointed, noticed that his guide didn't seem nearly as surprised at their lack of success.
""What happened?"" he asked the guide. ""Why aren't there any lions here?""
""I thought you knew,"" the guide replied. ""The pride goes before the fall.""",The Lion Hunter,3

For many months this bothered him, sometimes even keeping him up all night wondering.

On morning, he decided to see the wise old monkey in the baobab tree to find answers to his quandary. Far and long he traveled, until he was standing at the base of the tree, the canopy looming high above him.

""Wise monkey,"" he called, hoping to be heard, ""I come seeking your wisdom!""

Descending on a vine, the wise old monkey answered, ""What is it that troubles you, my child?""

""I've been thinking for months, monkey, and I can't decide if I am white with black stripes, or black with white stripes.""

""That is easy, for you are what you are. Now go, and be at peace.""

The zebra left to return to his herd, possibly more confused than when he had arrived. He turned the answer over in his mind for days and nights on end, deciding after a week he would return to the monkey and seek a better answer. So off he went.

At the base of the baobab tree once again, he called up to the wise monkey.

""Wise monkey, I have returned. I pondered your words and I'm more confused than ever. Am I white with black stripes, or am I black with white stripes?""

Not bothering to come down this time, the monkey called back, ""My child, if you were black with white stripes, I would have said, 'You is what you is.'""",A zebra was having a crisis.,23

a priest. I'm a rabbi. Just look at our cars. There's nothing
left, but we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God. God
must have meant that we should meet and be friends and
live together in peace the rest of our days.""

The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. This must
be a sign from God.""

The rabbi continues, ""And look at this. Here's another
miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of
Mogen David wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to
drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."" Then he
hands the bottle to the priest.

The priest agrees, takes a few big swigs, and hands the
bottle back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle,
immediately puts the cap on, and hands it back to the
priest.

Caller:  ""Hey, buddy, I need your advice on a very serious problem. 

For some time, now, I've suspected that my wife's been cheating on me.  

I've been seeing the usual signs ~ like the phone rings, and when I answer, the caller hangs up. Plus, she sure goes out with ""the girls"" a lot.  Well, last night about midnight, I woke up and she was **still** not home. So, I went and hid in the garage behind my bass boat to wait for her. 

When she finally came dragging home, she jumped out of some stranger's Ford F-250 Super Duty, buttoned up her blouse, pulled her panties out of her purse and wiggled into them.  

It was at that moment, while crouching behind the boat, that I noticed a hairline crack in my outboard motor mounting bracket. 

Now, Don, here's my question:  Is this something that I can weld back together, or do I need to replace the **whole** bracket?""

The doctor asked him how he knew that.
""Why,"" the old man, ""I must live a good, clean life or the Lord wouldn't turn the bathroom light on for me every time I get up in the middle of the night.""
The doc looked a little concerned. ""You mean when you get up in the night to go to the bathroom, the Lord Himself turns on the light for you.""
""Yep,"" the old man said, ""Whenever I get up to go to the bathroom, the Lord turns the light on for me.""
Well, the doctor didn't say anything else, but when the old man's wife came in for her check up, he felt he had to let her know what her husband said. ""I just want you to know,"" the doctor said. ""Your husband's in fine physical shape but I'm worried about his mental conditions. He told me every night when he gets up to go to the bathroom, the Lord turns the light on for him.""
""Why that rascal,"" she said. ""I thought someone has been peeing in the refrigerator.""",Annual Check-up,11

When it was time to break for lunch he realized he had left his lunch on the bus.  After walking through the parking lot, he boarded the bus only to find a naked woman in his seat having sex with a man while several other men were waiting for their turn.  Already annoyed that he had to walk back to the bus, the man lost control and just started beating up all of the men on the bus.  When he had finished, he informed the woman that she was in his seat and he just wanted his lunch box.

Before she could say anything a security guard who had witnessed the whole thing zapped the dyslexic with a taser and dragged him off the bus and secured him.

The security guard asked a few questions and quickly surmised that the dyslexic had mistakenly boarded the ""Anonymous Sex Daily"" bus rather than the ""Dyslexia Anonymous"" bus.

A reporter who witnessed the commotion came over to find out what had happened, and the headline in the paper the next day read...

Dyslexic punches up fuckline; Whoops, wrong bus.",The dyslexic.,2

His family was going hungry. He was behind on all of his bills. He became unemployed, and started to grow ill. He wrote ""Dear heavenly father. I've no other resources. No other place to turn. I don't ask for much. I really just need $1500 to catch up on my mortgage. Amen.""  
  
So the mailman came by and picked up his letter addressed to God. Got a kick out of it and decided to open it up with his coworkers. They felt bad for the poor man and decided to scrounge up some money to help the old guy out. They mustered up about $1000 bucks and dropped it in his mailbox in an envelope.  
  
The next day the find another envelope addressed to God. They open it up and read ""Thank you God so much! I knew we could count on you. Just an observation: Next time don't send it through the post office. Those darn bastards took $500.""

Due to fatherly pressure he tries out for the team but never truly enjoys it.

Eventually he gives up and tells his father his secret, he wants to do figure skating instead.

The boy's father disowns him and kicks him out.

The boy is sad that he can no longer play without help from his parents and falls into a depression.

Eventually he finds a pair of beat up old skates and takes them to the rink.

A coach seeing him practice encourages him and before long he's good enough to skate in the olympics.

Holding his medal high the boy looks to the crowd and see's his father in the stands, tears in his eyes clapping for the boy.

Years later the boy, now a grown man takes out his battered old skates looking to relive his glory days on the town lake.

Suddenly tragedy strikes as a runaway snowmobile hits the man.

The man, now an activist for amputees proudly shows his single remaining skate as he gathers support for other injured people.

The man is more famous now than he ever was as a figure skater and he even decides to sell  his remaining skate to get more donations.

At the auction a woman jokingly asks him if they will get it for cheaper since they are missing one.

Offended by the insensitive joke the man tells her of course not!

Sheesh, the woman replies… what a **cheapskate**.",A pair of skate.,2

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""; Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story. Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

 

 

Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted was a Marine jet pilot in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He bailed-out out before it crashed. All he had was a Colt .45, a shovel, and a bottle of Jack Daniels.


 

On the way down, he drank bottle of Jack. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 8 with his Colt .45, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his shovel and killed 20 more while screaming like a banshee! Then the blade on his shovel broke, so he killed the rest with his bare hands.""

“Bartender, get me something new and fresh from r/jokes.” He chirped


“Sorry mate, all we have are reposts from the last 8 years”


“How can this be!” The Redditor exclaimed “If I can’t get my fix from r/jokes, then what is the point of living!”


“Yeah, what IS the point of living” the bartender grumbled
The Redditor then sat there for what felt like hours, pondering the meaning of his pitiful existence. Over the later days, he began to become erratic, asking Scientists, Men of God and even random strangers what they thought the purpose of living is.
Unsatisfied with all his answers, he climbs to the side of a bridge in hopes of throwing himself off. His feet where on the edge and he was about to jump when and old man taps his side and says to him


“Do not jump. I know the answers you seek. Look to the stars and continue onwards”


The old man the shuffled off without another word.
With renewed hope swelling in his chest, he gathers all his life savings and builds a rocket ship. Tirelessly, he worked day and night for many, many years until it was finished.


Immediately he jumped in and launched off towards the stars, aimlessly wandering space for so long that he forgot, until he landed on another planet inhabited by alien creatures.


Clambering out of the ship, he desperately asked each alien who came across his path


“Do you know? Do you know the purpose of living?”


The alien creatures could not understand what he was saying, but understood that glint of questions in his eyes like so many others that have come past. They pointed him to a nearby comet that was orbiting the planet. He climbed back into the rocket and shot off to the comet.


Upon landing, he realises that the ball of ice is completely barren, so he then decides to dig.


So he digs and he digs and he digs, but the Redditor was now an old man and those years of searching where finally taking his toll on him.


But as he gets to the center, he finds a piece of parchment with something written on it. The Redditor could feel that these were his last breaths but he was so close to the answer that plagued him his entire life.


The parchment simply read


“OP’s Mom”


The Redditor gave a faint chuckle

""Oh, okay."" And she walks to her seat. 

The drunk man laughs hysterically at the exchange, and the bus driver gives him a wink. 

At the next stop, another beautiful woman steps onto the bus. Again, as she pays her fare and turns to walk past, the bus driver says ""Can I tickle your ass with a feather?""

To which she replies ""WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?!""

""Oh, I said 'Particularly nice weather.' Isn't it?""

""Oh. Okay"" and she finds her seat.

The drunk man is rolling with laughter this time, but once he regains his composure a little, he slurs ""Let me do one!"" To the bus driver. 

The driver says ""Oh no buddy, I've driven this bus for 10 years, there's no way you can get it on the first try.""

The drunk says ""come on! It'll be hilarious.""

She wasn't unusual, nor was the travel bag she carried, except for one thing. She would approach people who were sitting on the beach, glance around, then speak to them.

Generally, the people would respond negatively and she would wander off, but occasionally someone would nod and there would be a quick exchange of money for something she carried in her bag. The couple assumed she was selling drugs and debated calling the cops, but since they didn't know for sure they just continued to watch her.

After a couple of weeks the wife asked, ""Honey, have you ever noticed that she only goes up to people with boom boxes and other electronic devices?""
He hadn't and said so. Then she said, ""Tomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what she's really doing.""

Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. ""Well, is she selling drugs?"" she asked excitedly.""

""No, she's not."" he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.

""Well, what is it, then?"" his wife fairly shrieked.

The man grinned and said. ""Her name is Sally and she's selling batteries.""

""Batteries?"" cried the wife.

""Yes,"" he replied. ""Sally sells C cells by the Seashore.""",Boomboxes on the beach,260

He was bored of his work life, and it was Christmas time, so he decided to go on vacation, and he settled on Mexico. He went to Mexico, and after arriving to his hotel, he decided to ask the man behind the desk about tourist locations. The man told him about the location where people claimed to have seen the Chupacabra. He didn’t believe it, but after much convincing, he decided to go. He went there, and with his camera waited all day and night to try and find it. After much failure, he concluded that the Chupacabra was a myth. He forgot about it and decided to enjoy his vacation. Eventually he returned home, and went back to work. Finally, the summer came, and he decided he wanted to go on vacation again. Since it was summer, he decided on going to the himalayas. When he arrived, he asked someone about tourist locations, and the person suggested the location where the abominable snowman was last sighted. He felt ripped off by the Chupacabra one, but he decided to give it a try. So, putting on his gear, he hiked until he reached his location. He waited all day and night with his camera but didn’t find it. Thus, he concluded that the abominable snowman was also a myth. He enjoyed the rest of the vacation and eventually went back home, slightly disappointed. The rest of the year went by, and eventually it was summer again. He decided he was going to travel to Scotland. When he arrived to his hotel, he asked about tourist locations. The guy behind the desk told him to visit Loch Ness, because that is where the Loch Ness monster lived. The man was enraged. He was not about to get scammed again. He got angry at the man behind the desk, and so he stormed out of the hotel. He decided to ask random people about tourist locations, but every one of them suggested Loch Ness, so that he might find the Loch Ness monster. Feeling frustrated, he decided to give this one last try. He went to the Loch to prove once and for all that there was no such thing as the Loch Ness monster. He started swimming into the water, and swimming, and swimming, until he was far from shore. “See everyone, it’s a scam. It doesn’t exist!” He was feeling pleased with himself until he felt something grab his leg. He started feeling nervous. All of a sudden, he was pulled underwater. He panicked, but decided to turn and face whatever grabbed him. Lo an behold, it was the Loch Ness monster. “Oh no!” He thought. “This time I was myth-taken!”",I apologize for this ahead of time,40

However, at the local auction the going price for horses was too steep and the preacher ended up buying a donkey. The preacher figured he had the donkey, he might as well enter it in the race. 

The next day the donkey came in third. The racing form's headline the following day read, ""Preacher's Ass Shows.""

The preacher was so pleased with his donkey that he entered him the next day also. The donkey won. The newspaper's headline read, ""Preachers Ass Out in Front."" 

The bishop was so upset with this type of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in the races anymore. Then, the headlines read, ""Bishop Scratches Preacher's Ass."" This was too much for the bishop, and he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. 

The preacher decided to give the animal to a nearby convent. Next day's headlines read, ""Nuns Have Best Ass in Town."" 

The bishop fainted! He informed the nuns to get rid of the animal. So they sold it to a farmer for $10.00. Next day the paper read, ""Nun Peddles Ass for Ten Bucks.""

It's seen as very much a reward by officers and higher-ups. It's crew are mostly female, with some males on board, in case military action is required.

One returning ship dropped anchor alongside the SS Suckmarine, and let their men board the service sub. Upon entry, it was discovered that this crew were almost entirely male. The crew that were dropped off thought nothing of it, and carried on finding a suitable and willing partner to satisfy their needs. The crew men were mostly willing, too. Once they had all had their fill, as was tradition, all crew men gathered at the helm to thank the SS Suckmarine for their services to their country and fellow crew. As the speech began, it became clear the crew of the service submarine became a little uneasy.
