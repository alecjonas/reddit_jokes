Since the movie studio doesn't want to endanger their movie star they tell the hospital staff to spare no expenses and after multiple tests and scans a doctor walks into the room where Bruce is laying. He tells Bruce he has good news and bad news.   
\- Well let me hear the bad news first. 

   \- So Mr. Willis. We have detected that there is a problem with your heart. This is most likely due to a combination of your age and your fierce acting career. So no more starring in action movies Mr. Willis. 

   \- The good news then?  
   \- Well, as long as you take these four pills at seven o'clock each morning. You will be able to live a normal life as long as you stay away from acting.  


It wasn't a hard choice for Bruce - he had money in the bank and a long acting career behind him. Even though he was sad to be replaced by CGI for the remaining shots in what now would be his last movie.   
The days went by and Bruce did enjoy his retirement travelling the word and spending time with his family. The alarm Especially his wife who was happy to once again spend time with him (even though he needed those blue pills in bed). Bruce also used his fame to do a lot of charity work. Always with the alarm set to 07-00 so he could take his pills.   


The years went by but then suddenly Bruce got a phone call from the Academy Award. The wanted to award him with the Academy Honorary Reward (also known as the Lifetime Achievement Award) for a long dedicated career in the movies. He accepted it gladly. And the night before the big gala he and the wife decided to have a long romantic evening together in bed.   


The big day came and the alarm sounded at 07.00 sharp as it has did every morning for the last years. Bruce took his four pills and decided to snooze another hour. When he woke at 08.00 he felt a pain he never felt before, it was as something was torn from his chest. He looked over to his nightstand and realized his fatal mistake - he had taken four pills of Viagra instead of his heart medicine and now had a raging boner instead of a functioning heart. He called his doctor who answered that there is nothing more to do, that his time has come and he should get his affairs in order.   


So Bruce gathered his family - who of course was saddened over his demise. It was 09.30 and they all sat around his bed when Bruce's wife asked him if he was sad.   


No. Bruce replied. My family is gathered here and tonight I was going to be awarded for a lifetime of work in the movie industry. No. I am not sad. Today is a good day to die hard.

the finest gloves available, and asked the saleswoman to have
them delivered along with a note he had written.  Unfortunately,
the clerk mixed up the order while wrapping the merchandise. 
Instead of the expensive gloves, the clerk accidentally wrapped a
pair of panties and sent them to the young man's sweetheart along
with the following note which he had written.
      

Darling:
       I have been trying desperately to come up with a special 
gift for your birthday.  I chose these because I noticed that you 
are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening.  
I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but since your 
sister wears the short ones which are so easy to remove, I wanted
to get the same style for you.
      
You may be concerned that these are a delicate shade, however,
the saleslady showed me a pair that she had been wearing for
three weeks and they were hardly soiled.  She said that there are
a couple of important care considerations that I should mention
to you.  First, when you take them off, remember to blow in them
before putting them away since they will naturally be a little
damp from wearing.  Second, be sure to keep them on while
cleaning them so that they won't shrink.
      
The saleslady made such an impression upon me that I had her try
them on for me.  She really looked great in them and I can just
imagine how great they are going to look on you.  I decided to
mail these so that you would have them in time for your birthday. 
I really hesitated because I wanted so much to be there to watch
you put them on for the first time.  There is little doubt in my
mind that many other hands will have touched them before I see
you again.  I can hardly wait to run my own hands over them or do
as the French do, and gently kiss them.  I hope you really like
them and will wear them for me on Friday night.
      
      
p.s.  The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little
fur showing.",A young man wanted to buy a pair of expensive gloves for his sweetheart’s birthday...,8

In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totalling $95,000.

He asked her about the contents.
'When we were to be married,' she said, ' my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.'

The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two Times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with Happiness.

'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the doll, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?'

'Oh,' she said, 'that's the money I made from selling the dolls.'",A man and woman had been married for years...,15

Like Batman and Robin.

Only we didn’t solve crimes and the tight, latex outfits we owned were used in the bedroom and not on the streets.

I truly thought she was the one.

But she had one character flaw that proved too great to overcome.

She went “*ahhhhh”* after every sip of a drink.

Drove me close to madness I tell you.

I know what you’re thinking.

You’re thinking, “Alex, would you really throw away a perfectly good relationship over something so small?”

And you’re probably right.

But I could not get past it.

I’d cringe every time I heard the kettle boiling, knowing full well what was to come.

She’d sit down. Blow cool air through her big, beautiful lips.

Then raise the fine, white china cup to her face and take the smallest, gentlest, baby sip.

&gt;“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh”

I’m sorry.

Call me pedantic. But it annoyed the living f\*ck out of me.

It didn’t matter what the drink was either.

Tea, coffee, champagne, juice, wine. Anything.

She was one of those “ahhhh” sippers and it was a character flaw I just couldn’t look past.

So I broke up with her. And that was the end of that.

**And also she was sucking some other guy’s dick behind my back for months so there was that too.**","""Have you ever broken up with someone over a single character flaw?""",5

The pharmacist will figure out what to do from then on. And I want you to bed a groupie tonight""

So the next morning, bright and early, the manager starts pacing in front of the drummer's door. Finally the drummer comes out and the manager is all over him ""So, did you have sex?""

As he was conducting however, he accidentally got distracted and somehow made the train crash into an office and killed 7 people. 

He had to go to court of course and the jury declared him as guilty and the judge gave him the death sentence.

The day finally comes and he enters the electric chair room. They ask for his last meal and he asks for one banana. He eats the banana and goes to the chair. They shock him but somehow after the shock he's still alive.

Everyone in the room is like ""Oh wow he lived, welp i guess we'll let him go."" So off he goes back into the world (with a really poor legal system). He decides that he still wants to be a train conductor.

So he goes back to being one, he's so confident nothing will go wrong this time. Aaaand then he crashed again, killing even more people. 

He went back to court again and of course the judge gave him the death sentence. 

He goes back into the death chamber he was once in, and this time for his last meal he asks for just two bananas. He eats them and goes to the chair. They really dont want him to live so they push the electricity even higher this time. However once again he lives. Everyone in the room is so astonished they dont do anything when he walks out.

So this absolute madman decides to conduct trains again. What do you know he messes up again. So he goes to court and all that and he's back in the death chamber. When they ask what he wants for his final meal he says that he wants three bananas. They say ""No you can't have your bananas, every time you've had them you survive the execution."" 

They don't give him his bananas or any other choice for a last meal and throw him into the chair. They crank the electricity up to full power and sparks fly everywhere, the room is filled with smoke. When the smoke clears, he's just sitting there smiling, unscathed. They're so confused and even scared, they ask him how he somehow survived a dose of electricity that should kill anything it touches. His answer?

So after one of their gigs, a man introduces himself, explains that he is a sign-language interpreter, and delivers the invitation on behalf of the club. He tells them he will interpret for them. They accept.

On the night of the planned dinner, there is a terrible blizzard. The minister, priest, and rabbi arrive a bit late, but they are served a delicious dinner. By the end of the meal, they're quite worried because the interpreter is nowhere to be seen. Finally a phone rings. The minister answers it. It's the interpreter, who says: ""Sorry, I'm stuck in traffic. You'll have to go on without me.""

The minister asks: ""How can we do that? We don't know any sign language.""

The interpreter says: ""Don't worry. These people are intelligent and fun-loving. Just improvise something. They'll probably figure out what you mean. And they're not expecting anything profound. They'll be satisfied if all you do is make them laugh. As soon as they laugh, you can stop."" With some apprehension, they agree to try.

The minister goes first. He goes up to the lectern, makes a couple of gestures, and the audience immediately laughs, so he returns to his seat.

The priest and rabbi (who couldn't see from their position on the stage) ask him: ""What did you say?""

The minister says: ""Nothing much. I just started a speech the way I always do. I said: 'Ladies...' [He makes an 'O' with his finger and thumb.] '...and gentlemen.' [With his other hand, he holds up one finger.]. And they laughed, so I stopped.""

The rabbi goes next. He goes to the lectern, makes a few gestures, and the audience immediately laughs, so he sits down.

The minister and priest ask him: ""What did you say?""

The rabbi says: ""Nothing much. I just started a speech the way I always do. I said: 'Ladies...' [He makes an 'O'.] '...and gentlemen:...' [He holds up a finger.]. '...It gives me great pleasure....' [He inserts the finger into the 'O'.] And they laughed, so I stopped.""

The priest plucks up his courage and goes to the lectern. He makes a few gestures and the audience laughs uproariously. He sits down.

The minister and rabbi ask him: ""What did you say?""

When they arrived at the gates, St. Peter greeted them and told them that he’d let them in as long as they don’t step on a duck. Assuming this should be an easy task, the three ladies agree, and St. Peter allows them entry.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as the three see the inside of Heaven, they discover that nearly every square inch of the ground inside is covered in ducks. The three ladies look in disbelief, but as they did agree with St. Peter, they step inside to begin their eternal reward together.

&amp;#x200B;

Only a few minutes pass, and the first lady accidentally steps on a duck. Immediately, St. Peter arrives, chains her to an ugly old man, and takes her away. The other two ladies look at each other, more determined than before to avoid stepping on any ducks.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks pass, and, sadly, the second lady also inadvertently steps on a duck. Like before, St. Peter is instantly on the scene, chains her to an ugly old man, and takes her away. The remaining lady is horrified that the last of her two friends is now gone. She continues alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks go by. Years go by. Remarkably, the third lady has not stepped on a duck. Out of the blue, St. Peter arrives with a handsome young man, chains him to her, and leaves.

Finally the bartender sent his friends upstairs on a mission and they returned shortly. Then the bartender told the cowboy that they only had one woman there but she was upstairs waiting on him. In fact, the bartender’s friends had carried a blow-up doll upstairs and placed her in cowboy’s bed.

The cowboy bid everyone good night and slowly climbed the stairs. Filled with anticipation he approached the room and went inside as the men downstairs listened with great interest. After a few moments, they heard the bed springs squeaking and moans of pleasure coming from the room. Then everything was quiet.

Not being able to sleep with anticipation of the coming morning, the men decided to play poker through the night and await the man coming down the next morning. As he came down the stairs, they noticed a strange look on his face.

They asked, ""Well, cowboy, how was the woman?""

At this point the officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the boot if you want to see.""

The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The senior officer says, ""Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!""

The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.

The officer says, ""Is this your car sir?""

The man says, ""Yes"" and hands over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""

The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""

This house was incredible to the man. It had a pink lawn, a pink picket fence, a pink drive way, and a pink little convertible parked in front of it. He walked up the pink painted stairs and knocked on the pink door. A little old lady came out, her cheeks where as pink as the bushel of pink hair on her head. The man was frantic and said ""Ma'am my car broke down down the road and you are the only home for miles."" The little old lady moves her pink lips saying ""Young man, it is okay you may come in use my phone to call the repair man"" so the man calls the repair company on the pink phone, which sits on a pink doily on a pink table. The repair company says they cannot be there until morning. Man speaks the pink dressed woman and explain the situation. ""It is absolutely okay stay in the room at the end of the hall"" well he opens this pink door and finds a blue room. The room has a blue bed which he sleeps on facing the blue ceiling with the blue fan spinning lazily. He awakes the next day has Apple Jack's in the morning and leaves thanking the woman.


Next day a woman breaks down her car. She spys the same house from yesterday. The difference is it blends in with the forest around it. It has green windows, and green walls. The garden has immaculate green flowers and a green Chrysler is parked in the front. She goes up the green stone path and raps on the green door. A little old lady wearing green makeup with green cat eye glasses comes out. The woman explains her situation. The old lady smiles, and says she understands completely then guides her to a green brick fireplace with a green fire roaring. She spins the green rotary to call the repair shop who explain that it will take a day to get there. The woman explains this to the little old lady who waves her hand ""you can take my room it's the one in the center of the hall."" The woman walks into a bright white room. It has perfectly White Walls, white floor, white bedframe, white sheets. She sleeps and awakes to see the white curtains fluttering. She eats Cheerios and leaves.


Now comes the third day a mans car breaks down. He goes, down and finds a bright blue house with blue shingles and blue vines growing upon it. Tbe man sees a blue cobbled path and takes it right up to the gate. He spys a little old lady in a blue dress, he explains the situation. She smiles with blue teeth and tells him there's a phone on the bar. The man goes to the bar picks up the blue cell phone and dials the repair company. The repair company explain it'll take a day to get there. The man walks on the blue wood floor over blue rugs to explain this. The woman explains she can pull out the blue mattress out of the blue couch and not to worry. Unfortunately in the night the man murders her, and in the morning he gets Apple Jack's then leaves.


On the fourth day another man breaks down, he wanders the area looking for a phone and in the spot where there stood a house just a day before. There sits a rainbow phone with a posted note with the repair companies number. When the man walks down the rainbow path flanked by rainbow grass the rainbows appear around him. He picks up the phone and dials the repair company. They explain it will be a day to get there. As he turns to leave he sees a rainbow headstone with an ingraving that says ""Two out of three people enjoy Apple Jack's for breakfast""",A man's car breaks down...,0

Upon arrival, he comes across a prostitute, she isn’t really all that pretty to look at, she walks up to the boy “it will cost you 10 bucks to ride”
The boy replies “I don’t have any money” the prostitute agrees to take the duck and they go at it

Well an hour passes and the prostitute is out of breath and quite pleased, she smiles and begs him to come back really soon, the boy smiles and nods, the prostitute asks if he wants another round, he agrees and she gives him back his duck, another hour passes and the boy walks away satisfied 

Things are not looking good for the boy and his farmer and got worse, the duck gets spooked and jumps from the boy’s arms and in the way of an oncoming car completely obliterating the duck, the man feels sorry for what happened and hands the kid 50 dollars

Upon closing in on it, the elephant stops trumpeting and looks at the man. There was a minute of intense staring between the two, the man noticed an obvious mark on one of its tusks like a tiny dark grey diamond. Slowly the elephant raises its leg to show the man its hoof. The man sees a metal pole sticking out of it. The elephant keeps its intense gaze upon the man as he slowly makes his way forward.
Upon approaching the elephant the man gives a gently stroke on its leg. The elephant respects this slowly raising and lowering its trunk and seemingly pointing at the pole. The man thinks ‘ok let’s go!’ Grabs the pole and with a swift pull, yanks the pole out and stumbles backwards. The elephant slowly places it’s foot down and gestures his trunk to the man. He gets up and gently strokes it. A few minutes later the elephant turns and walks away.
A year later the man goes to the zoo in his local town with his son. They walk past the elephant exhibit and the man notices an elephant with an obvious mark on its tusk like a grey diamond. “No, surely not” thinks the man. He reads about the elephant apparently being taken from Africa 9 months ago to this enclosure. 
The elephant suddenly looks up and starts to gesture with his trunk. The man realised this could very well be the same elephant. He tells his son to watch as he climbs over the railings into the enclosure. A panicked zoo keeper shouts at him, but he needs to see the elephant again. The man slowly approaches the elephant while it gestures with its trunk. Slowly the elephant starts to lift its leg. His trunk reaches the mans outstretched hand. They touch again gently.

The elephant then grabs the man in his trunk, trumpets loudly and slams him head first into the ground, snapping his neck and killing him instantly.

So in hindsight, it probably wasn’t the same elephant. ",A man walks through the African wild lands and sees an elephant in distress.,5

Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor.  The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days.

The man returns and the doctor says, ""I've got bad news, you've contracted Mongolian VD.  It is very rare and almost unheard of in the US.""  The man is a little perplexed and says, ""well, can you give me a shot or something to fix this?""  

The doctor answers ""I'm sorry, there's no known cure.  We're going to have to amputate your penis.""  The man screams in horror, ""absolutely not! I need a second opinion!""  The doctor replies, "" well, it's your choice but surgery is your only option.""

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he would know more about the disease.  The Chinese doctor examines and says, ""ah, yes, Mongolian VD.  Very rare.""

The man replies ""yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? The American doctor wants to cut off my penis!""

The Chinese doctor shakes his head and says, ""no need, wait two weeks and it will fall off by itself.""",NSFW while in china an American is sexually promiscuous and doesn't use a condom the entire time he is there.,62

The zookeeper explained to the mime that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla, had suddenly died. The keeper feared that attendance at the zoo would fall off. He offered the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they could get another one.

The mime accepted.

The next morning, before the crowd arrived, the mime put on the gorilla suit and entered the cage. He discovered that it was a great job. He could sleep all he wanted, play and make fun of people, and he drew bigger crowds than he ever had as a mime. 

However, eventually the crowds tired of him and he became bored just swinging on tires. He began to notice that the people were paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his.

Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbed to the top of his cage, crawled across a partition, and dangled from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this made the lion furious, but the crowd loved it.  

At the end of the day the zookeeper came and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction as a gorilla.

Well, this went on for some time. The mime kept taunting the lion, the crowds grew larger, and his salary kept going up.

Then one terrible day when he was dangling over the furious lion, he slipped and fell. The mime was terrified. The lion gathered itself and prepared to pounce. The mime was so scared that he began to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind.

Finally, the mime started screaming and yelling, ""Help! Help meee!!!"", but the lion was quick and pounced. The mime soon found himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion.

The lion slowly lowered his snarling mouth towards him and said: ""Shut UP you idiot! Do you want to get us BOTH fired?""

As the cowboy peruses the menu the waiter approaches the woman and asks if she's ready to order. 

""Indeed I am,"" says the woman. ""I'd like sturgeon. Make it a virgin sturgeon. You can check it yourself to be sure. And garnish the plate with a sprig of fresh parsley."" 

""To drink I'd like a tall glass of Chardonnay, cooled to thirty five degrees; use a thermometer if you must."" 

""And could you open that window over there? I smell horse manure. There must be a cowboy nearby."" 

Well, the cowboy hears all of this -- as was the woman's intention -- and he's not too happy.

As fate would have it, the next woman he met was perfect in every way. Soon enough, they fell in love and Joe had never been happier. A year passed and Joe began to wonder if he was wasting the gift he had! And one doubt led to another, and before he knew it he was back on the road to casual relationships.

It was around then that he heard of a strange wise man, who gave every man a single vague advice and yet it would make sense to each seeker in their own way.

The artist agrees and asks the curator if he had any particular subject in mind. 

The curator thinks a moment and tells him he wants the mural to commemorate General Custer's last thoughts. 

The artist agrees and sets to work. He puts up scaffolding and hangs a huge dropcloth so that he may work undisturbed. 

Days turn into weeks, weeks into months and still the artist is at work. Finally one night he climbs down and tells the curator he's finished. They agree to unveil the mural together at the grand opening which the curator hurriedly assembles. 

Finally opening day has arrived and large crowds and plenty of press are on hand. The curator proudly shows everyone around before reaching the still hidden mural. 

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he begins, ""while I've taken great pride and pleasure in having so far shown you our displays it is now time to reveal the most important display of all, a mural commissioned to showcase General Custer's last thoughts!""

The curator turns to the artist who with a bit of flourish pulls a rope dropping the cloth covering the mural. 

The crowd gasps. Cameras flash. 

Upon the wall is a painting of a lake, and from the middle of the lake an enormous turd is rising from the water with an illuminated halo around the top. All around the shores are depictions of Native Americans performing every variety of sex act imaginable. 

Furious and stunned the curator runs to the artist and grabs him by his shirt. Red faced and sweaty he screams at him ""WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ABOMINATION? EXPLAIN YOURSELF!""

The artist calmly backs away and says ""But sir, this is what you asked for, its General Custer's last thoughts....

Holy shit, look at all those fucking Indians!""",The artist and the museum (long),31

A week after they were published, I was contacted by a huge publisher that said they liked my puns so much that they offered to pay me an advance to write a book of puns!

The first book sold extremely well, and that cemented me as a world famous comedian and author. I had several Netflix specials as well as a couple world tours.

It was during one of those tours where I met my wife. It wasn't even during one of my acts. I was just waiting in line at a gelato stand and she struck up a conversation with me.

We had two beautiful children. The first, Michael, was a always curious about the world around him. He loved butterflies and wanted to work at the conservatory. Our second, Julia, was a real handful. She loved running around and hoped to make the national women's soccer team.

Unfortunately Michael was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was seven. He passed away two years later. Even now, forty years after he died, I think about him every day. We bought a plot of land on the butterfly conservatory grounds and planted a hedgerow where we spread his ashes. The butterflies love to land on the branches.

Julia never did make the women's soccer team. Instead, she got a career as a real estate agent and moved to rural Alaska. She made a good living selling huge tracts of land before she met her husband and moved back to our hometown to be closer to family.

My wife and I are nearing our deaths, now. My comedy days are long over. I get asked every now and then to make an appearance or do an interview. Why, just last week I was talking to another reporter who asked about how I got started in comedy.

Reporter: you've had quite a fascinating life. Would you say that everything has gone according to plan?

So they go into the woods and do the deed. After they come out, the prostitute says ""Man, that was a nice fuck. Tell ya what. If I give the duck back, you have to fuck me again."" 

So the prostitute gives the duck back, and they go into the woods again and fuck. 

After they are done, the son heads back towards the county fair to try and make some money. 

Along the way, the duck jumps out of the sons hands and gets run over by a big truck. The driver gets out and says, ""Man I'm real sorry about your duck. Here's $25 so you won't tell my boss."" 

As the day ends, the son goes back home and meets his dad. 

The dad asks, ""Well did ya make anything?"". The son replies ""Well lemme tell ya. I got a duck for a fuck, a fuck for a duck, and $25 for a fucked up duck.""

The man decided “what the hell, I’ll try it!” He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn’t do it in his office. He thought about the bathroom but that was too open. He considered an alley but figured that was too unsafe.

Finally he realized his solution. On his way home he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining his vehicle. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to wank. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to his big finish he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm he kept his eyes shut and replied “WHAT?” He heard “This is the police! What’s going on down there??” The man replied, “I’m checking out the rear axle, it’s busted!” Came the reply, “Well you might as well check your brakes too while you’re down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”",Masturbating before sex,143

They marched perfectly, just how they did in practice. A score of 9. America was the same, but a few mistakes. A score of 8. 


Now came Spains turn. Then suddenly, it was as if they had been practicing for years. It was perfect, as if they were robots. Each footstep was at the exact same time as the others. Their body movement was amazing to watch. A score of 10.


After the contest the American and Russian marching leaders asked the Spain leader how they did it.
