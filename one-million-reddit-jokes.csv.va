A 3rd grade class goes to the swimming pool.

The lifeguard asks to the class: ""Does any one of you already know how to swim?""

Then the little Dimitri, all excited, answered: ""Yes! I do!""

The thing is, the little Dimitri has no arms.

So the lifeguard doesn't really trust him but the little Dimitri insists: ""Yeah yeah I can assure you!""

The lifeguard finally tells him to give it a try.

Unexpectedly, the little Dimitri swims very well. To the point that the lifeguard asks him: ""Where did you learn to swim like that?!""

Little Dimitri: ""Oh I have experience. Each week-end my father brings me to the coast, throw me into the water and I have to get back to the shore really quick.""

Lifeguard: ""Well... It's a little bit harsh for a method, don't you think?""

Little Dimitri: ""Oh no it's not that big of a deal. The most difficult part is to get out of the plastic bag"".

*Because some of you were asking for it. The french version:*

C'est une classe de CE2 qui va à la piscine.

Le maître nageur leurs demande alors : « Est-ce que l'un d'entre vous sait déjà nager ? »

Là le petit Dimitri saute de joie et s'exclame : « Moi j'sais nager !»

Sauf que le petit Dimitri... Il n'a pas de bras.

Le maître nageur est dubitatif mais le petit Dimitri insiste : « Ah si si je vous assure je nage hyper-bien ! »

Le maître nageur lui dit alors de lui montrer mais que s'il y a le moindre problème, il n'est pas loin.

Le petit Dimitri saute alors dans la piscine et nage incroyablement bien. Tout le monde est estomaqué.

Le maître nageur lui demande alors : « Où as-tu appris à nager comme ça ? »

Le petit Dimitri : « Oh ben c'est facile. Tous les week-end mon père m’amène en bord de mer, me lance dans l'eau et je dois revenir le plus vite possible sur la côte. »

Le maître nageur : « C'est bien mais... C'est un peu dur comme méthode, tu trouves pas ? »

Le petit Dimitri : « Oh ça c'est rien ! Le plus difficile c'est de sortir du sac plastique ! »

More than anything they needed red ink for the illustrious X's that will mark the location of the unbound riches of their future. A well known calligrapher lived in the area and Clumsy Edward knew just how to get their much-needed red ink!   
   ""Put ye hands out and I can vault into the window he keeps open, Cap'n. In an out real quick-like, sir! Ink an everything!""   
   Clumsy Edward's plan was foolproof. The night had come and Captain Normal Beard and Clumsy Edward were outside the calligrapher's home. All according to plan, the window the duo had planned to use was open and the home was dark. Normal Beard interlocked his fingers as if he'd done it hundreds of times before and Edward was in the window in no time.  
   Here's where the issue arises.   
   Clumsy Edward, claiming his name once again, had only put enough forethought into the operation to get into the window. He was unaware of the layout of the small one-room home the calligrapher lived in. He was incredibly unaware that the calligrapher did all of his work right under the window and that he had neglected to put away his work from earlier the night. Clumsy Edward falls through the window and lands onto the table with a loud crash, alerting the neighboring citizens. ""Argh, I done crash't into the table an spill't the ink, Cap'n! I'm cover't innit!""
Upon hearing the commotion a nearby group of men ran to the scene to find Clumsy Edward leaving the home covered in ink. Black ink on his face. Blue across his entire torso. Red ink covering his arms and hands. 
Unfortunately, Clumsy Edward and Captain Normal Beard's dream to be wealthy pirates was known to the community and no one believed that Clumsy Edward would do something of his own fruition.   
After the fallout of their plan, Captain Normal Beard went to the local tavern to attempt to drown his sorrows unaware of the fate that befell his matey.   
   Mid-drink Clumsy Edward was thrown into the tavern followed by his captors. Upon making eye contact with his Captain, Edward immediately and profusely apologized. Seeing this, Edward's captors seized Captain Normal Beard and showed him the evidence against him. The black ink on Edward's face. The Blue in across his torso. And finally, the red ink covering his arms and hands. ""We believe Edward here to have broken into the calligrapher's home with your instruction, Normal Beard. What do ye say to these accusations?""  
   Captain Normal Beard was completely stunned, unable to come up with a good reason for their predicament. 
Normal Beard knew that he and his matey had been caught and they would surely hang for destruction and theft. His dream of becoming a pirate was over before it started to come to fruition. Being a man of his word, never lying, yet still sour over the outcome of the night said but one thing to the men..  
   ""Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!""  




   **EDIT:**   
First post, long time redditor. I was unaware as to how long this would be. I just thought of the punchline and came up with a story on the fly. I hope at least one person gets a chuckle out of it, although I doubt it warrants a laugh or a bellow with how lengthy it is and how weak the punch is. Nevertheless, hope someone enjoys it and ANY criticism is more than welcomed. I have aspirations to possibly become a stand up comic, but of course not with jokes like this seeing as how it is far from suited for that kind of venue. Any way to shorten this joke is also extremely welcome. More so than any criticism, whether it be constructive or not.   


   *Post Edit TL;DR*  
A pirate captain, Normal Beard, and his matey, Clumsy Edward, attempt to steal ink to make treasure maps. They break into a calligrapher's home with the matey clumsily falling and getting covered in ink, in particular, red ink on his arms and hands. The matey is caught and brought to the pirate captain by his captors who then interrogate the captain of his suspected crimes, bringing up the ink on his cohorts arms and hands. Being a man who doesn't lie, yet is still flustered the captain proclaims, """"Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!""

He immediately left everything and flew back home. He loved his cat very much and was devastated by his death. He gave the cat a proper funeral, and then was prepared to go back to work again...
Before leaving, he met his neighbor. He told him, ""Thanks for letting me know. But you know, if something like this happens to someone in the future, you should not break the news like that, I could have got a heart attack, you know! You should always break such news slowly. For example, you could have sent me a mail saying, 'Hey John! Your cat is doing great, just today I saw it climbing the tree behind your home.' Then another in a while, 'Hey John, I am afraid there has been a bad storm, and the tree behind your house has fallen down'. Then, 'Bad news John, it seems your cat was stuck in the tree when the storm came... He is badly hurt and we are taking him to the vet now'. And then finally another mail, 'I am very sorry John, but we could not save your cat'.
In this way, I would have been more prepared for the bad news""

His neighbor said, ""I am sorry John, you are absolutely right. I will keep this in mind""

So John goes back to work, trying to forget his grief of losing the cat.

A couple of months later, he gets another e-mail from his neighbor. ""Hey John, hope you are doing great! Just had a visit from your mother. She is climbing the tree in our backyard now!""

The Priest, who is irked the Nun is taking so long takes a puff of his cigar and says.

""Lets go sister, just hit the damn ball!""

The Nuns does just this and executes a perfect drive down the fairway. The Priest strides up and quickly, without praying, hits his ball. His drive slices to the left and his ball disappears into the trees.

""SHIT I MISSED!!""

""Father?!?! You shouldnt use such vulgar language!! May the lord strike you down where you stand!!""

""Father you musnt use such language!! May the Lord strike you down where you stand!!""

One day, the male fly goes up to one of the female flies and says, ""Hey, I know how to get out of this jar."" The female fly asks, ""Really?! How??"" The male fly replies, ""Fuck me and I'll tell you."" The female fly thinks it over for a second then agrees. 

The flies have sex and afterward, the male fly says, ""So here's how you get out of the jar: fly to the top of jar, fly around in a circle three times, then dive straight for the bottom. Right before you hit the bottom, pull up, go straight up, and you'll pop through the top of the jar."" 

So the female fly tries this. She flies to the top of the jar, around in a circle three times, dives to the bottom, and right before she hits the bottom, pulls up, goes straight up, hits the top of the jar and SPLAT, dies. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few days later, the male fly goes up to the other female fly and says ""Hey, I know how to get out of this jar."" The female fly asks, ""Really?! How??"" The male fly replies, ""Fuck me and I'll tell you."" The female fly thinks it over for a second then agrees. 

The flies have sex and afterward, the male fly says, ""So here's how you get out of the jar: fly to the top of jar, fly around in a circle three times, then dive straight for the bottom. Right before you hit the bottom, pull up, go straight up, and you'll pop through the top of the jar."" 

So the female fly tries this. She flies to the top of the jar, around in a circle three times, dives to the bottom, and right before she hits the bottom, pulls up, goes straight up, hits the top of the jar and SPLAT, dies. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few days later the male fly gets bored and leaves the jar.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the person you're telling it to will ask how the fly got out of the jar. So you say, ""Fuck me and I'll tell you!""


-- It may take a few minute for the person to bite. After the male fly leaves the jar, treat that as the end of the joke and sip your drink or do whatever you were doing beforehand. The person will sit and think it over for a second before admitting to being confused. Then you ask, ""Confused about what?"" and then they ask ""How did the fly get out?""

It started off innocent, like farting on the fire, or stealing the cooks whiskey. But as the week rolls on, the dares slowly get worse as each of the cowboys try to win the battle. As they entered town, one stinking of manure and looking to one up his friend, they decide to go to the saloon for a drink. And he sees it, a dirty old spittoon sitting under the bar, glistening in the evening light. ""Hey Kevin,"" he proclaims ""I dare you to drink the contents of that spittoon there."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin, not looking to be called a wuss quickly accepts and struts over to the spittoon. He grabs it and has to peel if off the floor, leaving a spot that hasn't seen sunlight for years. He takes a quick whiff to see what he's getting into and dry heaves. But he quickly pulls himself together, cleans some dried spit off the rim with his sleeve, puts his lips to the rim and tilts his head back. At this point the smell hits the whole saloon, just straight purification, clearing most of the clientele out, covering their mouths and seeking fresh air. Joe begins gulping down the contents, heaving and convulsing after every swallow, letting excess run down his chin and chest. Down his front is just this rotten, pussy, brown and black swirled slime, with chunks of chew and butts falling and splatting on the floor. 

&amp;nbsp;

After a minute of this his friend eyes watering and mouth dropped open comes to with a fresh whiff of rancid eggs. He heaves and cries ""Kevin, stop, that's enough, you win! I cant stand it anymore, you have to stop."" At this point, Kevin tips his head back farther and starts drinking more, letting more pussy sludge run around the edge of the spittoon. His friend seeing this looses it and runs outside to vomit. Five minutes later Kevin comes outside, green in face, empty spittoon in hand, and completely soiled with rotten mucus and spittle. Everyone in town is crowded around the entrance to the saloon curious about what was happening, covering their mouths trying to protect themselves from the disease the man is radiating. His friend slowly stands up, cleaning the vomit from his mouth and asks, ""Why didn't you stop? I said you won.""

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin looks his friend square in the eyes and flatly responds, ""It was all one piece.""",This one made my dad throw up.,2

This farmer had just inherited some of money from his brother's recent death. He couldn't decide which son he could send to college, since he could only afford to send one. 

This farmer also had two ducks. These ducks were retarded. They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal. He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college. 

The sons went out in attempt to collect as much money as they could. The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard. The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks. He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck. The son decided this was very good, so he took it. He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success. 

The second son was walking and passed a whorehouse. He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck. One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore. The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again. She agreed. After they f**ked the second time, the son left. 

He was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash. The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car. The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely. The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck. She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off. 

When the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got. He proudly displayed the 10 dollars. The farmer was impressed. He asked the second son the same thing.

He inserted his penis into the equipment, turned the switch on, and voila, everything else was automatic! He really had a good time as the equipment provided him with as much pleasure as his wife did. However, when the fun was over, he found that he could not take the instrument off. He read the manual, but did not find any useful information. 

He tried every button on the instrument - some made the equipment squeeze, shake, or suck harder or less - but still he had no success getting out of it. Panicking, he just barely reached the phone and called the supplier's customer service hotline. 

The farmer: ""Hello, I just bought a milking machine from your company. It worked fantastic. But how can I take it off from the cow's udder?"" 

Customer Service: ""Don't worry. The machine was programmed to release automatically after collecting about 2 gallons of milk.""

The people did some research and found that they could buy a cow from Moscow for 2,000 rubles, or one from Minsk for 1,000 rubles. Being frugal, they bought the cow from Minsk.

The cow was wonderful. It produced lots of milk all the time, and the people were amazed and very happy.

They decided to acquire a bull to mate with the cow and produce more cows like it. Then they would never have to worry about the milk supply again.

They bought a bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow.  However, whenever the bull came close to the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he could not succeed in his quest.
The people were very upset and decided to ask the rabbi, who was very wise, what to do. They told the rabbi what was happening:

""Whenever the bull approaches our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. An approach from the side and she just walks away to the other side.""

The rabbi thought about this for a minute and asked:

""Did you buy this cow from Minsk?""

The people were dumbfounded. They had never mentioned where they had gotten the cow.

""You are truly a wise rabbi. How did you know we got the cow from Minsk?""

The rabbi answered sadly, ""My wife is from Minsk.""",There once was a cow from Minsk,155

Hopefully the fine members of this sub can:

1.  help me name this *type* of joke to make my search easier, or
2.  point me to the perfect subreddit I didn't find yet, or
3.  tell me that a good campfire joke-teller can expand any joke into the type I'm looking for.

Now, what I'm after are jokes that are family friendly, can be easily expanded based on the creativity of the teller, and have a simply understood pun or punchline at the end to generate a good groan/giggle for 7-70.

I found a few examples of short versions of jokes I have told in the past that I've expanded quite a bit with creative ""backstory"":  

*  [A snail walks into a car dealer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1uia6a/a_snail_walks_into_a_car_dealership/)
*  [A story about a rope](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1fz0k9/a_story_about_a_rope/)

Friday evening with a beautiful much younger gal at his side. He
told the jeweler he was looking for a special ring for his girlfriend.
The jeweler looked through his stock and brought out a $5,000 ring.

The man said, ""No, I'd like to see something more special.""

At that statement, the jeweler went to his special stock and brought another ring over. ""Here's a stunning ring at only $40,000,"" the jeweler said.

The lady's eyes sparkled and her whole body trembled with excitement. The old man seeing this said, ""We'll take it.""

The jeweler asked how payment would be made and the man stated, ""By check. I know you need to make sure my check is good, so I'll write it now and you can call the bank Monday to verify the funds; I'll pick the ring up Monday afternoon.""

On Monday morning, the jeweler angrily phoned the old man and said, ""Sir...There's no money in that account.""

''I know,"" said the old man..., ""But let me tell you about my weekend.""

After two hours, and after they have sworn on their tortoise Lives that they will not eat the sandwiches, he finally agrees. So Les sets off down the road at a steady pace.

Twenty days pass and he still isn't back and Mick and Alan are starving, but a promise is a promise.

Another five days and he still isn't back, but a promise is a promise. Finally they can't take it any longer so they take out a Sandwich each, and just as they are about to eat it, Les pops up from behind a rock and shouts........

The man replied...

""Well your Honor, it was like this: When the lady got on the bus, I couldn't help but notice her condition.

She sat under a sweets sign that said, ""The Double Mint Twins are Coming"" and I grinned.

Then she moved and sat under a sign that said ""Logan's Liniment will reduce the swelling"", and I had to smile.

""I cant do that either, I stole this car.""

""Yeah, I stole it and I killed the owner too, she's in the trunk if you want to take a peek.""

Hearing this the officer backs away from the car window slowly while reaching for his shoulder radio to call in backup... 3 minutes later seven cruisers have the car surrounded.

An older captain in charge arrives on the scene and advises for everybody to stay calm, he approaches the vehicle with his hand firmly planted on his gun and tells the driver to slowly exit his vehicle with his hands up.

""Why, sure sir, no problem"", says the man in the car as he exits. 

""My officer tells me you have a dead woman in the trunk.""

""Well, that's ridiculous"", said the man while he opens the empty trunk.

The baffled captain asks the man where he stole the car.

""Stole the car? No this is my car.""

The driver hands over his registration to the captain and reaches for his wallet to produce his drivers license to prove that its his car.

""Well sir, I'm confused, my officer told me your drivers license was taken away, that you stole this car and had murdered the driver.""

""Ha! I bet that lying sunuvabitch also said I was speeding.""

Along came the sheriff in his boat. He pulled up alongside and said, ""Good morning, ma'am. What are you doing here?"" ""Reading a book,"" she replied, thinking, ""Is this guy blind or what?""

I walked around with her as she tried on several expensive outfits.
She couldn't decide which one to take, so i told her we would just buy them all.

She wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so i surprised her by telling her to just get a pair of shoes for each cloth she selects.

We went over to the jewelry section where she picked'out a pair of gold earrings.
She was so excited, she also asked for a Bracelet and a Wrist'Watch, and i surprised her further when i replied...""That's Okay Honey, You Can Have Them All"".

Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said....""I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier"".

This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. 
He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. 
Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.",So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle.,3
