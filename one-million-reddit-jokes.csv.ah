I recall my first time with a condom, I was 16 or so. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. 

There was this beautiful woman Assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. 

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I answered honestly ""No, this is my first time.""So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was empty.

""Just a minute,"" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside.
""Do these excite you?"" She asked. Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. 

As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. Well, come on"", she said, ""We don't have much time."" 


So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW. I was done within a few moments. She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ""Did you put that condom on?"" She asked. 



I said, ""I sure did,"" and held up my thumb to show her.

post,fjqo4p,2qh72,jokes,false,1584386502,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fjqo4p/the_smartest_and_dumbest_dog/,self.jokes,,"A butcher is very busy working at the meat counter when he notices a dog in his shop. He shoos him away, but the dog returns a while later. He walks over to the dog and sees that he has a note in his mouth. He takes the note and reads it, ""Can I please have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb. The dog has money in his mouth as well.""
The butcher looks in the dog's mouth and, sure enough, there's a ten dollar bill. He takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth. The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the dog. So, off he goes.
The dog walks down the street and comes to a crossing. He puts the bag down, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following him.
The dog then comes to a bus stop and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks the times and sits on one of the seats to wait for the bus.
A few minutes later, a bus comes along. The dog walks to the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on.
The butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels through the town and out to the suburbs. Eventually, the dog gets up and moves to the front of the bus. Standing on his hind legs, he pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off the bus, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still following.
They proceed down the road until the dog turns up the path to a house. He walks up the path and drops the groceries on the step. He then walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door again.
There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to a window and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door and starts yelling and screaming at the dog.
The butcher quickly runs up and stops the guy. ""What the heck are you doing? This dog is an absolute genius. He could be on TV, for goodness sake!""
The guy glares at the butcher and says, ""Genius, my eye! This is the second time this week he has forgotten the key",The smartest and dumbest dog.,0

It is the best and most expensive car in the world, and it sets him back $1.24M. He takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops for a red light. An old man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him. The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?""
The young man replies ""A 2005 Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It cost $1.24M.
""That's a lot of money"" says the old man, shocked. ""Why does it cost so much?
""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the cool dude proudly.
The moped driver asks, ""Can I take a look inside? ""Sure,"" replies the owner.
So, the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning back on his moped, the old man says ""That's a pretty nice car, all right!""
Just then, the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 320 MPH.
Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoossh! Something whips by him, going much faster!
""What on earth could be going faster than my 16.4?"" the young man asks himself.
Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! And, it almost looked like the old man on the moped! ""Couldn't be,"" thinks the guy. ""How could a moped outrun a Bugatti?""
Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh Ka-BbblaMMM! It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The young man jumps out, and good grief, it is the old man!!! Of course the moped and the old man are hurting for certain. He runs up to the dying old man and says, ""You're hurt bad! Is there anything I can do for you?""

The painter hated communism, but he agreed to do it on the condition that he will have total artistic freedom and everyone will see the finished work at the grand reveal. 

After months of work in secrecy it was time for the reveal in front of the party officials and media. So he pulled off the covers to reveal the painting of man with bushy mustache having sweaty, passionate sex with a woman. In the window behind them the Red Square was visible.

As the audience erupted in a riot, the head of the party grabbed the painter and shouted: ‚ÄúThis is an outrage! Who is that man in the painting?‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe man?‚Äù Replied the painter, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs Stalin‚Äù. ‚ÄúWell, who is the woman??‚Äù, the party head asked. ‚ÄúThe woman is Lenin‚Äôs wife‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut where‚Äôs Lenin?!‚Äù. ‚ÄúLenin is in Poland‚Äù, replied the painter.",Lenin in Poland,8

He had a large pond in the back.

It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, 
horseshoe courts, and some apple and peach trees.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been 
there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back 
some fruit.

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee.

As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. 
One of the women shouted to him, ""We're not coming out until you leave!""

The old man frowned, ""I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim 
naked, or make you get out of the pond naked.""

Holding the bucket up he said, ""I'm here to feed the alligator.""

A short time later the waitress returns with the order ‚ÄòThat will be $9.40 please,‚Äô and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, ‚ÄòA hamburger, fries and a coke‚Äô

The ostrich says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll have the same.‚Äô

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.

‚ÄòNo, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,‚Äô says the man.

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. ‚ÄòExcuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?

‚ÄòWell,‚Äô says the man, ‚Äôseveral years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes.

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.

""Welcome to heaven,"" says St.. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

""No problem, just let me in,"" says the Senator.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

""Really? I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the Senator.

""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.

The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.

In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.

They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.

They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, ""Now it's time to visit heaven.‚Äù

So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.""

The Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.""

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell...

Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground.

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.

""I don't understand,"" stammers the Senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?""

The devil smiles at him and says,

""Yesterday we were campaigning,

Today, you voted..""",Heaven or Hell,34

'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.

You have to be old enough to remember Abbott and
Costello, and too old to REALLY understand computers, to fully appreciate
this.
For those of us who sometimes get flustered by our computers, please read
on...

If Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were alive today, their infamous sketch,
'Who's
on First?' might have turned out something like this: 

COSTELLO CALLS TO BUY A COMPUTER FROM ABBOTT 

ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?

COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den and I'm thinking about
buying a computer.

ABBOTT: Mac?

COSTELLO: No , the name's Lou . 

ABBOTT : Your computer?

COSTELLO : I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.

ABBOTT : Mac?

COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou .

ABBOTT : What about Windows?

COSTELLO : Why? Will it get stuffy in here? 

ABBOTT : Do you want a computer with Windows?

COSTELLO : I don't know. What will I see when I look at the windows?

ABBOTT : Wallpaper.

COSTELLO : Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software. 

ABBOTT : Software for Windows?

COSTELLO : No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write
proposals, track expenses and run my business. What do you have?

ABBOTT : Office.

COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything? 

ABBOTT : I just did.

COSTELLO : You just did what?

ABBOTT : Recommend something.

COSTELLO : You recommended something ?

ABBOTT : Yes.

COSTELLO : For my office? 

ABBOTT : Yes.

COSTELLO : OK, what did you recommend for my office?

ABBOTT : Office.

COSTELLO : Yes , for my office!

ABBOTT : I recommend Office with Windows.

COSTELLO : I already have an office with windows! OK, let's just say I'm
sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need? 

ABBOTT : Word.

COSTELLO : What word?

ABBOTT : Word in Office.

COSTELLO : The only word in office is office.

ABBOTT : The Word in Office for Windows.

COSTELLO : Which word in office for windows? 

ABBOTT : The Word you get when you click the blue 'W'.

COSTELLO : I'm going to click your blue 'w' if you don't start with some
straight answers. What about financial bookkeeping? You have anything
I can track my money with? 

ABBOTT: Money.

COSTELLO : That's right. What do you have?

ABBOTT : Money.

COSTELLO : I need money to track my money?

ABBOTT : It comes bundled with your computer.

COSTELLO : What's bundled with my computer? 

ABBOTT : Money.

COSTELLO : Money comes with my computer?

ABBOTT : Yes. No extra charge.

COSTELLO : I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?

ABBOTT : One copy.

COSTELLO : Isn't it illegal to copy money? 

ABBOTT : Microsoft gave us a license to copy Money.

COSTELLO : They can give you a license to copy money?

ABBOTT : Why not? THEY OWN IT!

(A few days later)

ABBOTT : Super Duper computer store. Can I help you? 

COSTELLO : How do I turn my computer off?

ABBOTT : Click on 'START'........",Abbot &amp; Costello,20

One of the friends pull out a bong and they all take hits until they're stoned.
                       
While stoned they come up with an idea to have fun with the horse.
                      
They attach a feeding muzzle onto the horse and funnel in smoke from the bong.
                                                   
Eventually, they detach muzzle the horse and the horse's eyes get bloodshot, it is visibly high.
                            
As a consequence, the horse starts talking:
                      
""You have awakened me"", the horse says.
                        
The stoners, shocked, reply, ""whoa, you can talk?"" In unison.
                   
The horse proceeds to tell them that they must jerk him off or die.
                 
The first stoner says ""nuh-uh, i aint like that"", and the horse mauls him and chews his face, killing him slowly.
                        
The second stoner tries to escape, screaming ""Id rather die than jerk off a horse!""
                         
The horse opens a safe, takes out a shotgun, and unloads a shell into the second stoner, making him slowly bleed out to death.
                     
The third stoner, horrified, approaches the horse and fulfills the act until the horse is finished. The horse then spares the third stoner, and leaves him a diamond worth a great fortune.
                   
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should get off your high horse.",3 stoners buy a horse,79

The woman stifles a laugh tells her husband not to put his penis in the pickle slicer.

A few weeks go by, and the man only wabts to put his penis in the pickle slicer more and more, so he goes to his manager, to ask for help, and the manager refers him to an occupational therapist and gives him some time off.

So one day the man comes home to his wife and says with a sigh, ""Honey, I got fired today. I put my penis in the pickle slicer.""

She gasps, crying out ""oh my god! You have to go to the hospital!""

The man looks up at her, ""Oh no, I'm perfectly fine. I feel great, actually.""

Man is not convinced, he starts climbing the fence, and the dwarf pulls him once again. He tells him ""Hey man, listen to me now, I don't say this to a lot of people, but ever since childhood, I had these powers, see I'm a magical dwarf. I have ability to change things and make everything right for another human being, but it comes at great cost for me, I have to live in great pain for a long period of time so I don't do it often.

Man thinks to himself, what is one blowjob, if it doesn't work out I'm going to kill myself anyway, there is nothing to lose.

First he sees a car overturned by the side of the road and begins to write on his form: ‚Äúk-a-r in d-i-c-h.‚Äù He pauses, thinks to himself, ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt look right‚Äù, scratches out the ‚Äòk‚Äô, replaces it with a ‚Äòc‚Äô and crams a ‚Äòt‚Äô between the ‚Äòi‚Äô and ‚Äòc‚Äô, and reviews his work. It now reads ‚ÄúCar in ditch.‚Äù Yup, he thinks, that looks right.

So he looks around the scene some more and discovers a headless body by the side of the road and begins to add to his report: ‚Äúb-o-d-e-e in d-I-t-c-h.‚Äù He pauses, thinks to himself, ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt look right‚Äù, scratches out the ‚Äòe‚Äôs‚Äô and adds a ‚Äòy‚Äô. Again he looks over his report. It now reads ‚ÄúBody in ditch‚Äù. Yup, he thinks, that looks right.

Finally, he takes one last look around the site of the accident. He notices, lying on the road, the unfortunate person‚Äôs head. He begins to write on his report: ‚ÄúH-e-d on b-u-l-i-v-a-r-d.‚Äù Again, he pauses, thinks to himself, ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt look right‚Äù, and begins to edit:

‚ÄúH-e-A-d on b-o-l-e-v-a-r-d....‚Äù

‚ÄúH-e-a-d on b-u-l-l-y-v-a-r-d....‚Äù

Ole's car was hit by a truck in an accident. In court, the trucking company's lawyer was questioning Ole.

'Didn't you say, sir, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine, ?' asked the lawyer.

Ole responded, 'Vell, I'll tell you vat happened. I had yust loaded my favorite mule, Bessie, into da.....'

'I didn't ask for any details', the lawyer interrupted. 'Just answer the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?

Ole said, 'Vell, I had yust got Bessie into da trailer and I vas driving down da road... ..

The lawyer interrupted again and said, 'Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.'

By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Ole's answer and said to the lawyer, 'I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule, Bessie'.

Ole thanked the Judge and proceeded. 'Vell, as I vas saying, I had yust loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into da trailer and vas driving her down da highvay ven dis huge semi-truck and trailer ran da stop sign and smacked my truck right in da side. I vas trown into one ditch and Bessie vas trown into da other. I vas hurting real bad and didn't vant to move. However, I could hear Bessie moaning and groaning.

'Shortly after da accident da Highway Patrolman, he came to da scene.. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he vent over to her'..

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

In order to make the transition as easy as possible, I have prepared my home office so remind me of work.

* I've purchased a piece of Limburger cheese and placed it on a plate in the middle of the room to remind me of the smell of certain colleagues I'm now prevented from seeing.
* I've placed a few pieces of cardbord in all window panes in order to produce a draft.
* I've purchased ten portable radios and tuned them to different talk radio channels, adjusting the volume to slightly above normal conversation volume. At least one radio channel host has a loud and penetrating laughter. Half of the channels are allowed some professional content, but no more.
* I've had automatic blinds installed but asked the installer to reverse the motor so the blinds go up when the sun shines through my window and down when it gets cloudy.
* I found a handful of old mobile phones and installed some loud and distinctive ring tones that I found online. I've agreed with my colleagues that they call them a few times per hour, avoiding the temptation to answer them until my colleagues hang up--like in the office.
* For a proper coffee experience, I brew my coffee the day before. Whenever I need a cup of coffee, I reheat the entire bottle in the microwave and pour myself a cup.
* I have purchased both a cooling unit and a heating unit. They are adjusted so that the cooling unit engages at two degrees higher than the heating unit disenages. It is important for them to thus compete against each other, becaues otherwise I won't get a lifelike simulation of the HVAC system in our office.
* I have replaced all of my office plants with wax plants--you know, those plants that are typically arranged in a upright torus and bark covering the soil. They require minimal maintenance, and require only some cuts and adjustments every now and then, thus being treated much like all other life in the office.
* Whenever I begin working on a task, I start an egg timer so that it takes no more than 23 minutes before I get interrupted.
* I've invested in an electrically adjustable desk. I realize that only few people actually make use of this feature but it sends an important message about the company's concern for the well-being of its employees. If your have no pain in your back, then everything is fine.
* I remove all of my personal items, PC connections, etc. from my desk every affternoon, because although I intend to use them all the next morning, I must be reminded that I can never know where I will be placed on the next work day.
* I've printed a number of US letter-sized sheets with text and accompanying stikc men (M/F, of course) that communicate how to be considerate of your employees. This is exclusively to set a proper atmosphere because just like in the office, no-one follows the recommendations.
* I have installed an additional DHCP server on my home network in order to get IP address conflicts.
* It will be expensive, but at least once a week I'll be hiring a construction team to perform noisy work.",[long] My company is locked down and I am required to work from home,65

Another harpoon struck the father as his son gazed at him with terror and disbelief, he watched the life drain from his eyes.

Multiple years later, A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.""

They all agree that if they're to die they might as well die drunk and crack open the first bottle. After they finish it, out comes a genie. The genie tells them he will grant them each their hearts desire. The American says, ""I want to be back in New York with a corner office at my job, overlooking the city, and a beautiful girl on my lap.""

""Shkazoom,"" says the Genie as he nods his head. The American disappears in a poof of smoke. 

Next, the Frenchman says, ""I want to be on the steps of my girlfriend's appartement with a bouquet of roses in one hand and a bottle of the finest champagne in the other.""

""Shkazoom,"" says the Genie again and the Frenchman, too, disappears. ""What about you?"" he asks the Russian.

&amp;#x200B;

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye, He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

Dazed and confused, I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman behind the wheel who asked, ""Are you okay?""

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...

""I'm okay, I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, ""Get in and I'll take you home, so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.""

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that...""

""Oh, come now, I'm a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this...""

We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

One night, Fred offered to make a bowl of ice cream for Agnes while they were watching television.

Fred: ""Agnes, would you like whipped cream on your ice cream?""

Agnes: ""Yes, Fred, I would like whipped cream on my ice cream.""

Fred: ""Would you like peanuts on the whipped cream on your ice cream?""

Agnes: ""Yes, I would like peanuts on my whipped cream on my ice cream?""

Fred: ""Would you like a cherry on the peanuts on the whipped cream on your ice cream?""

Agnes: ""Yes, I would like a cherry on the peanuts on the whipped cream on my ice cream?""

The man leaves the shop but starts to ask himself how does the church know exactly when it is 6am?

So he goes to the church and finds the bell ringer and asks him how does he know when to ring the bells and how does he make sure that he has the correct time

He gets out of the car, throws a hundred at the attendant to fill it and tells him to make sure not to scratch it, then goes inside to buy some snacks. While he's inside, an old hillbilly wearing an old tatter shirt with suspenders putters up to the gas station on a rickety moped, barely making it to the pump. The hillbilly parks the moped and gives the attendant 5 bucks to put in the tank. While he's waiting for the fill up, he looks over and sees the brand new, shiny red convertible Corvette sitting there. He walks up to it, running his hands over the sleek body up to the driver's side, then jumps in and starts feeling all over the plush leather, admiring the knobs and dials. He grabs the steering wheel and pretends like he's racing, yelling out car noises and yanking the wheel back and forth.


The owner comes out of the gas station and sees the hillbilly in his car and freaks out. He runs over yelling ""GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CAR YOU DIRTY HILLBILLY!!"", grabs him by the suspenders, throws him out of the car, gets in and slams the door and races away. The hillbilly gets on his moped and leaves, sad that he didn't get more time in the beautiful car.


An hour goes by and the Corvette is racing down the freeway, it's night now. The driver notices a single headlight in his rear view mirror getting closer, and closer, until a vehicle STREAKS by him. The driver is stunned. He looks down at the speedometer and taps on the dial, glaring at the needle touching 90mph. He rubs his eyes thinking he must be tired and continues looking down the road. Then a few minutes later, he sees the single headlight again, this time coming from the opposite direction. It gets closer, closer, then ZOOM shoots by him. The driver says to himself, ""Is that...that's the old hillbilly from the gas station. He's making fun of me! I have his brand new awesome sports car and he's going faster than me on that stupid moped??""


Then again he sees in his rear view mirror the single headlight, closer, closer, then ZOOM past him. The driver has enough and pulls off to the side of the road. The headlight comes back the other way, zooming past him going back and forth again and again and again until finally the old hillbilly on the moped, his hair and beard stuck straight back from the wind, putters to a stop in front of the Corvette. He gets off the moped gasping for breath, ""GOLLY MISTER I'M SURE GLAD YOU STOPPED, MY SUSPENDERS WERE CAUGHT IN YOUR DOOR!""",(Long) A guy driving a brand new convertible Corvette stops at a gas station to fill up on his inaugural drive,6

At the end of the day the manager checked the day sales and was shocked, the boy had sold $79,083.25 worth of merchandise.

He asked the boy how he did it and he replied: ‚ÄúWell this guy was going fishing so I asked if he wanted some fish hooks. He said sure. That‚Äôs $1. I asked if he had a nice fishing pole. He said no and got a graphite pole for $44. I asked if he had a nice reel. He said no and I got him a reel for $35. I asked where he will be fishing and he said White Lake.

‚ÄúI said the best places to fish are near the centre, and when he said he didn‚Äôt have a boat, I set him up with a 10 metre cruiser for $28,000. I asked if he had a trailer. He didn‚Äôt, so I got him a double axle trailer for $3,000. Then I asked what he had to tow the boat. He only had a station wagon, so I told him that just wouldn‚Äôt do, but we could get him a nice fully loaded Dodge Ram for $48,000. He wanted it all‚Äù.

The store manager was astounded: ‚ÄúAnd to think it all began with that man asking for fish hooks.‚Äù

post,fim7za,2qh72,jokes,false,1584207791,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fim7za/the_cowboy/,self.jokes,,"

A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife.

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but
knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the
newspaper for a ranch hand.

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She
thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she
decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him
around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew
a lot about ranching. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch
was doing very well.

Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, 'You have
done a really good job, and the ranch looks great You should go into
town and kick up your heels.'

The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no
hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering
the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a
glass of wine, waiting for him.

She quietly called him over to her.

Unbutton my blouse and take it off,' she said. Trembling, he did as
she directed.

Now take off my boots.' He did as she asked, ever so slowly.

Now take off my stockings.' He removed each gen tly and placed them
neatly by her boots.

Now take off my skirt.' He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching
her eyes in the fire light.

Now take off my bra.' Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was
told and dropped it to the floor.

Then she looked at him and said, 'If you ever wear my clothes into town
again, you're fired.'",The Cowboy,55
