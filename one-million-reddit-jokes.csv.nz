When it came to the bachelor party, Bo, John and the rest of the guys and driver showed up to drink and wait for entertainment.

A knock was on the door, John opened the door to see a big box at the doorstep.  John opened the big box with the guys and saw it was filled with fidget spinners.  Everyone started yelling, fucking fidget spinners???  John then paused for a minute... ""shit I must have sent the other box filled with midget strippers to the Boy Scout party instead...""

He asked the bartender, ""What's a man gotta do to get his hands on that there grand?""
The bartender explains, ""well, you've got to complete 3 tasks within an hour;
1) You've got to first down a quart of moonshine.
2) Then you've got to go in the back room where my Pitbull is and yank out his bad tooth, he won't let me near it.
3) An lastly, my wife is upstairs, i'll need you to go lay it to her good, she hasn't had any in 8 months.""

The man says, ""well I can do all that, where's the moonshine?""

So the man downs the quart of moonshine and heads to the back room and you can hear the dog squealing and hollering. The man, 10 minutes later comes stumbling out of the room and slurs ""Alright, now where's the bi*ch with the bad tooth?""",A Thousand Dollars,1

From inside they heard the shopkeeper with a Jamaican accent say, ‘You foreigners! Come in. Come into my humble shop..’   

So the married couple walked in. The Jamaican said to them, ‘I ‘ave some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey makes you wild at sex.’  

Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what the man claimed, but her husband felt he really didn’t need them being the Sex God that he was.  

The husband asked the man, ‘How could sandals make you a sex freak?’  

The Jamaican replied, ‘Just try dem on, Mon.’  

Well, the husband, after some badgering from his wife, finally gave in and tried them on.  

As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes, something his wife hadn’t seen before!!  

In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Jamaican, bent him over the table, yanked down his pants, ripped down his own pants, and grabbed a firm hold of the Jamaican’s thighs.  

The Jamaican began screaming: ‘You got dem on de wrong feet!’

So he headed down the road and hired three strong men to help him out and brought them to his coach.

One of the men went behind the carriage and tried to lift. But it was too heavy.  
Then another went to help him, but the carriage was still too heavy to lift.  
The third guy then joined the others and tried to lift.   The carriage went up a little bit but was still not free.

post,6det59,2qh72,jokes,false,1495773225,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6det59/the_publisher_of_the_new_york_times_was_getting/,self.jokes,,"Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of the New York Times, was getting married. Artie had been raised by Episcopalian and Jewish parents, but his bride, Gabby, was a Roman Catholic. Artie wasn't particularly religious, and Gabby's parents were very traditional, so for the sake of a harmonious relationship with his in-laws he agreed to convert to Catholicism before the wedding.

Artie had very little experience with religion, but he took his classes and learned his catechism. He did everything he needed to, and he was even beginning to enjoy the idea of being a Catholic. Soon enough, it was time for the big step -- his baptism.

He was to be baptized along with a large number of other converts, and so when he entered the church it was more crowded than he'd ever seen it. There were so many converts, in fact, that they broke them into two groups and made two single-file lines.

This was when Artie noticed something strange. One of the groups was lined up in front of a large, beautiful stone pool. It was adorned with intricate carvings of biblical scenes inlaid with silver. It was the size of a jacuzzi. And it was watched over by a seven-foot tall sculpture of a beautiful angel holding a sword in one hand and a cross in the other.

The other group -- his group! -- was lined up before a small plastic jug on a wooden table.

At first, he wondered if there was some meaning to the split, if each new convert would somehow use both receptacles. But as he watched, the converts in the other line were led into the great pool of holy water. They were bathed in cool, clear water and blessed by a cardinal. The angel looked down on them beneficently.

In his line, a bored looking priest dipped his fingers in what looked like dishwater and flicked it at the converts.

Artie was put out. He motioned to Gabby and she came over, confused. ""What's wrong?"" she asked.

""This isn't right,"" he said, greatly indignant. ""Why are half of us getting a big ceremony and half of us are getting spat on by some thug?""

Gabby just shook her head. ""You're being ridiculous, sweetheart,"" she said. ""The ceremony doesn't matter. What matters is that after this, we can get married.""

Artie grudgingly admitted this and waited patiently. But as he got closer to the end of the line, he could distinctly smell urine coming from the jug. Each convert in front of him flinched when they were touched by its contents. Meanwhile, the converts in the other line were presented by the cardinal with a full glass of wine. He was talking with them, joking with them, and finally leading them to the pool, from which they emerged refreshed, as if lit from within by a new spiritual light.

Artie motioned for Gabby to come back. ""Look, do they not know who I am?"" he said. ""I'm the publisher of the New York Times, damn it.""

""Arthur!"" Gabby snapped. ""This is a church!""

""Why don't I get to meet the Cardinal?"" he demanded. ""I'm an important person. He might *like* to meet me!""

""You're being ridiculous,"" Gabby said, and turned and walked away, annoyed.

Artie seethed. He was next in line now, and he could see that the priest in front of him was not bored at all -- he was visibly drunk. His vestments were scruffy, he was unshaven, and every now and then he would swig from the foul-smelling jug before them.

In the other line, however, the Cardinal had dissolved the line and had gathered the new converts around him as though they were close friends. The Cardinal pointed to the statue above the pool and let each of the attendees know that this figure would be their guardian angel, and that where she failed, the Church would provide. Each of them, he said, was home now, with family.

""Next!"" shouted the priest, or tried to, before a massive belch swallowed the end of the word. Artie stepped forward, fuming. The Priest reached into the jug, but before he could withdraw it, Artie yelled, ""WAIT!""

The priest turned to stare. The cardinal turned to stare. The entire congregation turned to stare as Artie, boiling with rage, kicked the jug of piss-water over and roared, ""Do you know who I am? I'm Arthur Sulzberger! I own the greatest newspaper in the world! And you put me in the line with this... this *goon*?!""

The Cardinal came over, trying to calm him. ""My son,"" he said. ""The manner of your baptism isn't important to you, surely. What matters is spiritual communion with the church. Your new faith. Your new bride. This symbol of faith is fleeting, but those things are eternal.""

But Artie was not mollified. He looked up at the great statue of the angel, then back at the Cardinal. He roared, ""You've forgotten something, Padre!""

The Cardinal stared. ""And what is that, my son?""

""I own the New York *fucking* times!"" Artie screamed.

""And you *cannot* make the Times' New Roman Catholic use a sans-seraph font!""",The publisher of the New York Times was getting married... (long),0

post,6dd0sr,2qh72,jokes,false,1495751796,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6dd0sr/the_spice_mafia/,self.jokes,,"It is a little known fact that some people want spices that they cannot obtain legally. Be it decades-old oregano, salt from the Last Supper, or the flesh of Sean Spicer, some people love strange and unusual spices. However, in order to obtain these spices, they only have one place to turn: the Spice Mafia, a gang of international criminals who have mastered the art of culinary crime.

When I moved a few weeks ago, I had been warned of the Spice Mafia. I was told to keep my nose clean, and my dishes bland, lest I incur their wrath. I didn't really think much of it at the time.

Two weeks ago, I had gotten out of bed to grab a glass of water, when I heard some strange noises coming from outside. I leaned my head out the window and saw a man digging a hole in my lawn. I yelled at him, and he ran away. Not thinking much of it, I grabbed my water and went back to bed.

The next morning, I went outside and filled in the hole. All through the week, I had some problems with an annoying sneeze. I didn't put that together with the occasional clouds of black dust that would appear when I opened drawers and doors until recently.

A week later, I was woken up by similar noises. I went outside and started yelling. This time there were two of them, but they ran away again. I decided to fill the hole back in then and there, rather than waiting until the morning.

Over the next week, I asked around about what had been going on, and learned about the Spice Mafia. I found out that the local ring was run by one of the toughest Spice Gangsters in the world, Papa Rika. I began planning my counter attack, and preparing for when they came back.

A week later, I was waiting by the window when I saw four men walk up to my lawn. They began digging, just as they had the past two weeks. I let them continue. 

When their shovels were thrown to the ground, I moved. I came out of the house, yelling as loud as I could. They didn't run this time; the four of them together could easily beat me in a fair fight. Fortunately, I had brought the one weapon one can use against the Spice Mafia - Pepper Spray.

As they ran off screaming and crying, I examined the hole they had dug. Inside was a metal box. I took it into the house to examine it further. It was clearly old, and had probably been there since before I moved in. It was also unlocked.

I opened the box to find that it was filled with glass jars. All of them had been filled with ground-up leaves, and were expertly preserved. Examining the labels, I couldn't find one that was less than a century old. I also began noticing that they were all the same spice. That's when I realized...

since I moved in, I've been living on burrowed thyme.",The Spice Mafia,10

As he was walking along he saw a large cargo vessel, with ""the S.S. Truth"" written on the side approaching the harbor.

""Pardon sir..."" , said a man hiding behind the bench.

""...But you may want to hide from the smell...""

The man asked why.

""You see that ship? That's *the truth*""

""Yes, I noticed"" said the man.

""That ship carries many exotic birds. Parrots, Macaws, Great Tits, you name it""

""Great WHATS"" replied the man, thinking he misheard.

""Great Tits, a species of bird known to have quite awful smelling droppings.""

""It's fine. Bird poop doesn't stick around for long.

""I still think hiding away for a bit is a better idea.""

Now Barney was done talking, and was pretty sure he could handle the smell, so he said:

We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid. Bishop Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and
worried. We are okay. Only one of our tents and two sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking
for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is okay. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search
and rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. Bishop Webb got mad at Chad for going on
a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put
gas on a fire the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did; also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird
until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Bishop Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked okay when
we left. Bishop Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's
a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with ten people in a car.
He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Bishop Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver.
In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up here are
logging trucks. This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Bishop Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and
Chad was afraid he would sink because of the cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under
the water from the flood. Bishop Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time
working on the car, so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed off out first aid merit badge. When Dave dove in the
lake and cut his arm we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Bishop Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover
chicken. I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine. 

Love, 
Rob P.S.

The woman did not see what that would hurt, so she said she would. Every day for the next month the couple would sit in the park by the lake and the old woman would hold the man’s penis.

One day the man didn’t show up at their regular meeting place. The woman became concerned and set out to search for him. Further down the shore she spotted him sitting on a bench, with another woman beside him. She walked up to the bench to find his penis in the other woman’s hand.

This upset her very much and she yelled at the old man, “We have been together for 2 months now, I thought we were getting along just fine. Now I find you here with this other woman. What does she have that I don’t?”

“Oh, I see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“Well, I’d like to,” said St Peter, “But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.


As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”

The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”

Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard.

When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother.

A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and I had to poke her arse with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so I grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""",The Worst Mother In Law Ever,1594

The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.

There, he met a lovely young woman, who happened to be the caretaker of the camp. They eventually started dating and were truly in love. One night, the woman asked if he would marry her.

The wedding was not big; the woman's parents disagreed with her marrying this ""unclean"" individual, and the man had no family to speak of in India. After coming back from their honeymoon in America, they decided to have a child. And nine months later, the baby was born, a daughter. She was a beautiful baby and grew up with influences from both Iraqi and Indian cultures. She ate both of their foods, practiced both of their religions, and wore both of their clothes.

Ever since she was a young child, this girl loved to paint. Her works were beautiful with not a single error. Eventually, she turned 18 and was admitted into a very prestigious art school to continue her training. But during the summer, the mother, who had to find a new job after Hussein's execution and became a software designer, had to report to her company's office during the week of her high school graduation. She decided because of this to give her child a parting gift, a crocodile skin handbag, and had the man give it to her.

When she got it, she said, ""Thanks for the Baghdad.""

""Did you buy it?""

After a particularly big fight, he begins to drive around aimlessly. He passes a pet store and is seized by a brilliant idea. He'll get a pet for his wife! Maybe it will make her happy,


He stops and goes in to the store. He wanders around looking at all the different animals. He looks at the fish, the birds, the puppies and kittens. Eventually he reaches the lizards. In the corner of the room is a tank labelled with a sign that says only ""South American Cocksucking Iguana"". He looks hard at the lizard but can't see anything unusual about it.


He goes to the shopkeeper and asks what the deal is with the iguana. Shopkeeper says, ""I'll tell you what. Take it in to the bathroom for five minutes and see for yourself.""


The man is skeptical and a little weirded out, but figures what the hell? Why not? He takes the lizard in to the bathroom. Five minutes later he emerges with the lizard and a giant smile on his face.


""Holy shit, how much is this thing?"" the man asks the shopkeep. 


""Two thousand,"" comes the reply.


""Done,"" says the man with no hesitation. 


He puts the iguana in its tank and packs it carefully in to his car. He drives home and parks in the driveway. As he's walking up the front walk to his house, his wife comes to the door. 


""What the fuck is that?"" she asks.


""It's a South American Cocksucking Iguana!"" the man replies.


""What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?""

So, put the rabbit back in the barn and left everything else on the counter.  She donned her bonnet and boots and decided to head down to the market to buy some onions.

She went straight to Tommy's produce stand.  He always had the freshest vegetables.

""Well, top of the morning to you Mrs. O'Malley!  How does this wonderful day find you?"" Tommy greeted her.

""Ahh, well Tommy, I was going to make a stew for John, but I don't have any onions."" Mrs. O'Malley lamented.

""Well, I'm sorry to say Mrs. O'Malley, but we are fresh out and I don't expect any onions until Thursday."" Tommy replied.

""Oh, well I suppose Ill come back then, Tommy.  Have a good day."" Mrs. O'Malley said.

Well, Tuesday comes and Mrs. O'Malley sees all of her ingredients for the delicious stew are still on the counter.

""Well, I certainly cant make a delicious stew without onions!  Ill head down to Tommy's, he always has the freshest vegetables!"" Mrs. O'Malley claimed excitedly.

So, she donned her bonnet and boots and headed straight away for Tommy's.

""Wellll, its good to see you again, Mrs. O'Malley, and top of the morning to ya.  What can I do for this morning!"" Tommy smiled.

Every month, the Burger King Corporation throws a cheerio employee of the month party. It's always been Honey Nut's dream to go, but Fruity always gets to go. Every. Damn. Month. But not this month- No. This is Honey Nut's chance. And the party's in one week. Our boy Honey Nut works extra hard this month. Washing two times the tables and taking two times the orders, this man is destined for a party.

On Wednesday-the party is on Friday-Honey's boss comes up to him and says, ""Honey Nut! I have great news! Your hard work and dedication has paid off. You get to go to the CHEERIO OF THE MONTH PARTY!!!!!""

""Seriously?"" Honey Nut replies. ""This is fantastic!""

So Honey puts on his Sunday best and goes on his way to the party. When he arrives, he is instantly taken away by this smokin' hot babe frosted Cheerio. Now Honey Nut is a pretty confident dude, despite working at burger king, so he goes to talk to her.

""Hey, my name's Honey Nut, and-"" Suddenly he's cut off by her. She says (insert Valley Girl voice) ""Oh, I only talk to Frosted cheerios."" 

Honey Nut is crushed. He just goes to his table and drinks milk until he's extremely drunk. I mean, what else would you expect a piece of cereal to drink? 

So half a month goes by, and Honey Nut is working harder than ever, cause that's all he knows how to do. One day, his boss comes up to him and says, ""Honey. Have I got the opportunity of a lifetime for you. We just got this machine installed that will frost you. You get the chance to become FROSTED!!!!""

Honey Nut steps into the machine and gets-drumroll please- frosted! So he gets invited to the party, and sees the same babe cheerio. They start talking and she actually gives him her time. She seems interested and they talk for so long. After a while, she gets thirsty so he offers to get her a drink. He goes to get her milk, but the line was too long. He went to get her coffee, but the line was out the door. Then he went to get her some punch and guess what? There was no punchline.


Oops.


       ",So there's this cheerio who works at Burger King...,53

In the case of Donkey and the Dragon, this is true. However, even though the two loved each other, Donkey quickly realized that the differences in their sizes meant that he couldn't please the Dragon with his little Pinocchio.

Wanting the best for his loved one, Donkey travelled all over the land until he found a sex shop. ""I'm looking for something to please my Dragon friend with"", Donkey told the shopkeeper.

""I have just the thing"", the shopkeeper replied, smiling. ""Come with me.""

Donkey followed the shopkeeper into a back room, and found himself in front of an enormous dildo, half the size of the shop. ""This is the Magic Dildo, size XXX"", the shopkeeper said proudly. ""And it's  big enough for even a dragon. But it's not just big. Watch this: Magic Dildo, the wall!""

Immediately the Magic Dildo rose up and began throwing itself against the wall. The entire shop shook and threatened to collapse. ""Magic Dildo, stop!"", the shopkeeper said, and the dildo stopped.

Amazed by this product, Donkey bought the Magic Dildo and brought it home to the Castle. ""Whenever your bored, use this"", Donkey told the Dragon. ""Just say 'Magic Dildo' followed by wherever you want the dildo to go.""

So Donkey left for Shrek's house to give his beloved some privacy. The moment Donkey left, the Dragon used the dildo. ""Magic Dildo, my pussy!"" 

Immediately the dildo entered her pussy, and the Dragon let out a stream of fire in pleasure. At first, the Dragon was beyond ecstasy, but minutes turned to hours, and she couldn't get the dildo out, no matter what she said. Worried, the Dragon flew over to Shrek's house where Donkey was. Her flight was wobbly, but she made it, nearly crashing into Shrek's house.

""For the love of Pete!"", Shrek groaned, walking outside, where the Dragon was rolling on ground, eyes bulging. ""Get......Donkey....Magic Dildo......won't come out!"" 

Shrek guffawed in disbelief. ""Magic Dildo my ass!""

We were going through some basic form information and he was having trouble understanding my spelling so he told me to use the phonetic alphabet. 

For those of you that don't know, the phonetic alphabet is using words in place of letters when spelling something out (like A = Alpha, B = Beta, C = Charlie, etc.)

Now I don't know about you guys but whenever I try to do something like this, my mind just freezes up completely. My mind immediately just goes towards the worst words to use. 

""P..p...uh...perpendicular?""

""E...........ecs...tacy...""

At this point I was getting really nervous. I could tell it was starting to get awkward for him on the other end.


""D...Democratic Party...oh sorry that's two words but I just meant Democratic""


""Orifice"" He had trouble hearing that one so I tried to give another one. ""Oxygen"". 


""Principal"". That one was easy since it was my job at one point.



""Homo...sapien..."" Whew. Close one.


""Inception"". ""Love"". ""E-mail"".

Once again they get a caller who says he has a word that they won't have in their dictionary.

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

All the children X, except Y; he/she Z.

Where X is what all the children were doing, Y is another child's name, and Z is way over the top and rhymes with Y. 

Examples:

All the children were tired, except Jane; she had cocaine.

All the children were innocent, except Bobby; he had bombed the lobby.

The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralysing the country's military capability.

The English are also feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Korea and have therefore raised their security level from ""Miffed"" to ""Peeved."" Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross."" The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorised from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the British issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Fuck Off"" to ""Let's get the Bastards."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the Barbie this weekend!"" and ""The Barbie is cancelled."" So far no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.
