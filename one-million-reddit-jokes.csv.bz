The bartender replies ""You tell me, do you really think I wished for a 12-inch pianist?""",A man walks into a bar and sees a 12-inch pianist.,7

She says “mom, I just pissed out a bullet and I’m freaking out!” She sits down and holds her head in her hands , panicking. The mom figures this was related to that day 19 years previously. She said “honey, don’t worry , I’ll explain what happened...” 

She explains what happened and the daughter , feeling better, goes off back into the party. A few minutes later , her second daughter comes up and the same thing happens. The mom explains again, amazed that this is happening. 
The daughter is relieved and goes to tell her boyfriend she isn’t dying of some weird bullet-related illness. 

A few minutes after that, her son comes up and says “hey mom, you’ll never guess what just happened” and she says “you pissed out a bullet?” 

“No.” He replied “I was masturbating and I shot the dog!”","A woman pregnant with triplets , 2 girls and a boy, was walking down the street when she was shot 3 times in the stomach",13

A couple of people approached all decked out in green. He grunted to himself “green with envy” and pulled back the rope for them. Next came a bouncing ball of pink and feathers and glitter and boobs. He almost barked his greeting, but managed some composure with a slightly too firm “What are you?” Even though he knew. She giggled and bounced and glittered and said “Why tickled pink, of course.” Her feathers felt so soft as she rustled by his post. He settled onto his stool and stared into the distance, remembering her. Slowly he realized two naked men were heading in his direction. He strained to see that each one had something affixed to their penis. As they got closer he saw that one had his junk stuffed into a pear, and the other was sporting a yogurt cup. He wondered if he should call the police when one of them called out “Is this the party?” The doorman said “Yeah but you’ve got to be dressed... as an emotion.” “But we are” they insisted. Dan wracked his brain. “Then what are you?!” The fellows looked at each other, and then one looked back at Dan and said with a sob “Why I’m deep in despair (this pear).” And his friend jeered, “And I’m fucking disgusted (this custard.)” Ba dum bump Schh!

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,27

The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""  
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""  
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.  
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

Sure enough, up in the woods he sees a black bear cub. Don Jr. takes aim, fires and kills the bear dead. He walks up to take a look at the carcass and see if it is big enough for a trophy, when all of a sudden he is tapped on the shoulder. He turns around to find a large black bear right behind him.

""What the hell, Don?"" says the black bear, ""You just shot my kid. Now I am going to have to rip you apart with my teeth and claws.""

""No, please,"" says Don, ""I am too young to die. Is there any other way?""

""Well,"" says the bear, ""If you don't want me to kill you you have to agree to submit to rough animal sex with me.""

Don Jr. doesn't like the idea but he doesn't want to die. ""Okay,"" says Don and just like that the bear is on him. It is rough, terrible and Don Jr. barely survives. He makes it back to the hospital where he is in the ICU for two months. All he can think about is revenge.

When he can finally walk again, Don Jr. heads back to the Canadian woods. He finds the adult black bear that ravaged him, takes aim, fires and kills the bear dead. Don Jr. goes down to the corpse to gloat over it when all of a sudden he is tapped on his shoulder. Behind him is the largest grizzly bear he has ever seen.

""What the hell, Don?"" says the grizzly, ""That was my cousin. I am going to have to shred you from limb to limb with these teeth and claws.""

""No, please!"" says Don Jr, ""Is there any other way?""

""You know the deal,"" says the grizzly.

""Ok,"" Don Jr whimpers. And the grizzly is on him just like that. It is ten times worse than what the black bear did to him. Don Jr. is humiliated, barely able to walk. He has to spend six months in the hospital trying to recover. All he can think about is revenge.

When he can finally walk again, Don Jr. goes straight back to the Canadian woods. He finds that damn grizzly, takes aim, fires and kills him dead. ""That'll show you!"" yells Don Jr. over the corpse of the grizzly, when all of a sudden he is tapped on his shoulder. Don Jr turns around to see the world's biggest Polar Bear who looks at him and says:

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk. The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk. The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk? The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk. 

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth. The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound. 

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door. 
The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

post,dpi1fe,2qh72,jokes,false,1572493206,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dpi1fe/demonic_casket_long/,self.jokes,," Fritz Hoffman was a city boy who had always dreamed of living a rural life. All his years, his eyes turned toward the city limits and expanse of trees and open fields that lay beyond his concrete jungle. Unfortunately, circumstances always seemed to stifle his desire. Whether it was his parent's hatred of all things rural or his lack of financing keeping him chained to his dilapidated inner-city studio apartment, Fritz had resigned himself to believing he would never be able to spend more than a weekend here or there camping in the wilderness. 

Then if by a stroke of luck, all that changed. On one of Fritz's infrequent trips to the country, he happened to spot a decaying for sale sign along a lonely country road. In a whirlwind of activity, he had found his dream property, had his low ball offer accepted, and moved into the life he had always wanted. 

Fritz's drive to work was now significantly increased, but he cared little. In truth, he would have gladly doubled it if it was the only way to have the beautiful two-story farmhouse situated on twenty acres of pristine farmland.  

One night near the end of October on Fritz's drive home, his car began to miss and sputter.  Fritz patted the dashboard and tried to sweet-talk his vehicle into making it the rest of the way. Ignoring his pleas, his car jerked to a stop as it died on that lonely country thoroughfare. Fritz cursed himself for putting off the maintenance he had known was required.  

He stepped out of his dead vehicle and pulled out his cell. The dreaded but not unexpected words of no service blared out from the illuminated screen as the last rays of sunlight faded in the autumn sky.  Fritz turned on his phone's flashlight and shined it on a nearby road sign. It confirmed his worst fears. If he followed the winding road, it was at least a ten-mile trek to his home. He stared into the dark foreboding forest. 

Ten miles following the pavement but only slightly more than one if he cut cross-country.  Fritz took a deep breath to steel his nerves before he started through the thick underbrush.   

The journey was slow. Fritz had to make certain of each step lest he risk twisting an ankle on some hidden root. A beep from his phone signaled that a new day had started, and not just any day but Halloween. Fritz had never been superstitious, but even the most skeptical of persons would have been hard-pressed not to be slightly unnerved by the long shadows cast by the leafless tree branches in the illuminating light of the mobile phone.    

Suddenly it dawned on Fritz that the sound of insects that normally serenaded anyone on a country night had fallen silent. Only the whistling of the wind through the canopy above broke the silence. Then in the distance, a faint thump, thump echoed amongst the trees.

Fritz swung around, looking for the source of the noise. Only tree trunks and dead leaves were to be found. Putting it down to exhaustion and an overactive imagination, Fritz resumed his travels though with a slightly more hurried pace.

After several more minutes the sound of Thump, Thump, once again rang out. This time it seemed closer than before. Fritz once again looked around, training his light in the distance on what appeared to be a rustling bush. A blurred image seemed to be struggling to make its way through the underbrush.  Fritz turned and began to scramble through the remaining length of the forest, stumbling as his he traded caution for haste.      

Just as he reached the tree line **Thump**, **Thump** once again rang out, filling Fritz's ears. Fear gripping him, he dropped his phone and sprinted for the edge of the woods, his heart pounding in his chest as he burst into his expansive front yard.  Scrambling back to his feet, a feeling of relief washed over him. That contentment was short-lived. No sooner had Fritz taken ten steps than **Thump**, **Thump** once again tore through the night. Fritz slowly turned around dread coursing through every vein. From the dark, ominous depths of the forest, an old-timey casket crashed into Fritz's yard.  

Fritz spun in terror and raced for his front porch. The casket in pursuit behind him **Thump, Thump, Thump** as it gave chase. Stumbling across the creaking planks of the deck, he shoved his hand in his pocket, desperately searching for his keys. Fritz yanked them out his hand shaking so violently that he immediately dropped them. **Thump, Crunch, Thump** signaled that the casket had itself made it to the porch the planks cracking under the assault of its maniacal pursuit.   

Adrenalin flowing freely through his system Fritz stooped down and quickly scooped up his keys. He shoved the jagged piece of metal into the lock and twisted it with inhuman speed nearly breaking it off in the keyhole. He yanked the door open. Rapidly, he slid inside before slamming and locking the door behind him.   Fritz breathed a sigh of relief as he took a step back and slumped on the stairs leading to the second floor of his house.

THUMP, CRASH, THUMP reverberated throughout the house as the casket smashed it's way through Fritz's front door. Fritz's eyes went wide with horror as the lid of the sarcophagus flung open and the infernal visage of a half-decayed corpse stared at him its demonic eyes glowing red as if they were channeling the very fires of hell. 

Fritz's crawled up his stairs in a desperate attempt to flee. Thump, Thump, Thump the casket pursued. Almost languidly now knowing its prey was cornered.

Fritz reached the top of the stairs and ran into the first room he came to the hall bath. He closed and locked the door in a futile final effort to save himself from whatever gruesome fate awaited him.

Thump, Thump, Crash the casket destroyed the bathroom door. The corpse was now cacking with the laughter that sounded like it came from Satan himself.

Fritz out of sheer panic, reached for the closet thing to him, a bottle of Tussin, and flung it at his tormentor. His aim was true, and it impacted with a thud against the cadaver. And then just like that, the coffin disappeared.",Demonic Casket (Long),17

post,dphoit,2qh72,jokes,false,1572491229,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dphoit/the_tomato_garden/,self.jokes,,"An elderly man lived alone. He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, since the ground was hard. His only son, Michael, who used to help him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:

Dear Michael,
 I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over.. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.
 Love, Papa

A few days later he received a letter from his son.

Dear Pop,
 Don’t dig up that garden. That’s where the bodies are buried.
 Love,
 Michael

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left. That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

Dear Pop,
 Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That’s the best I could do under the circumstances.
 
Love you,
 Michael

By the time i was a teenager i showed what i now recognize as signs of addiction, id prepare hot water in the morning while i got ready for school and keep it in a thermos id take with me. On breaks between classes id sneak off and crush up some beans to steep with my thermos water. Soon it wasnt just breaks, it was all day, i dropped out of school to pursue coffee full time. I was fortunate enough to get coffee shop jobs here and there but i kept getting fired for stealing the product. The addiction just progressed over the years to the point i was sucking off baristas for a bag of beans a pop. At the end i was just eating the beans. Despite all the years they were still a little too bitter for me, so id always cut it with a little cube of sugar.. and now im here""

For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.

After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoony images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled, thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

Why am I telling you all of this? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.","After my grandfather died, I inherited some of his clothes.",1226

The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.  
Ashley said, 'My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs got broken.'  
'What's the morale of that story?' asked the teacher.  
'Don't put all your eggs in one basket!'  
'Very good,' said the teacher.  
Next little Sarah raised her hand and said, 'Our family are farmers too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. One day we had a dozen eggs, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral to this story is, 'Don't count your chickens before they're hatched'.'  
'That was a fine story Sarah.'  
Johnny, do you have a story to share?'  
'Yes. My daddy told me this story about my Auntie Barbara. Auntie Barbara was a flight engineer on a plane in the Gulf War and her plane got hit.  
She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whisky, a machine gun and a machete.  
She drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then she landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  
She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she  
ran out of bullets.  
Then she killed twenty more with the machete until the blade broke.  
And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.'  
'Good heavens,' said the horrified teacher, 'what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?'

""Sell your farm"" says the voice.

""What?"" goes the farmer.

""Sell your farm"" repeats the voice.

""Is that you God?"" questions the farmer.

""Sell your farm"" repeats the voice, firmly.

""But this farm has been in my family for generations! Why should I sell it?"" the farmer asks.

""Sell your farm"" is the reply from the voice.

&amp;#x200B;

So the farmer puts his farm up for sale and sells everything: the barn, the tractors, the chickens, everything to a corporation.

&amp;#x200B;

On his way to the bank to deposit the check for the farm, the voice appears. ""Cash the check""

""But this is a lot of money to carry around"" replies the farmer. ""I don't know if its safe""

""Cash the check"" is all he hears.

&amp;#x200B;

So the farmer cashes the check and puts all the money into a suitcase.

&amp;#x200B;

Walking around town trying to figure out what to do next, the voice comes back. ""Buy a bus ticket""

Perplexec, the farmer asks the voice where he should go.

""Las Vegas""

&amp;#x200B;

So the farmer buys a ticket to Vegas, gets on the bus and travels all day to get to Sin City.

&amp;#x200B;

When arrives and departs the bus, the voice says ""Go to the Casino"". The farmer obeys.

Once inside, the voice says ""Go to the roulette wheel"". The farmer strolls on over to the crowded table.

""Put it all on 13"" says the voice. 

""All the money"" asks the farmer. ""That's a lot of cash!""

""All of it"" confirms the voice.

&amp;#x200B;

So the farmer drops all the cash onto 13. The crowd gasps at the huge amount of cash. After a quick glance to the casino boss, the dealer spins the wheel and throws the ball. The wheel eventually slows down until it comes to a complete stop. The ball bounces once, twice, then finally settles on number 36.

&amp;#x200B;

And the voice goes ""DAMN IT!""","One day a farmer, out in his field, hears a voice.",3

A group of country friends from the Wildwood Church wanted to get together on a regular basis, socialize, and play games. The lady of the house was to prepare the meal.

When it came time for Tom and Karen to be the hosts, Karen wanted to outdo all the others. Karen decided to have mushroom-smothered steak. But mushrooms are expensive. She then told her husband, ""No mushrooms. They are too high.""
He said, ""Why don't you go down in the pasture and pick some of those mushrooms? There are plenty in the creek bed.""
She said, ""No, some wild mushrooms are poison.""
He said, ""Well, I see varmints eating them and they're OK."" So Karen decided to give it a try. She picked a bunch, washed, sliced, and diced them for her smothered steak. Then she went out on the back porch and gave Ol' Spot (the yard dog) a double handful. Ol' Spot ate every bite. All morning long, Karen watched Ol' Spot and the wild mushrooms didn't seem to affect him, so she decided to use them. The meal was a great success, and Karen even hired a helper lady from town to help her serve. She had on a white apron and a fancy little cap on her head. After everyone had finished, they relaxed, socialized, and played 42 and dominoes. About then, the helper lady from town came in and whispered in Karen's ear.
She said, ""Mrs. Grim, Ol' Spot just died.""
Karen went into hysterics. After she finally calmed down, she called the doctor and told him what had happened.
The doctor said, ""That's bad, but I think we can take care of it. I will call for an ambulance and I will be there as quick as possible. We'll give everyone enemas and we will pump out everyone's stomach. Everything will be fine. Just keep them calm.""
Soon they could hear the siren as the ambulance was coming down the road. The EMTs and the doctor had their suitcases, syringes, and a stomach pump. One by one, they took each person into the bathroom, gave them an enema, and pumped out their stomach.
After the last one was finished, the doctor came out and said, ""I think everything will be fine now."" and he left.
They were all looking pretty weak sitting around the living room and about this time the helper lady came in and said, ""You know, that fellow that ran over Ol'Spot never even stopped.""",Karen served wild mushrooms to the church group.,12

When he got back on shore he went into town to pick up a few things at the grocery. A kind old woman there mistook him for John and said:

“I’m so sorry for your loss. You must feel terrible.”

Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat said:

“Hell no! Fact is I’m sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish. She was always holding water. She had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn’t very good and smelled bad. But they wanted her anyway.

They were curious to see who in this town of everyone-knows-everyone would go up and perform. 

The barman introduced up on stage a couple of highschool kids, the Little Rascals, that were going through the band phase as an opener. It turned out the boys were pretty good and in no time everyone had drinks in their hands and we're enjoying the tunes. 

When the boys finished their set everyone went wild cheering and congratulating them on their performance. If the opener was this good, who was the main event?

The barman then pulled the curtains to unveil the main event. 

A miniature band.

The crowd instantly went from wild to mild and confused. Only the barman knew who this band was.

The moment the band started playing, the crowd riled up again. As small as this band was they could belt out what sounded like they were going to be absolute classics.

""WE COULD LIVE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT IF I HURT YOU I'D MAKE WINE FROM YOUR TEARS""

The crowd went nuts!

""MYSTIFY 
MYSTIFY ME
MYSTIFY
MYSTIFY ME""

The crowd were having the time of their life but we're dying to know who the band was.

A man decides to go to the barman:
""I'll buy you a drink if you tell me who they are""
The barman shook his head.

Another man tries:
""Listen, I'll get you a drink, and you can have my car for a day, hows about it?""
The barman again shook his head.

A woman decides to take up the challenge:
""You can have me, and my twin sister for the night, if you just tell us who they areeeee""
The barman politely declined. 

For the rest of the night people focused more on finding who the band was then on the actual band. The barman was getting fed up.

Finally a man tries his luck, sure of his deal:
""Listen pal, you can have my car for a week, my wife for a day, my house for a month, my job if you want it. Market shares? Yours. These D&amp;G shoes, my wife's Valentino heels, my butler will do your bidding and any single item from my house you choose.

The barman was much past boiling point now.

""OKAY ENOUGH"" he yells, ""THAT'S JUST A LITTLE IN EXCESS""



Edit: I genuinely just thought this up, idek if this makes sense but I swear if it's already on the internet I'll eat my shoe.",Who's that band?,12

The circus is in town! He runs downstairs and asks his father for some money so that he could go see all that the circus has to offer. He father obliges, and the boy runs off to the big top. He buys himself some popcorn and cotton candy, and he is overjoyed when he finds a spot in the front row. He is enthralled by the various acts and becomes giddy with excitement when the clowns come out. One clown in particular stand out. He is wearing the front half of a two man horse costume and seems to be looking for someone. Suddenly the spotlight falls on the boy and the clown approaches him. ""Excuse me"", said the clown. ""Could you stand behind me? Because you look like a horse's ass!"" All the boy could do is stammer. The crowd erupted in laughter. The boy turns scarlet and runs out of the tent, tears streaming from his face. He gets home and hurries to his room, slamming the door behind him. He was so ashamed that he did not have a comeback for that stupid clown. To calm himself, he took out one of his comic books and began reading. Finding himself unable to concentrate on the plot, he flips through to the advertisements and finds the answer to his problems. One of the ads was for the prestigious academy, The Oxford Boarding School for Wit and Retort. It stated that it would teach young boys all that there is to learn about the art of Wit and Retort and all it asked was for an essay and a 20 pound processing fee. The boy immediately went to his desk, smashed his piggy bank, then began writing his essay. The boy took a week of his own summer vacation time to write that essay, and it took another two weeks to hear a response. The Boarding School For Wit and Retort was so impressed by his essay that they offered him a full scholarship to attend there. While there, he dedicated himself and strived to be top of the class in the subject of Wit and Retort.  After a few years he was finished with the Boarding School for Wit and Retort and went on to the Secondary School for Wit and Retort where he once again received a full scholarship. He graduated from the Secondary School for Wit and Retort a valedictorian and went to America to study at Harvard in the subject of Wit and Retort. While there, he turned the whole subject on its head with his expertise and theories on Wit and Retort. His dissertation on Wit and Retort was sung in high praises around the world, he became somewhat of a celebrity in certain circles. By the time he returned home, his name was well known in his town and he even had an article about him in the paper concerning his achievements in the field of Wit and Retort. Soon after he got back, the same circus that broke his heart so long ago returned to town. The boy, now young man, grabbed his coat and made his way to the big top once more. He once again sat in the front row and amused himself with the performances of the circus troupe. After the trapeze act was finished, the clowns made their way to the center stage. There in the center, was the same clown from all those years ago doing the exact same act with the top half of the two man horse costume. He searched around and the spotlight fell on the young man. The clown approaches the man and says, ""Excuse me sir. Could you stand behind me? Because you look like a horse's ass!"" The croud grew deathly silent for the Master of Wit and Retort. The man stood up, cleared his throat, leaned forward, and replied

So a man is on his private jet when suddenly they begin to go down. The pilots begin to look for a place to land and see an island off to their right. So they bank right and crash into the island. The pilots die, but the man is left with only minor scrapes and bruises. As he wanders in a daze, he can’t comprehend much except for the fact he hears drums continuously playing. He stumbles off until he notices a mud hut with its owner outside. He goes up to him. 

Man: I’m sorry to bother you but why are their drums playing?

Owner: They always play. Never stop. 

Man: Well why don’t they ever stop?

Owner: If drums stop, bad things happen. Very bad things. If you want to know story, go to Keeper of Wisdom. He tell all. 

The man decides he’s going to search for the Keeper of Wisdom and ask him what happens, and as he’s walking he notices a woman carrying a basket walking on the side of the trail.

Man: Surely you know why there are drums playing.

The woman’s eyes widen

Woman: Yes. Drums. Never stop. Bad things happen when drums stop.

Man: Yes I know bad things happen, but what are the bad things that happen?

Woman: If must know. Go up hill to North. Keeper of Wisdom is there. He tell you. 

Man: O...kay... thanks.

The man is baffled yet decides to go on a trek to the top of the mountain to the north, finding his direction purely by how the sun was setting and how the North Star was placed in the sky. He climbs up all night, with only his bare hands and only eating snacks he salvaged from the plane and water from a running stream. All of this is going on, and in the background the drums are playing. They never stop. Once day breaks, he sees he’s close to the top of the mountain. He uses his last night of energy and gets to the top of the hill, where he sees a very old and fragile man meditating on a stone. He knows right away this is the Keeper of Wisdom. 

Man: Umm... e-excuse me, sir?

The Keeper of Wisdom looks up from his meditation and gives out a deep yet soothing, “yes?”

Man: I’ve just come from an overnight journey to see you, I must ask you a question. 

Keeper: Oh? Well then. You may ask question. 

Man: I crashed here yesterday and ever since I’ve gotten here there’s been drums that never stop. Why don’t they ever stop?

Keeper: Bad things happen. Very bad things. 

Man: Like what, sir?

The keeper has a scared look on his face as he looks deeply at the man. He then replies:

“Bassoon solo.”",Drums. Never. Stop,9
