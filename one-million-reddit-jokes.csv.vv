A long long time ago

I can still remember how Reddit used to make me smile,
And I knew if I had my chance,
That I could make those people dance,
And maybe they'd be happy for a while. 

But July came and made me shiver,
With every post I'd deliver,
Bad news on the front page,
I couldn't take one more nerd rage.


I can't remember if I cried,
When I read that Victoria ""died"",
But something touched me deep inside,
The day the subreddits died.


So bye bye miss IAMA gal,
Made the celebs get in touch with the regular guys,
And them good ol boys were raining gold from the skies,
Singin' this'll be the best AMA of my life,
This'll be the best AMA of my life.",Not much of a joke but a parody of American Pie for the events happening today,4

post,3bwtc3,2qh72,jokes,false,1435868222,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3bwtc3/god_will_save_me/,self.jokes,,"A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, “I will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.”

The neighbors came by his house and said to him, “We’re leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us!” But the man declined. “I have faith that God will save me.”

As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, “Hurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly!” But the man again said, “No thanks, God will save me.”

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. “We will come up and rescue you!” they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, “Use your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!”

The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.

A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, ""Grab my hand and I will pull you up!"" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. “No thank you! God will save me!”

Shortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.

When in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, “I put all of my faith in You. Why didn’t You come and save me?”

And God said, “Son, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter. What more were you looking for?”

She discovered that Congressman Harry Reid's great-great uncle, Remus Reid, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in   Montana  in 1889. Both Judy and Harry Reid share this common ancestor.
 
 The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows  in   Montana  territory

On the back of the picture Judy obtained during her research is this inscription: 'Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.' 
 
 So Judy recently e-mailed Congressman Harry Reid for information about their great-great uncle. 
 Harry Reid:

  Believe it or not, Harry Reid's staff sent back the following biographical sketch for her genealogy research:
 
 ""Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory . His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.""

The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse- sized tazer. The effects of the tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety?? 

WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home.. I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs. 

AWESOME!!! 

Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave. 

Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-A batteries, right? There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong? 

So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and tazer in another. The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries. 

All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and (loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-A batteries) thinking to myself, 'no possible way!' What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best! 

I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, 'don't do it dipshit,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and . . 

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD . . WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION . . . WHAT THE HELL!!! 

I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs? The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room. 

Note: If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a tazer, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor.. A three second burst would be considered conservative? 

IT HURT LIKE HELL!!! 

A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace. The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was. My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I had no control over the drooling. 

Apparently I pooped on myself, but was too numb to know for sure and my sense of smell was gone. I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair. I'm still looking for my nuts and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return! 

P.S. My wife, can't stop laughing about my experience, loved the gift, and now regularly threatens me with it!

At this point i'm shitting bricks.. who the hell did i pick up, is he gonna kill me? so i kept driving.. but as i kept going I decide, no way i'm gonna let some guy talk to me like that when i offer them a ride. so i pull over and i tell him the get the fuck out of my car. he looked at me then got out with his dogs and i sped off.

As he's ordering a beer, he happens to glance down towards the other end of the bar and see a man with a big orange head. As the bartender brings his beer, the man asks him, ""What's with the guy with the big orange head?""

The bartender chuckles. ""Yeah,"" he says, ""That's a helluva story, alright. Why don't you go buy him a drink, and maybe he'll tell you about it.""

So the man walks over to the guy with the orange head, introduces himself, and offers to buy him a beer. The guy with the orange head says, ""Let me guess. You want to hear about the head?""

The first guy says, ""Well, yeah. If you don't mind.""

The man with the orange head says, ""Alright. Lord knows I've run it over in my mind a million times, anyway. So, it's like this: One day, I was walking along a beach, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there, sticking out of the sand, was an antique lamp. So I picked it up and brushed away some of the sand, when a big cloud of blue smoke erupted from it. When the smoke cleared, a genie was standing there. And this genie said to me, 'Thank you for freeing me from my 5,000-year confinement. For doing this, I will grant you two wishes.'

""So, I think, wow, okay. And I do what many people would. For my first wish, I wish to be fantastically wealthy. So the genie snaps his fingers, and suddenly I'm covered in jewels. Hundreds of necklaces, three rings per finger, a crown on my head, and a chest full of gold next to me besides all that.""

At this point in the story, the first man is in amazement. He just can't believe what he's hearing. Eager to hear the rest, he says, ""So what was your second wish?""

The man with the orange head slowly takes a sip of his beer. He puts it down, and says, ""You know. This may be where I went wrong... I wished for a big orange head.""",The Big Orange Head Joke,4

   Penguins 
 
Did  you ever wonder why there are no dead penguins  on the ice  in   
 Antarctica    -  where do they go ? 
                                      
Wonder no more ! !  ! 

It  is a known fact that the penguin is a very  ritualistic bird which lives  an 
extremely  ordered and complex  life. 

The  penguin is very committed to its family and will  mate for life,   as well 
as  maintaining a form of compassionate contact with  its offspring 
throughout  its life. 

If  a penguin is found dead on the ice surface,  other members of  the  family 
and  social circle have been known to dig holes in   the ice, using their 
vestigial  wings and beaks, until the hole is deep enough  for the dead bird 
to  be rolled into and  buried. 

The  male penguins then gather in a circle around the  fresh grave and sing: 


 
  

          ""Freeze a jolly good fellow""
 
          ""Freeze a jolly good  fellow."" 


      ""Then  they kick him in the ice  hole.""

Harry answered, 'I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!' 

Ms.. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. 

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. 

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. 


Principal: 
'What is 3 x 3?'

Harry: 
'9.' 


Principal: 
'What is 6 x 6?' 


Harry: 
'36.'

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions..'

Ms. Brooks: 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?'

All three of them border a lake. Within the center of this lake is a grand, bountiful island, and the kingdoms have fought over the rights to the island for decades. They decide now to settle the score. They each send out knights and squires to duke it out and see who might lay claim to the island.

The first kingdom is very wealthy, and can send out 20 knights and 3 squires. On the first night, the first kingdom celebrated what they thought to be their impending victory - they polished armor, sharpened weapons, ate, and drank in great volumes, even jousting while inebriated.

The second kingdom was not so rich and fortunate as the first one, and could send only 10 knights and 2 squires. On that night, they polished armor, prepared and ate food, and sharpened their swords, but out of nervousness they did not celebrate - only drink. 

The third kingdom was very poor, and could only send out 1 elderly knight and his squire. The squire noosed a rope and used it to hang a pot over a fire to boil broth. The knight sharpened his own sword and polished his own armor, and slept.

On the day of the battle, the first kingdom's knights were half mortally wounded, and half so drunk they couldn't stand. The second kingdom's knights were *all* so drunk they couldn't stand. The third kingdom's lone knight was left- Oh, wait, no, he's asleep. He was so old that he slept too deeply to be woken by others.

Thus, they hold the fight between the squires. They don their knights' armories, and head forth to battle. Come the end, you could see only dust and rubble - as the cloud faded, standing in the fallen stumps of trees and the bodies of his enemies, the squire of the third kingdom stood.

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates: 

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!


So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

 

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs 


She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: 


Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.


'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.' 

 

So she continues upward . The third floor sign reads:


Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 

 

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

 

She goes to the fourth f loor and the sign reads: 


Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

 

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' 


Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

 

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. 

 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE: 

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.


The first floor has wives that love sex.


T he second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.


The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

In an effort to keep you informed, here are the definitions:

GUTS - Is arriving home late after a night out with the guys, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the Guts to ask: 'Are you still cleaning,  or are you flying somewhere?'

BALLS - Is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of perfume and beer,
lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the ass and having the Balls to say: 'You're next, Chubby.'

The man drops his pants and sure enough the doctor easily locates the rings. A red one, a purple one, and a brown one.

Wanting to run some quick tests, the doctor scrapes a little of the coloring from each ring into a vial. These are handed off to a nurse who rushes them to be tested.

“The results will only take a few minutes” says the doctor as he exits the exam room, “I will come back in as soon as they are ready.”

After nervously waiting for 15 minutes the doctor reenters the room.

“Well sir, I’ve got good news and bad news.  Which would you like to hear first?”

“Give the good, then the bad” the man replies as the sweat begins to bead on his forehead.

“The good news is that there is absolutely no health risk whatsoever! Both the red and purple rings are chemical matches to lipstick.""

Anyways, she'd never actually seen a ""seagull"" before so she was really having trouble. In fact, because her English wasn't so great she barely knew what the term ""seagull"" meant, though she understood ""go shoot"" just fine. So she packed her guns and flew to America, where she figured she'd find a seagull one day or another.

Well, she spends a good few weeks in America getting settled, seeing the sights, things like that. One day she ends up on the beach, just because you know, people go to the beach. She spends a great day on the beach, swimming, tanning, playing some volleyball with strangers, etc. After the sun sets, she's packing up and having some trouble with her umbrella. A man walks up to her and likes what he sees, starts talking her up, helping her out.

The two really hit it off well, even with the language barrier, and it's clear there's some mutual chemistry going on. Finally, the man asks her: ""So what brings you to the States?""

""Eet eez for 'unting seagulls,"" she replies in her thick French accent. ""But I 'ave not found any.""

""Well, bad luck with that!"" says the man. ""There were seagulls all over the beach earlier today but they're all gone now.""

""Oh,"" murmurs the French woman, crestfallen. ""Zat eez unfortunate. I can't belief I 'ad such an opportunity and meessed eet.""

""Yeah well, easy come easy go, right?"" the man laughs. The woman isn't familiar with this English turn of phrase but laughs with him anyways.

""Say uh,"" the man begins again, looking around furtively. ""Sorry if this sounds forward but do you want to, maybe, go get some dinner or something?""

The woman gives him a coy grin. ""I would love to,"" she says.

So the two go and have a great night out on the town. The man treats her to a surf and turf over wine, and later they hit the clubs and dance until past midnight. One thing sort of leads to another as they tend to do at clubs and it ends up back in the man's hotel room with the French woman and one of the man's friends, all drunk.

Sorry. This isn't part of the story; I'm just apologizing in advance.

Anyway, the three of them eschew the foreplay and start going at it. I'll spare the details here but it would've been clear to anyone watching that the French chick really knew what she was doing and knew how to work two guys. The first man doesn't last more than half an hour before he's out, but the man's friend keeps going on and on for hours. Finally, he can't hold it in anymore and just explodes everywhere, all over her face, her chest, and her legs.

""Wow,"" she purrs. ""Do you see zat?""

""Oh yeah I do,"" the man's friend says with a grin. He leans back and admires his handiwork as the woman abruptly reaches into her bag, pulls a pistol, and shoots him twice in the chest and once in the head.

""Oh my god!"" screams the other man. ""What the fuck did you do that for!?""

The woman looks back at him in confusion. ""I am 'unting seagulls, you know zees, oui?"" 

The man sputters in disbelief. ""Wh-you can't possibly have thought that he was a seagull!""

""But eet eez as you said - 'e see cum, 'e seagull!""","A French woman was challenged by an English friend to ""go shoot a seagull."" [mildly NSFW]",0

She brought home a baker, a farmer, a lord, even a few knights, but no matter their social standing, wealth, or intelligence, her father would not approve. Exasperated with trying and failing to find a prince, the princess said to her father, ""If no man I can bring home will satisfy you, then find a man for me!"" The king was delighted! This was all he had ever wanted. And so, the king issued a royal decree: 

""To all eligible bachelors of the realm: I invite you to the castle on the first day of the next month in a challenge to fight for my daughter, the princess. The champion shall be granted the opportunity to court her, and if she so decides, marry her.""

Lo and behold, at the first of the month, thousands of men were lined up at the castle gates. The king invites the men into his gymnasium, where they see the largest swimming pool they have ever witnessed. The king instructs the men to line up on the edge of the pool. ""Men, the first of you to cross this vast pool and climb out on my side shall be the champion and will be allowed to court my daughter."" Instantly, all the men inch closer to the edge, ready to dive in and swim faster than they ever have before. ""But wait,"" says the king, motioning to his servants. The servants then dump hundreds of sharks, piranhas, snapping turtles, and jelly fish into the pool. As if on cue, every single man takes two steps back. No man would ever dare brave these waters, which is exactly the king's intentions. No man is good enough for his daughter. A smug grin begins to spread across the king's face, when a loud splash breaks the silence. Everyone in the room gasps immediately as a single man swims frantically across the pool. The king had never seen anyone move with such speed! 

When the man finally crosses to the king's side of the pool, he climbs out, bloody and with large bite marks covering his body. The king is struck with disbelief, ""My boy, what you have just done is the bravest thing I have ever seen. Not only will I allow you to court my daughter, but I will grant you one wish, so long as it is within my power.""
Bent over from exhaustion, the man pants, ""Thank you, your majesty. I know what I would like.""
""Are you sure? You've just had a very traumatic experience! You should rest for a few days, think about it, and then come back to me and I will make it so.""
The man insists, ""No, sir, I know exactly what I want.""

Nick responds, ""No, of course I don't."" To that, Geoff says, ""I'm Geoff, everyone knows me."" He then turns to address the rest of the people in the building, and asks, ""Everyone! Do you know who I am?"" To this, the whole bar responds, ""Geoff! Yay, Geoff!""

Nick, rather surprised, but not overtly so, says, ""Sure, they know you in this bar, but I bet they don't know you in a bar across town.""

So, they drive 10 minutes across the town to another bar. Geoff asks, ""Hey everyone! Do you know who I am?"" To this, the whole bar responds, ""Geoff! Yay, Geoff!""

Now slightly shaken, Nick says, ""I bet the mayor doesn't know you."" In response to this, Geoff drives him down to the mayor's office. The mayor comes out, warmly greeting Geoff - ""Oh, Geoff, how have you been?"" The mayor then gestured them into his office. After a personal talk that lasted a couple hours, all of them left, but Nick wasn't done yet - ""I bet the Governor doesn't know you.""

Thus, they drive a couple of hours to the governor's mansion. A man greets them at the door, immediately recognizing Geoff - ""Ah, Geoff, right this way. The governor was just asking about you."" They walked in, and then walked into his office, and had a long talk before leaving.

""I bet the President doesn't know you,"" Nick continued. Thus, they drove several hours down to visit the White House. They were ushered in by the guards, who all immediately recognized Geoff, and met with the President.

""Okay, so you know the mayor, the governor, and the President of the United States of America. However, I bet you don't know the Pope.""

Thus, their journey continues as they take a plane to Rome and pay a visit to St. Peter's Basilica, and Geoff said, ""Wait here. Not everyone can have an audience with the Pope, so I will walk with him out onto the balcony."" Thus, Geoff goes in, and Nick waits as he is told.

A few minutes later, Geoff, who had been talking with the pope, steps out onto the balcony and witnesses Nick fainting. He rushes downstairs, and to his relief, Nick woke up on short order. Geoff asks, ""What happened?""

So in my calculus class last year in math, there were these two Chinese twins. Ving, and Ling. Ving was always super cool with me. In exchange for answers (he was super smart) I would hang out with him and be his friend and stuff. After I cheated off of him and studied with him though, I did get to be his friend and we got very close. His sister, Ling, was always uptight about school and she made sure to study, she got stressed about a B, etc. One day I was hanging out with Ving, and we started talking about names. He went off on this huge rant about how he hated his, and how he wanted to change it to something more Asian-American, like Lee. I told him that the Courthouse downtown had a form that you could fill to legally change it. He told me:


""I always give you answers. If you could just drive me down to the courthouse this one time, I will never forget you. I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever."" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving's name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn't care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.

When we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn't change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn't do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.

It was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.

When Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said

""Dad, I love my name. I want to be Ving forever, and I'm going to name my kids Ving, and they're going to name their kids Ving, and-""

And the old man said ""Dont, stop. Be Lee, Ving! Hold onto that fee, Ling.""

We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you the People. 

The nanny, we will consider her the Working Class. 

And your baby brother, we will call him the Future.

When they graduated, they wanted to both go to the same college but the girl was accepted to a college on the east coast, and the guy went to the west coast. 

They agreed to be faithful to each other and spend anytime they could together. As time went on, the guy would call the girl but she was never home and when he wrote, she would take weeks to return any letters. Even when he e-mailed her, she took days to return his messages. Finally, she confessed to him that she wanted to date around. He didn't take this very well and increased his calls and letters and e-mails trying to win back her love. Because she became annoyed, and now had a new boyfriend, she wanted to get him off her back. 

So what she did was this: 

She took a polaroid picture of her sucking her new boyfriend's unmentionables and sent it to her old boyfriend with a note reading, ""I found a new boyfriend, leave me alone."" Well needless to say, this guy was heartbroken, but even more so, he was pissed. 

So what he did next was awesome: 

He wrote on the back of the photo the following: ""Dear Mom and Dad, having a great time at college, please send more money!"" and then mailed the picture to her parents.",Two Sweethearts,9

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""


Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""


The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Macbook Air, tethers it to his Galaxy S3 and uses its built-in GPS function to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to a NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.
The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...
Within seconds, he receives an email on his Android that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Macbook Air, after a few minutes, receives a response.
Finally, he simply opens the spreadsheet on his laptop, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked.

Steel was known for holding up large transportation shuttles and demanding ransom. It was no surprise that after years of dodging the Intergalactic Police Force, Steel managed to develop a hefty amount of money.

On July 4, 3055, Steel revealed a massive construct the size of the Moon, on it was a weapon with great concentrated power that could destroy a planet. The weapon was pointed at the capital of the Milky Way galaxy -- Earth-6, a behemoth, terraformed Jupiter, the center of governance and knowledge in the galaxy.

Steel broadcasted to this massive planet, and demanded 300 trillion quarsecs or else the entire planet would be decimated. Helpless to do anything, the planet gave into Steel's demands and decided to give him all the money. Steel, being the scum that he was, fired his massive weapon anyways.

The massive weapon was a beam of pure concentrated plutonium, with a power to destroy the planet in 30 minutes.

The planet's military was in a panic, scrambling fighter ships and sending them in the hopes of destroying the weapon before it could do more damage. One fighter by the name of Jet had the idea of making the plutonium beam impact another object in space before reaching Earth-6. He thought of sending his fuel-cells in the line of the weapon, burning the plutonium in process and causing an explosion in space.

Jet shot up into space, with the plutonium mass approaching him at a high speed. Jet threw his fuel-cells at the plutonium, but it's far too much power for the cells to handle... Jet's fuel can't melt Steel's beam.",Maximilian Steel threatened to destroy the world...,2

Mick gets worried, so he turns to Andy and asks ""Did you bring the bottle opener?"" Naturally Andy didn't bring it, so they're stuck five miles from home without a bottle opener.


Mick and Andy beg Roy to go back for it but he refuses as he says they will eat all the sandwiches before he gets back.

10 days pass and Roy still hasn't returned. Andy and Mick, true to their word, don't touch the sandwiches. Another five days pass and Roy still isn't back. The two are really hungry now, but a promise is a promise and they leave the sandwiches untouched. 

Finally, after another few days, the two can't take it any longer. ""We have to eat them or else we're going to fucking starve,"" Mick says. Andy agrees and so they both take out a sandwich each. They're about to eat when all of a sudden Roy jumps out from behind a nearby rock and shouts:

Her loving fundamentalist Christian parents doted on her and homeschooled her all her childhood, but they were tragically killed when she was 18.  Now she had to go out on the Internet to find a potential husband, one who wrote he was born without a penis.

The good news was that she could not lose her virginity, so they could caress quite freely, and the randy lad naturally asked to see where her vagina would have been.  After much hesitation she finally lets him see.  He bursts out laughing.  ""That's not where a vagina goes... that's your belly button!""

He wants to look somewhere else, but she stops him, saying *that*'s a nasty, nasty wound that starts bleeding almost every month.  Her mom said to keep it bandaged all the time and never touch it or it might never stop bleeding at all.  He tells her it's a vagina, but she doesn't believe him, because her parents would never *lie* to her.

After days of sweet talk and researching on the Internet the beneficial substances present in saliva, he finally convinces her to let him gently lick the wound to make it better.  And by force of G-spot-fu, he brings her to wave after wave of ecstasy.

He asks his wife: ""My dear wife, please tell me whose son is this ?

-Dear husband, last winter, during a snowy day, as I was wandering, sad and crying because you were absent, I looked up in the sky in prayer for your safe return, and I accidentally ate a snowflake. And then, miraculously, the following year, I was blessed with this child !

-Truly, this must be a miracle ! The grace of God is upon our family ! I will raise this child as my own, as we are blessed by Him !""

When the boy reaches the age of 15, the merchant decides to take him with him for a business travel to teach him the job. The wife begs him to be careful, tells him she will pray for their success and well-being, and asks him to bring her son back home safe. The man travels to Genoa, where he meets a friend who takes him to Alexandria. There, he quickly sells the boy on the slave market, continues his business in the Middle-East, and heads back home. As he enters, his wife sees that he is alone, panics and asks him :

""Husband, where is my son ? what happened to him ?!

The parrot continues, so finally the man puts the bird in the freezer. About an hour later, the parrot asks the man to please open the door. As the man takes the shivering bird out of the freezer, it says, ""I promise to never swear again. Just tell me what that turkey did!""",The Parrot,2

Nightfall was rapidly approaching and he had nowhere to sleep. He went up to a farmhouse and asked the farmer if he could spend the night.

The farmer told him that he could sleep in the barn. As the story goes, the farmer's daughter asked her father, ""Who is that man going into the barn?""

""That fellow traveling through,"" said the farmer. ""Needs a place to stay for the night, so, I told him he could sleep in the barn.""

The daughter said, ""Perhaps he is hungry.""

So she prepared him a plate of food for him and then took it out to the barn About an hour later, the daughter returned. Her clothing disheveled and straw in her hair. Straight up to bed she went. The farmer's wife was very observant. She then suggested that perhaps the man was thirsty. So she fetched a bottle of wine, took it out to the barn. And she too did not return for an hour. Her clothing was askew, her blouse buttoned incorrectly. She also headed straight to bed.

The next morning at sunrise the man in the barn got up and continued on his journey, waving to the farmer as he left. When the daughter awoke and learned that the visitor was gone, she broke into tears.

""How could he leave without even saying goodbye,"" she cried. ""We made such passionate love last night!""

""What?"" shouted the father as he angrily ran out of the house looking for the man, who by now was halfway up the mountain.

The farmer screamed up at him, ""I'm going to get you! You had sex with my daughter!""

The man looked back down from the mountainside, cupped his hand next to his mouth, and yelled out....

his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill. He walks down the street to the
local brothel and knocks on the door. 
The madame opens the door and asks Jack what she can do for him.

'I'm really horny, but I only have $5. What can you do for me?' Jack asks
the madam.

She looks over this fellow and tells him, 'Don't worry. We can take care of you. No problem.'

She leads Jack into this room where in the opposite corner is a chicken.
Jack thinks about this a second and figures it can't be that bad. He gives
the madam the $5 and she closes the door behind her. Jack undresses and has the time of his life. When he's done he can't remember when he had ever had such a pleasurable experience.

One week later, and horny again, Jack has saved up $10. Being a satisfied customer he goes back to the same madame and asks what she can do for him for $10.

'Well, for $10 we have a special show,' the madame replies. She leads him into a different room where there are several other people sitting on benches. 'Sit back and enjoy the show, Jack,' she tells him.

Jack gives the money to the madame and takes a seat on one of the benches.

Soon after, the lights dim and the blinds open, revealing another room on the other side of a two-way mirror where two women begin to undress each other. Jack is very impressed. Clearly these women are unaware anyone is watching as they begin to make love to each other passionately. Apparently there is nothing they won't do to each other.

Jack once again feels like he is getting his money's worth. He turns to the person beside him and says, 'This is a pretty good show for ten bucks, eh?!'
