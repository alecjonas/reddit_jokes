post,8qycp7,2qh72,jokes,false,1528943941,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8qycp7/voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"A married couple is very happy in their life, but the husband took a new very lucrative job that is going to keep him away from home for weeks and possibly months at a time. He loves his wife and understands that she will have certain... needs while he's away, so he tells her, ""Take the credit card, and get yourself whatever 'toy' you wish. I dont care what it costs so long as it keeps you faithful to me, as I will be to you while I'm away.""

She went to a few adult shops around town, but did not find anything that she thought would fulfill her needs. She had all but lost hope when she wandered into an older, dingy looking shop. 

The proprietor asked,  ""May I help you find something?"" The lady begrudgingly explained her situation feeling oddly comfortable around the elderly owner, to which she replied, ""I have just the thing for you. Come in the back room.""

In the back room, she was greeted by a twin mattress and very dim lighting. The owner took out an old wooden box, and motioned her towards the bed.

""Take off your pants and underwear, and this toy will give you the show of your life.""

Trembling, she obliged and layed on the bed. Once she was in position, the old lady said, ""Voodoo duck, her pussy."" The box flung itself open and an old polished wooden penis flew itself out of the box and went haywire in the woman's lady bits, giving her multiple orgasms in a matter of minutes.

""OKAY! MAKE IT STOP!""

The old lady calmly stated, ""Voodoo dick, back in your box."" The sentient dildo ceased it's duty, returned to it's box and the lid closed itself.

""I dont care what this thing costs! I must have it! Here's my credit card. I'll take it!""

The young woman could hardly wait to get home and try it out again. She finally arrived home, got completely undressed, placed the old box on her dresser, and assumed the position.

""Voodoo dick, my pussy.""

The box flung itself open and the phallus went to work on her vertical smile. One, two... seven, eight orgasms later, she had enough, but could not remember how to get voodoo dick to stop. She grabbed the wooden box, hastily dressed herself and got in her car to head back to the shop. 

The orgasms continued, causing her to swerve all over the road. Sure enough. She saw blue and red flashing lights in her rearview mirror and pulled over cooperatively.

When the police officer approached her window, she stated before he could speak, ""I'm so sorry officer, it's just that... I can't stop the.... I have to.... it's voodoo dick.""

The officer smirked and said, ""Yeah, yeah. Voodoo dick my ass!""",Voodoo dick,11

The doctor eyed him and asked, “Do you smoke or drink immoderately?”

“Oh no doc, and I don’t touch drugs either,” he replied with a confident chuckle.

“How about your diet? Do you eat hamburgers, barbecue ribs, ribeye steaks, and plenty of dessert?”

The man replied, “No, my last doctor advised me to steer clear of all that!”

The doctor continued, “Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf, boating, sailing, hiking, or biking?”

“No, I don’t.”

“Do you gamble, drive fast, or have a lot of sex?”

“Certainly not,” the man assured the doctor.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with *geese*.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\-inch *pianist*?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve\-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve\-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve\-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve\-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat\-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\-inch *pianist*?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean *that*.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one\-foot\-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes...,10

He finally puts his book down and hands her a tissue. ""There, there, my child,"" he says. ""Here, calm down. Now, what exactly is the problem? Why are you crying?""

The girl takes the tissue and dries her eyes, but she's still whimpering. After a few more sobs and a few deep breaths, she finally replies:

Later in the evening, the sprinter approaches the diver to ask about her.

""I just can't get her out of my head!"" the sprinter says. ""I have to sleep with her! Who is she?""

The diver, obviously hesitant, considers this. ""Listen,"" he says, ""I know a thing or two about that woman, but I'm not going to just tell you. Maybe if you could get me some alcohol, then we could talk.""

Well, alcohol being forbidden in the Olympic Village, the sprinter knows that the request is a steep one... but as luck has it, he actually has a secret supply of liquor hidden in his room. He retrieves it, returns, then plies the diver with drink until the man is ready to talk.

""Okay, listen,"" the diver says, slightly slurring his words. ""That woman? She'll sleep with anyone who claims to be a gold medalist. Just keep the lights off when you go into her room, and she'll never know the difference.""

The sprinter is ecstatic to hear this. He waits for the party to wind down, then sneaks over to the woman's room and knocks on the door. It opens a crack, and – keeping his face turned away – the sprinter says, ""Hi, I'm a gold medalist.""

In a sudden whirlwind of motion, the sprinter finds himself being pulled into the room. What follows is the most mind-blowing sex of his life, after which he is left feeling tired, satisfied... and a little bit guilty. While lying there in the darkness, he turns to his partner.

""Listen,"" he says, ""I'm really sorry about this, but I'm not actually a gold medalist.""

""That's okay,"" comes a voice. ""I'm the buzzed diver!""",There's a party in the Olympic Village one night...,93

""-Uncle""  
   
All the family is speechless. They proceed to cheer little Timmy and ask him to say something else, but little Timmy remains silent again.   
   
The next morning, uncle Tom is found dead in his house.  
   
Fast forward, on next Christmas, the Thompsons are hosting another huge family dinner, and suddenly little Timmy stands up again:

Family cheers, all of them except Grandpa Elliot who remembers last years dinner, after his grandson words doomed uncle Tom. Everyone makes fun of it and expect little Timmy to speak up again, but nothing more comes out his lips.  
   
That very same night, grandpa Elliot suffers a seizure and dies.  
   
Fast forward another year, and the Thompsons are hosting yet another not-so-huge-this-time Christmas dinner.

Almost at the end of the dinner, when everyone thinks they are safe, little Timmy stands up again:  
   
""-Dad""  
   
The Thompsons are devastated. Mr Adam Thompson, with a tear in his eye, proceeds to call the emergency notary, and places everything in order. He then hugs his family one last time, opens up the bottle of bourbon he kept for special occasions and drinks all of it, falling asleep.  
   
The next morning, Mr Adam Thompson wakes up in what seems to be not his house. Warm morning sun is bathing his tired face. Everything is silent. Still sleepy and suffering the effects of the hangover, he stands up and stumbles upon some person dressed in white robes.
  
""-Am I in Heaven?"", he asks. ""Are you an angel?""  
   
""No sir, I am your doctor. You were lucky, you suffered a severe alcohol intoxication, but you will be okay.""  
   
Feeling happy to have cheated death, Mr Adam recovers and goes back home in a couple hours. While returning to his home, his neighbour greets him:

At the first eskimo's igloo, he takes them inside and says, ""I will show you just how cold my igloo is."" He licks his fingertip, then touches it to the metal doorknob of the coat closet. It freezes quickly, and he begins opening and closing the door with just one finger. ""You see?"" he says. ""That's the coldest igloo in the world!""

Wanting to impress him due to his high level of knowledge in typography, she spent hours on her classwork.  She soon found herself at the top of the class, consistently earning the highest marks on work and tests, even drawing some brief words of praise on a couple of occasions - something not heard of from an instructor who was normally so difficult to please.

For the year-end project in the class, a culmination of everything the students had been taught that year, she decided to pull out all the stops.  She selected one of her favorite essays and placed the text into a special font of her own personal design, with each serif, stem, apex, vertex, and ball terminal carefully crafted to stand out startlingly in its uniqueness, yet still be smooth and pleasant to the reader's eye.  She hand-tooled the metal type blocks of each letter in order to perfect the kerning.  Hours' upon hours' work she dedicated to the project, even going so far as to use a precision micrometer gauge to place the text's indentations.  

On the day the class grades were to be announced, the instructor notified the student that he wished to see her in his office to discuss her final grade.  The student was over the moon.  Her mind raced, wondering what kind of praise would be heaped on her.  She envisioned the dean of the school personally congratulating her, her work published in the leading typography journals, possibly even an offer to become an instructor herself.

However, when she arrived, she saw her instructor was stone-faced.  

""I will allow you to pass this class,"" said the instructor, an icy bite in his voice, ""but you will receive no credit for your final project.""

Stunned, the student was speechless.  She couldn't believe what she was hearing!  ""Is this a mistake?"" she asked, finally finding her voice.

""I had such high hopes, your performance throughout the year was stellar.  I was prepared to declare you the greatest mind in typography the world had ever seen!""  The instructor seemed genuinely upset; out of place for a man normally so somber and even-tempered.

Overcome, the student felt tears welling up.  ""What did I do wrong?  I spent days on this project!  I tried so hard to make it perfect, the text, the kerning, everything!  Even the indents were precisely measured, calibrated to be the perfect spacing!""

""That is precisely the problem,"" said the instructor, gravely.  ""The road to hell is paved with good indentions.""",A typography student is preparing her final project,2

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money – fifty thousand dollars!

Jerry said, We’ve got to give it back.

Sally said, Finders keepers. She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.

The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?

Sally said, No.
Jerry said, She¹s lying. She hid it up in the attic.

Sally said, Don’t believe him, he¹s getting senile

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.
The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.
While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.
Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.
The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.
Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.
""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""","So, a man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there.",3

His wife was a  dog called Red.

They lived happily in a home with three servants, one and a half for each. Just the way they liked it.

They took the servants out to do everything, such as go to the park and get them to fetch things for them - it was such a fun game and they loved to play it.

One day, one of the servants left. It was one of the males. The youngest. He didn't return, often, he came back once in a while when there was a lot of family around. 

Five years after the youngest servant left Otto, his eldest male left for good aswell. We don't know where he went but he hasn't been seen since. 

Otto then lost his wife, Red. It turns out that Red wasn't another dog at all - but a bed. 

He found out soon after he was took to the doctor and given some strange pills - they were inserted in his rectum.

The fact that Otto found out Red was a Bed was horrific. This led him to an alcohol addiction, stealing alcohol from the liquor cabinet in the basement. 

He only has one servant left - and he doesn't like her very much - hates her in fact.

He decides to leave his mansion - without a servant. The first time in many a year.

As he leaves he crosses the road and gets hit by a truck.

This is the joke of Otto's life.

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example…One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either",No Sex Tonight!,450

On his first day, he takes off his clothes and starts wandering around. A gorgeous petite blonde walks by him and Dave immediately gets an erection.

Dave replies, “No, what do you mean?”

She says, “You must be new here; let me explain. It’s a rule here that if I give you an erection, it implies you called for me.” Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lies down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.

Dave is very happy and continues exploring the facilities.

Dave replies, “No, what do you mean?”

The huge man says, “You must be new here; it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me.” The huge man then easily spins Dave around, bends him over the bench and has his way with him.

Dave rushes back to the colony office. He is greeted by the smiling, naked, receptionist. “May I help you sir?”

Dave says, “Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 membership fee.”

The shocked receptionist says, “But, sir, you’ve only been here a couple of hours. You have only seen a small fraction of our facilities.”

No one, however wanted the responsibility… until the synagogue janitor, Moishe, volunteered.

As there was nobody else who wanted to go, Moishe was given the task. But because he knew only Hebrew, a silent debate was agreed. The day of the debate came, and they went to St. Peter’s Square to sort out the decision. First the Pope waved his hand around his head. Moishe pointed firmly at the ground.

The Pope, in some surprise, held up three fingers. In response, Moishe gave him the middle finger.  
The crowd started to complain, but the Pope thoughtfully waved them to be quiet. He took out a bottle of wine and a wafer, holding them up. Moishe took out an apple, and held it up.

The Pope, to the people’s surprise, said, “I concede. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.”  
Later, the Pope was asked what the debate had meant. He explained, “First, I showed him the Heavens, to show that God is everywhere. He pointed at the ground to signify that God is right here with us. I showed him three fingers, for the Trinity. He reminded me that there is One God common to both our religions. I showed him wine and a wafer, for God’s forgiveness. With an apple, he showed me original sin. The man was a master of silent debate.”

In the Jewish corner, Moishe had the same question put to him, and answered, “It was all nonsense, really. First, he told me that this whole town would be free of Jews. I told him, Go to Hell! We’re staying right here! Then, he told me we had three days to get out. I told him just what I thought of that proposal.” An older woman asked, “But what about the part at the end?” “That?” said Moishe with a shrug, “Well, I saw him take out his lunch, so I took out mine.”","One Pope, in the Dark Ages, decreed that all Jews had to leave Rome...",977

He decided that it would better for them to indulge in the taste and then learn to stave of the temptation of later consumption, so that the monks will-fully strive to be like Adam rather than doing so out of simply not knowing what it is like.

So on a sunny Thursday eve, the monks finish their prayers for the day and gather in the garden. In the garden, the head abbot gives the jobs of frying the meat to two monks; Brother Lucas and Friar Gabriel.

As the barbecue starts, the monks all take food from each server at a fairly similar rate. As the evening progresses however, Brother Lucas starts to get less and less monks asking him for food.

It gets to the point where he is alone on one side of the garden whilst everyone else is crowded around Friar Gabriel on the other. 

Feeling annoyed, he goes to the Abbot.

""Father, I do not understand. Why is it that they flock to him and not I?"" Brother Lucas asks.

""Well my child it's rather simple,"" the Abbot says.

Here in Sweden, there's a classic joke cycle called ""All the children-jokes"". They're kind of like limericks, but less strict. All jokes follow this pattern in some way:
""All the children do x, except [name] because he/she does y.""
Where y rhymes with the name. You can experiment with tense and phrasing as you like. The point is to make y as unexpected and comical in relation to x as possible. Of course, there is also the game of making these jokes as dirty and morbid as possible.
Some examples:
All the children were planned, except Jake.
His parents made a mistake.

All the children were tired, except Jane.
She had cocaine.

All the children stared into the microwave, except Jack.
He stared back.

All the children were swimming, except Joe.
His lungs were full of H2O.

All the children are loved by their parents, except Dale.
He is for sale.

All the children died in the school shooting, except Tim.
They'll regret not respecting him.

All the children were cannibals, except Lucy.
She was juicy. 

All the children killed a terrorist, except Belle.
She killed an infidel.

All the children crossed the road, except Neil.
He was hit by an Oldsmobile.

All the children can handle explosives, except Grace.
She is all over the place.

Keep them coming...","Reintroducing ""All the children"" jokes",107

Though the poor lady was not very proficient in English, she did manage to communicate with her husband with gestures mostly. The real problem arose whenever she had to go grocery shopping.

One day, she went to the butcher and wanted to buy chicken legs. She didn’t know how to put forward her request.  So in desperation, she clucked like a chicken and lifted up her skirt to show her thighs. The butcher got the message, and gave her the chicken legs.

The next day, she needed to get chicken breasts. Again, she didn’t know how to tell the butcher.  So she clucked like a chicken and unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breasts.  The butcher understood again, and gave her some chicken breasts.

The third day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages. Unable to find a way to communicate this, she brought her husband to the store . . .

A guy comes up to him in the bar one day and says, ""Are you the guy who charges $10,000 a bullet?""

""Yup.""

""What if you miss?""

He looks at the man, deadly serious. ""I don't miss...""

""Okay, we'll I've got $20,000. I just found out my wife is having an affair with my best friend. They're at the motel together right now.""

""Let's go,"" the assassin says.

""They're in room 21. I want you to shoot her in the head, and I want you to blow his dick off.""

The assassin looks through his scope. He keeps staring for several minutes, not taking the shot.

""Well? What are you waiting for!?"" the husband asks.

""Hold on a minute. I think I can save you $10,000.""
