They arrive at the club and the doorman says, ""Hey, Dave! How ya doin'?""

His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before.  
""Oh, no,"" says Dave. ""He's on my bowling team.""

When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if he'd like his usual and brings over a Budweiser.

His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,""How did she know that you drink Budweiser?""

""She's in the Ladies' Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.""

A  stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave,  and says ""Hi Davey. Want your usual lap dance, big boy?""

Dave's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.

Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. He tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having  none of it. She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every name in the book.

The cabby turns his head and says, ""Looks like you picked up a real bitch tonight, Dave""",Dave's Birthday,17

He was cruising along the beach in the pope-mobile when he heard a frantic commotion just off shore. A helpless man wearing a Green Bay Packer jersey was struggling frantically to free himself from the jaws of a 25-foot shark. 

As the Pope watched, horrified, a speedboat came racing up with three men wearing Minnesota Viking jerseys. One quickly fired a harpoon into the shark's side. The other two reached out and pulled the bleeding, semi-conscious Packer Backer from the water, Then, using long clubs, the three beat the shark to death and hauled it into the boat. 

Immediately the Pope shouted and summoned them to the beach. ""I give you my blessing for your brave actions,"" he told them. ""I heard that there was bitter hatred between Green Bay Packers &amp; Vikings fans, but now I have seen with my own eyes that this is not true."" As the Pope drove off, the harpooner asked his buddies ""Who the heck was that??"" 

""It was the most knowledgeable Pope,"" one replied. ""He can summon God anytime and has access to all of God's wisdom."" 

""Well,"" the harpooner said, ""he may be knowledgeable &amp; have access to God's wisdom, but he knows squat about shark fishing. Is the bait holding up okay, or do we need to get another one?"" ","The Pope, the Packers &amp; the Vikings",49

""Anything?"" he asked in excitement.

""Anything.""

Johnny sat there for several minutes contemplating what he wanted for his birthday breakfast. He finally sprung up and told her what he wanted for breakfast. 

Once he told her, the mother's face grew very red with anger and she shouted, ""HOW DARE YOU! GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW!""

So Johnny, confused and upset, ran up to his room and cried himself to sleep.

The next morning, Johnny got up and got ready for school. His parents were nowhere in sight, so he didn't have breakfast at home. He decided to stop at a mini mart on the way to school to get something to eat, because you know what they say, ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!"" This caused him to be late for school.

When he walked into class, the teacher asked him why he was late for school. Johnny replied with, ""Well last night my mom told me that I could have whatever I wanted for my birthday breakfast, and when I told her what I wanted, she got really mad and sent me to my room. When I got up this morning, my parents were gone, so I couldn't get breakfast. So I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat because you know what they say, 'Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!' That caused me to run behind... and here I am.""

The teacher looked very puzzled and asked, ""Well what could you have possibly asked for that resulted in all this?"" Johnny told her what he asked for. The entire class burst into laughter, and just like with his mother, his teacher grew red in the face and very angry and shouted, ""GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE NOW! I WILL NOT TOLERATE THAT BEHAVIOR IN MY CLASSROOM!""

Johnny, very confused, made his way into the principal's office and plopped down in the seat in front of a big desk. The principal, very perplexed, asked, ""Now Johnny, what are you doing here? You're one of the best students in the school!"" Johnny said in response... ""Well last night my mom told me that I could have whatever I wanted for my birthday breakfast, and when I told her what I wanted, she got really mad and sent me to my room. When I got up this morning, my parents were gone, so I couldn't get breakfast. So I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat because you know what they say, 'Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!' That caused me to run behind and be late for class. When the teacher asked me why I was late, I told her the story and she got really mad... and here I am.""

""Well what did you ask for that got you into this mess?""

""I don't think I should say. Every time I say it, I get in trouble.""

""Nonsense!"" The principal chuckled, ""This is a safe space, you can tell me anything.""

Johnny reluctantly said what he asked for, and the principal was fuming. ""THIS KIND OF CHILDISHNESS IS UNACCEPTABLE! YOU'RE EXPELLED!""

Johnny went home, crying the whole way there. Once he got home, his dad was there. He said ""What are you doing home from school so early? It's only 11!"" Johnny said in response... ""Well last night my mom told me that I could have whatever I wanted for my birthday breakfast, and when I told her what I wanted, she got really mad and sent me to my room. When I got up this morning, my parents were gone, so I couldn't get breakfast. So I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat because you know what they say, 'Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!' That caused me to run behind and be late for class. When the teacher asked me why I was late, I told her the story and she got really mad and sent me to the principal's office. When the principal asked why I was in his office, I told him the story and he expelled me... and here I am.""

""Well what did you ask your mother for that got you in so much trouble?""

""I don't think I should say. Every time I say it, I get into more trouble.""

The father sternly replied, ""I am your father. When I ask you a question, you give me the answer. Understood?""

""Okay..."" Johnny says. He proceeds to tell his father what he wanted, to which he became furious and said, ""NO SON OF MINE WILL EVER TALK LIKE THAT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SON! PACK YOUR BELONGINGS AND GET OUT!""

(section omitted because this joke is getting out of hand)

Many years later, we find Johnny lost on the streets. He sits next to an old homeless man who looked kind. The old man asked, ""How did you get here? You look so young and full of potential.""

Johnny sighs. ""This all started years ago, my mom told me that I could have whatever I wanted for my birthday breakfast, and when I told her what I wanted, she got really mad and sent me to my room. When I got up this morning, my parents were gone, so I couldn't get breakfast. So I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat because you know what they say, 'Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!' That caused me to run behind and be late for class. When the teacher asked me why I was late, I told her the story and she got really mad and sent me to the principal's office. When the principal asked why I was in his office, I told him the story and he expelled me. When I went home and told my dad what happened, he kicked me out of the house... and now here I am, with nothing left in my life.""

""Well what on earth did you ask for that caused you to lose everything?

""Oh no no no, I'm not telling anyone that! Every time I answer that question, something bad happens.""

""Why not tell me? What else do you have to lose?""

""You're right... what do I have to lose?

""Soooooo what was it?""

Johnny sighs again and says, ""A cherry pie.""

The old man just laughs. Johnny looks very confused. He looks up and says, ""Well if you want a cherry pie so bad, go get one from that stand across the street! Here, have a little bit of my cash, if you promise you'll share with me.""

""You're right, I should get that pie!""

So Johnny gets up, crosses the street, and gets hit by a bus.

What's the moral of this story, you ask?

...

Look both ways before you cross the street. ",It was just a day until Johnny turned 10,32

You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. 

I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
 
Trump thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.
 
In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. Ted kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.
 
""No,"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer, and I don't think I could do that all day long.""
 
The devil led him to the door of the next room.
 
In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing the hammer, time after time after time.
 
""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,""
 
The devil opened a third door. Through it, Trump saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Trump looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""
 
The devil smiled and said ...  ""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""

""Don Trivioli shoves this brush up his ass!""

Outraged he finishes up and storms back into the bar, populated by a number of rival gangs, all sat in their groups.

""WHO HAS DISGRACED ME IN SUCH A WAY. KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT OVER."" Don Trivioli bellows.

Then, knowing he has just made an ungraceful disturbance, he hands a fifty to one of his goons and says, making eye contact with the bar man.

""Go take the toilet brush from in there, take it out, and burn it. Then I want you to go to the nearest hardware store and buy the nicest, most expensive toilet brush you can.""

The goon scuttles to his duty.

Don Trivioli takes his seat, and gazes over suspiciously at the rival Dons in the room.

The next day Don Rapheal was taking a piss, and he notices one of the tiles on the wall has been defaced. 

""Don Raphael is a lousy puss""

Don Raphael doesn't like this one bit, and storms back into the bar. He let's out a furious inquisition.

 ""WHO HAS PROCLAIMED ME A PUSS. KNOW THAT THEY WILL RUE THIS DAY AS THE DAY THEY TRIED TO STEP ON DON RAPHAEL. THIS AINT OVER.

Not by a long shot.""

He walks to the phone at the end of the bar, smiles at the bartender, stuffing a 20 into the tip jar. He picks up the phone, and grabs a pencil and paper.

Not 20 minutes have passed, and an interior decorator walks out of the toilets, having replaced the defaced tile with a shiny new one. The finest work in next to no time.

This graffiti battle goes on and on for weeks, months. 

Not years, that's too long.

But the gangs get more and more angry at each other. What started with an insult on the handle of a toilet brush, has escalated to shoot-outs nightly.

A detective decides to visit the bar one day before it opens, to maybe get an insight into the politics of such a hostile situation.

He asks the bartender.

""Say, these gangsters are petty and irrational. How do you put up with them yelling and causing upset in this bar?""

The bartender leans with his hands on the bar.

""Six months ago I was watching the Dons and their squabbling, but they have always been respectful to me. I had an idea. So I went into the bathroom and wrote 'Don Trivioli shoves this brush up his ass!' on a toilet brush handle.

""And?"" The detective asks, with little patience.

The bartender shrugs and smirks.

Down on his luck and very desperate, he asks to speak to the manager of the facility, about getting a job as a toothbrush salesman. The manager walks out, and greets Joseph. “Hi there thir, my names Jotheph, and I was curiouth about being a potenthial thalseman here.” The manager chuckles &amp; shakes his head , “Sorry son, I’m not currently looking for any new salesman, and no offense, but I try and recruit people who are very clear and precise with their speaking, and er well — Joseph cuts him off, “Oh well not to worrwy at all thir, I guarwenntee you I will be the betht thalseman, you’ve ever theen!” Humoring him, the manager says “I’ll tell ya what Jospeh, I’ll give you 10 of my toothbrushes here, they sell for a dollar, come back with $10 tomorrow, and I’ll think about it.” 

Joseph takes the toothbrushes, and goes gladly on his way. He returns the next day with $10, and hands it to the manager. The manager looks at Jospeh. “Well, seeing as I just had my most trusted salesman quit ... ah what the hell, here you are Jospeh, 100 toothbrushes. Bring me back $100 by the end of the week. And I’ll consider making you one of my top salesmen. Jospeh gladly accepts, and goes on his way. He returns the very next day with $100 in cash. Astonished, the manager exclaims, “why I never .. Joseph my good man. We have an office up in the corner there.” Joseph shrills “Wow thank you thir!!” The manager then says, “Alright Jospeh, this is gonna sound insane, but here’s 1000 toothbrushes, if you can bring me back $1000 by the end of next week, I’ll make you the regional sales manager. Not only that, but we’ll give you a company car, and your own assistant.” Jospeh of course, gladly accepts and goes along his way. 

In just two days, Joseph returns with $1000, and hands it to his boss. The manager snatches the money, and confusedly yells, “Jospeh you’re incredible! I don’t understand, how do ya do it!? Before I keep on my word, you gotta show me.” So Jospeh and the manager, get into Jospeh’s car with a big box of toothbrushes and start driving. The manager notices a party size bag of chips and some dip in the back, and ask “What’s that for?” — “You’ll thee.” Jospeh says. Joseph drives them to the airport.

Once they arrive, Jospeh gets out, grabs the chips and dip, and wheels all his luggage in, along with the toothbrushes. He sets up in the terminal in the first gate, just beyond the entrance. “You sure you don’t need any help?” Chimes in the manager, Joseph replies, “Nah I got thith.” He sets up a sign that says “FREE CHIPS N DIP HERE” The manager makes a weird face and looks at Joseph, but shrugs it off.

Moments later a man walks past, and Joseph says, “Hello there thir, would you like thome free chipths and dip?” The man obliges and grabs a chip and takes a big scoop of some of the dip. The man immediately spits it out and yells “WHAT THE FUCK, THIS DIP TASTES LIKE SHIT”

This artifact was one of a kind, nobody knew exactly what it was but they knew that it was incredibly rare. Very few people knew exactly what it was.

The day of the auction came and everyone arrived at the monastery where it was being held.  A rich rapper who went by the name Nodda M. bought the artifact. Nobody knew this famous rapper’s last name, but it was rumored that the wisest of people could figure it out through his songs. After the auction was over, a host showed Nodda his artifact, a strange device that was said to generate ticking noises at night. It look extra terrestrial, and scientists had confirmed that none of the elements it was made of, could be found on the periodic table.

Nodda decided to wait until night to see whether the rumor about the ticking was really true, so the people at the monastery agreed to wait. The clock struck 11, and the ticking started. It went on for a few hours while Nodda listened with amazement.

The next morning, Nodda asked the hosts what it was, that was making the noise. 
“Please sir, tell me. I will even tell you my last name and pay and extra 500,000 dollars, as I am so curious” he begged.
“I am sorry, but this secret can only be revealed to those who possess the most knowledge about Buddhism, and I can’t tell you because you’re Nodda Munk”

At first I don't really think anything of it but after a little bit I look back and he's still on my tail. I try just going a little faster but he just speeds up too, looking really fishy and clearly trying to catch up to me (for the record I'm a woman and I was all alone). Now, I don't mean to brag but I'm built for speed, so I think maybe I can lose him if I just make a dash for it, so I dart off to my right... and sure enough he turns too.

I head through a tunnel, he's right there behind me.

I loop around and head BACK through the same tunnel, he's right there after me.

At this point he's not even trying to be subtle. He's calling after me, panting like a dog, telling me to wait for him... and finally, I just lose it. I figure I might as well get this over with, I'm bigger than him anyway.

So I suddenly slam on the brakes and turn around, and I can see he's surprised so I get all up in his face. I tell him to quit it, ask him FOUR times if he's got a problem, and less-than-politely inquire if he wants a piece of me, before just laying it on the line: ""STOP FOLLOWING ME, OKAY?!""

Anyway, turns out he just wanted help finding his son, Bingo, after some divers kidnapped him.",The Day I Was Followed:,4

Now this happens all the time in the music industry; however this rocker always handed out the same pass to many women, and never changed it.  The pass was for Tulsa OK, and he'd give out the large TULSA backstage pass on any show... Detroit MI, St. Louis MO, Orange County CA, Long Island NY... all the women got the TULSA pass.

&amp;#x200B;

The bands manager would always explain to the local crew about the pass, letting them know that it is indeed the right pass for the show, regardless of where they were playing.  Each night, many beautiful young women would surely show up to the backstage area with the same TULSA pass that the rocker loved to give out.  He explained that the young rocker wasn't very good with geography and would always give out the same pass, not even sure if he knew where Tulsa was.

&amp;#x200B;

One day they have a show, and the rocker informs his manager that one of his best friends from childhood would be in attendance, and he wants him to give him the full VIP treatment.   He gives his friend the backstage VIP treatment and they wait for the show to conclude.   After the show, the three of them are talking and having drinks, and the band manager mentions ""Our worst show, was a place where... I think it's that one place where you can see all four states, I think it's in like Nebraska, Kansas and two other states or something..""

&amp;#x200B;

Without missing a beat, the rocker gets up, states ""I'm getting another beer; but I think you mean the ""Four Corners Monument""  where the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah borders meet, due to the unique fact of right angle geometric borders in those states' corners.  Another similar attraction is the ""7 States"" visible from Lookout Mountain outside of  Chattanooga where one can see Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama on a clear day with a set of binoculars.""

&amp;#x200B;

He leaves the room to grab his beer.  Gobsmacked, the manager explains the story to the rockers' childhood friend about the TulsA passes, and how he thought the rocker knew nothing about geography.  His friend of many years replies back:

  
""Nah, he's not bad with geography, he's just dyslexic.  That's why he hands out tulsA passes to all the young ladies!""

He booked himself on a cruise and proceeded to have  the time of his life. That is, until the ship sank! He found himself on  an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts.

After about four months, he is lying on the beach one  day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.  In disbelief, he asks, 'Where did you come from? How did you get here?'  She replies, 'I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed here  when my cruise ship sank.' 'Amazing,' he notes. 'You were really lucky  to have a row boat wash up with you.' 'Oh, this thing?' explains the  woman. 'I made the boat out of raw materials I found on the island. The  oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm  branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree.' 'But,  where did you get the tools?' 'Oh, that was no problem,' replied the  woman. 'On the south side of the Island , a very unusual stratum of  alluvial rock is exposed. I found if I fired it to a certain temperature  in my kiln, it melted into ductile iron. I used that for tools and used  the tools to make the hardware.' The guy is stunned. 'Let's row over to  my place,' she says.

After a few minutes of rowing, she docks  the boat at a small wharf. As the Man looks to shore, he nearly falls  off the boat. Before him is stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow  painted in blue and white. While the woman ties up the rowboat with an  expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck. As  they walk into the house, she says casually, 'It's not much but I call it home. Sit down, please. Would you like a drink?' 'No! No thank you,'  he blurts out, still dazed. 'I can't take another drop of coconut  juice.' 'It's not coconut juice,' winks the woman. 'I have a still. How  would you like a Pina Colada?' Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk.

After  they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, 'I'm going to  slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There is a razor upstairs in the bathroom cabinet.' No longer  questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet, a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel  mechanism. 'This woman is amazing,' he muses. 'What next?'

When  he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines, strategically  positioned, and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons for him to  sit down next to her. 'Tell me,' she begins suggestively, slithering  closer to him, 'We've been out here for many months. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for?' She stares into his eyes... He swallows excitedly and tears start to form in his eyes..... . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .

The stranger offers him a plan and tells him to put a $20 bill in his inside pocket, go home and tell his wife that he hasn’t been drinking and it was a stranger that was sick down his jacket and show her the $20 the guy gave him for the cleaning bill as proof.

Finding it a bit odd that he had found this ring in America, he deduced that the ring was lost by a tourist. The man then decided, with the help of his best friend, Sean, to journey to New Zealand and return the ring. 

The couple spent weeks and weeks travelling when they eventually reached New Zealand. As they approached their destination, they were greeted by a grey wizard wearing a pointed blue hat.

“Greetings, what can I do for you?”

“Hello sir. We’ve found your ring and we’ve travelled all the way from America to return it to you!” The young man answered.

“Who would have bothered and thought to come all the way to New Zealand to return this ring?” The mysterious old wizard asked. 

Sean responded, “Not me, but my friend here, Elijah Wood.”

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed...... On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again...... On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

The pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio: ""Airbus flight, boring flight isn’t it? Take care and have a look here!”

He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, only to swoop down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. He loops back next to the Airbus and asks, ""Well, how was that?""

The Airbus pilot answers: ""Very impressive, but now have a look here!""

The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly stubbornly straight, with the same speed. After five minutes, the Airbus pilot radioed, ""Well, what are you saying now?""

The jet pilot asks confused: ""What did you do?"" The other laughs and says, ""I got up, stretched my legs, went to the back of the flight to the bathroom, got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon cake and made an appointment with the stewardess for the next three nights - in a 5 Star hotel, which is paid for by my employer.

One day the boss told the secretary that he has kept 100 dollars behind the couch in his office. She was free to bend over and take it, but the catch was that whenever she would go for it for the time she was looking for the entire amount the boss was free to do as he pleased with her. 

Seeing this as easy money she agreed. She bent over the couch and saw the 100$ bill and reached for it, the boss grabbed her butt, but as soon as she found the 100$ and stood up the boss stopped and he didn't do anything else. This continued for a couple of weeks where everyday she would come into the office and go for the 100$ bill behind the couch, it always took her less than 10 seconds with nothing ever amounting to more than a spank on her ass.

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.

But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.

Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.

Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.

But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.

Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""

Curious, Attila did as he asked.

Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.

""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.

Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.

To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

They egged their neighbor's house, TPed the one down the road, and just generally caused mischief but they were running out of original ideas to keep it fresh.

One of them decided to go down to the expressway overpass and throw rocks on the semi trucks passing underneath. By the time the driver stopped, they were obviously gone and they thought they were uncatchable.

This went on for a while but of course the local police found out about it. Since they were a small town, it was difficult for the police to constantly patrol the overpass so they instead put a high, very hefty grate on both sides of the overpass to deter the throwing of the rocks.

This made it harder for the teens to get the rocks through, but not impossible, and they continued to throw rocks to spite the local police force. 

The problem for them became the supply of rocks. They had been throwing them for long enough that there was nothing but pebbles left on the side of the road near the overpass.

One of the teenagers had the idea to put a rock on a long string, this way, he could throw the rock, have it hit the truck and then he could pull it up again to throw at the next one.

He carefully selected the biggest rock that would fit through the grate and tied it very well on a rope. He knew it would be hard to hold on to when it hit the truck so he wrapped it around his wrist for a better grip.

A large truck was coming fast down the expressway; the teenager threw the rock and it was a perfect hit. It went right through the windshield of the truck but the rock and rope got stuck and it pulled the teenager into the metal grate on the overpass. It all happened so fast - the teens arm was pulled through the grate as the truck skid to a stop but he could not fit more than his arm through the grate and the force pulled his arm completely off of his body.

Obviously at this point, when the teenager was taken to the local hospital, the police knew who was responsible for the rocks, but in a gross miscarriage of justice, it was actually the truck driver who was convicted of armed robbery.",There was a group of troubled teenagers bored in a small town.,4

One day, Ving mentioned to me how much he hated his name. 
“What kind of name is Ving? It’s so stupid,” he said, frustrated. 
“You know, you can get your name changed at city hall.” 
“Really? It’s that easy?”
“Yeah you just have to fill out some paperwork.” I paused. “I can drive you if you want.”
“Thanks dude. What would I even change my name to though?”
“How about something common that holds on to your roots? Something like Lee.”
“Lee. I like it.”
Unfortunately, Ling had overheard our talk and launched into a tirade about how his name had been in the family for generations and he couldn’t just throw away his heritage like that. Ving was set though. The next day, we drove to city hall. Ling insisted on coming along, hoping to convince Ving to change his mind. She complained the entire way. Ving wasn’t deterred though. We finally got to city hall and got the paperwork. As he was filling it out, Ving’s face changed. 
“What’s wrong?” I asked. “You’ve been excited all day and yesterday for this.”
“I know, I know. It’s just— it’s my dad’s name too. I don’t know.” Ving sighed. “I don’t think I can go through with it.”
Ling looked relieved. The receptionist noted that there was a small cancellation fee. Ling happily took out some money. Suddenly, an Asian man in Ray-Bans, neon shorts, and an American flag T-shirt bursted through the doors. 
“Dad!” Ving, tears streaming down his face, ran to embrace his father. Ving Sr. smiled at his son.

Seeing the penguin out of the corner of his eye the mechanic says, “Well sir, it looks like you’ve blown a seal.”

“Nah,” the penguin replies, “I’m just eating ice cream. “",A penguin’s car breaks down in a small town.,8

“Yeah you, sheep shagger! Fucking sheep shagger!” slurred the man, before throwing his beer can into some petunia bushes and stumbling off in the other direction.

 “The youth of today”, Llewelyn thought as he crossed the road and headed towards the bakery. The door chimed as he entered and he found Tom the baker pulling out a tray of fresh baked welsh-cakes.

“Just made ‘em special for you, Jonesy” said Tom when he looked up.

“You know me, Tom. Can’t get enough of ‘em. Remind me of home, so they do” he answered, savouring the smell. “Just like me mam would bake back home in the valleys.”

“Well I don’t know if I can do them as well as the Welsh can, but I’ll give you them at half price to make up for it. How’s that?”

“Lord love you. You’re a good man, Tom”

“Nay bother at all, mate.”

“Well thanks again, all the same. Anyway, I must be back to the old lady. Take care of yourself, Tom.” Llewellyn said as he walked out the door.

“You too. Mind how you go, Sheep Shagger” Tom replied, as the door chimed closed.

“Bloody hell, what’s gotten into people today?” Llewellyn thought as he headed down the high street. 

He had just walked past the post office when Rose called out to him from the door.

“Oh Jonesy! Jonesy! I’ve had a parcel come for you from Llangollen.” Rose trilled as she minced towards him, “here you are, love.”

“Thanks Rose. This’ll be that knitted scarf from me mum. She likes to keep herself busy, you know.”

“Well I think it’s nice she thinks of her little boy. Anyway, I’ve got to go. You have a nice day and send my love to Gwen”

“I will. B-bye”

“Bye, sheep shagger.”


Llewelyn Jones was feeling pretty shocked by now. “Silly English, bat” he thought. But he refused to let it trouble him and resumed his walk back home.

Making his way through the town he was suddenly surrounded by a gang of teenagers on bikes, riding circles around him and yelling “sheep shagger! Sheep shagger!” over and over again. He rushed past mumbling something about the “Bloody English. Always showing their true colours” but then he found himself greeted by even more shouts of “sheep shagger” from passers-by. More and more people joined in and their jeering followed him all the way home. “Fucking English arseholes”, he yelled back over his shoulder as he reached his front door and the cries of 'sheep shagger' finall began to recede. “Fucking prejudiced twats, the lot of you” he yelled. 

He was still muttering to himself in the hallway when his wife asked him what the matter was from the living room.  

“Those petty minded, English, buggers! That's what the matter is. Pure xenophobia, that's what it is! I’m a good honest man and I’ve been a pillar of this community for years, but do they care? No, those ignorant, bigoted wankers don’t give a damn. You do everything for them but it’s all forgotten when they remember their old prejudices. You help raise money for the church roof.  You put up some of your own money for the football pitch. You drive the old dears to the hospital when they brake their hips falling down the stairs. You help salt the roads in the winter. You help coach the choir. You give them the best years of your life. But you shag one fucking sheep…”","“Oi, you!”",4

the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""

shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to
