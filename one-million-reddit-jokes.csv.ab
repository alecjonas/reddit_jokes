Since this criminal was known to have pulled off such fantastic heists before, it was no doubt that he would eventually successfully achieve this goal, which meant that the police station was on high alert for the criminal. The police didn't know who this criminal was, but they had a few clues: he spoke spanish, a language not well known throughout the city, and he also had a knack for disguises and false identities, which meant he could be anyone, and the police has not been stopping to figure out who he is.

""But, fortunately, we managed to get his identity, and we caught the damn bastard last night!"" the police interrogator exclaimed in the interrogation room, infront of the criminal. ""*Un*fortunately, he's already managed to steal the money, and has hidden it somewhere safe, and I want him to tell me where that is. Except I don't speak spanish, and nor does anyone in this damn building, so that's why we need YOU, the translator,"" he points to the other man in the room, ""to get him to tell us where he hid it. Let's start.""

The interrogator spoke first. ""Ask him, where does he keep the money?""
The translator asked the criminal, and he spoke back in unfamiliar words. ""He says he will not tell,"" said the translator.
The interrogator said, ""Tell him to speak up, or we will put him to death sentence for his crimes.""
The translator spoke accordingly, and the criminal seemed so visibly frightened by this, that he immediately told him its location. ""By the old graveyard, under the second tree from the entrance! There's the money bags!"" he said in Spanish.

Trying to keep a grin, the translator decievingly told the interrogator that ""he would rather die, than tell you where he has hidden it."" Then the interrogator knew.

Suddenly, both the interrogator and the 'criminal' took a handgun out and pointed it at the translator. The interrogator said, in perfect spanish, ""Skilled robber my ass, all it took was a clever lie!""","A skilled, anonymous criminal was infamously wanted for multiple cases of robbery and theft.",12

And he looks down, and he takes a deep breath, and he leaps off, and he starts flapping his arms.

And he starts flying! And he flies all around
the big top! He goes all the way around the place. He goes around the center pole. He goes loop-de-loop through the trapezes. 

Then he gets all the way up, and he takes a nosedive right down to the ground, flapping his arms like mad. And he lands right next to the boss. And he says ""Well, what do ya think?""

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he‚Äôd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.

The girl wasn't quite ready, so her father  invited the lad to sit on the couch and wait. Dad sat in his easy chair and proceeded to read his newspaper, while the family dog, Rover, jumped onto the couch and sniffed out the stranger. 

Suddenly, the young man felt the urge to fart and didn't know what to do, however, since the dog was nearby, he decided to squeak it out and feign innocence. 

""Brrroough,"" went the fart! Dad peered over his newspaper and said, ""Rover! Get off that couch!"" 

The young man was relieved. Obviously, Dad thought Rover had done the deed. Soon, another fart rumbled in the young man's guts, and he let it rip, assured that Rover would once again be blamed. 

Sure enough, Dad peered over his newspaper and said more sharply, ""Rover! I said get off the couch!"" 

Happily, the young man decided that he could fart whenever the urge arose and he let yet another one fly. 

Finally, Dad threw down his newspaper in disgust and bellowed, ""Rover! FOR GOD'S SAKE, GET OFF THAT COUCH BEFORE HE CRAPS ON YOU!!!""",Crap,13

Wondering what noise was, he stops his car and gets out to look. While he's standing there a newfie pulls up and asks him what's going on.

The mainlander says, ""I'm just here visiting your fair province and I seem to have killed one of your animals.""

The newfie takes a look at the rabbit and says, 
""No problem, by‚Äôs. Hang'er down a few.""

The newfie then goes to his truck and gets an aerosol spray-can, which he proceeds to empty onto the rabbit. When he's done he chucks the empty and says, ""There ya go, me son. Enjoy yer stay"" then gets in his truck and takes off.

The rabbit gets up, hops 10 feet towards the woods, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, and finally disappears into the woods.

The Mainlander is blown away. Wondering what the newfie did, he grabs the can out of the ditch and reads the label, which says: ""Hair spray. Gauranteed to bring dead hair back to life with a permanent wave""",A classic Canadian Joke.,38

They immediately impounded the aircraft  and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot‚Äôs story was  that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he  was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI  background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the  investigation.  
 By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was  lost and wasn‚Äôt a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying ‚Äúyou-did-not-see-a-base‚Äù briefing, complete with threats of  spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way  on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.  
 The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the  same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP‚Äôs surrounded the plane‚Ä¶  only this time there were two people in the plane.

He eventually built a cabin, had a functioning automatic potable water supply, and all sorts of little clever commodities, all done to make her life easier... it was the most effort any man had ever done for her, and all the hard work made him fit, she noticed this...

One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her succesfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life.

But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... ""Whats wrong?"" Scarlett Johansson asked, ""Nothing..."" the guy would say...

She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasnt asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...

    ""Really?, youll do anything id like?""

    ""yes"" she said ""anything!""

    ""ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shore""

    ""ok...""

    ""now put this shirt on please, but first, ""tape"" your boobs so they are flat""

    ""wha... ok, id say id do anything"" she said lovingly.

    ""ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under it""

she was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tuck her hair under the hat.

    ""Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustache""

    ""ok... if this is what you want..."" she muttered.

    ""now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach ill catch up to you in a bit"" he said a bit excited...

She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasnt her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: ""DUDE!!! you wont believe who ive been fucking for the past 6 months!""","A shipwreck, only Scarlett Johansson and some random dude survived on an deserted island...",144

So the trooper takes the pope's registration back to his cruiser and radios his sergeant. ""I got a situation here,"" he says.

""What, did you pull the mayor over again? I thought I warned you about that,"" the sergeant says. ""No,"" says the trooper. ""It's worse than that.""

""Well, what, did you pull the governor over?"" says the sergeant. ""No,"" says the trooper. ""It's worse than that.

""Holy moley, did you pull the President over?"" says the sergeant. ""No ... worse than that.""

The guide turned to him and said, ""Drums okay, but VERY BAD when they stop.""

As they traveled the drums grew louder and louder. The anthropologist was nervous, but the guide merely repeated, ""Drums okay. Drums not bad. When drums stop, then very bad!""

Then the drums suddenly stopped. Terrified, the anthropologist yelled to the guide: ""The drums stopped! What now?""

Assuming that the mom was one of those anti-vaxxers, he prepares a number of pro-vaccination pamphlets to prepare to convince her to the benefits of vaccination.

The mom says, ""I don't need pro-vaccination pamphlets. I'm 100% pro-vaccination.""

Relieved, the doctor said: ""Well, then I'll administer the vaccines right away.""

However, the mom said: ""No need. The kid is already vaccinated.""

The doctor said: ""No, I assure you that according to official records, your kid is most certainly not vaccinated. Do you have any documents proving the child is vaccinated?""

The mom said: ""Yes, the proof is that my child is alive.""

The doctor was like: ""Pardon me?""

The mom explains: ""Vaccines saves lives, and children without vaccines die. It is hard, scientific fact that no child can survive without vaccination, so the fact my child is alive proves he is vaccinated.""

The doctor said: ""I'm sorry, but you must have heard some misinformation. Vaccines greatly increase a child's survival rate, but child could survive without vaccines. A child being alive is not proof that he or she is vaccinated.""

The mom was shocked: ""I can't believe they would let an ANTI-VAXXER be a doctor! You're one of those idiots that believe children could survive without vaccines? What do you take me for, an idiot? You are the reason all these children don't get vaccinated. Not only should you lose your license, you should go to jail.""

The doctor said: ""No, ma'am. I'm very pro-vaccination. I've performed thousands of vaccinations just last year. I'm just sticking to the facts. You need to get your child vaccinated.""

The mom screamed: ""We have an anti-vax doctor in the house! He's trying to convince me that children can survive without vaccines!!""

The entire hospital went up in arms. What? An anti-vaxxer doctor working in the hospital spreading misinformation?

The entire hospital chanted: ""Throw him out! Throw him out!""

After they threw out the doctor and everyone who supported him, the hospital thanked the mother for her service in helping spreading the benefits of vaccination.

""Remember, vaccination saves lives."" Said the mother. ""But we have much work to do. We must inform everyone that children couldn't survive without vaccines. The problem is much bigger than us.""

Pondering about how to spread the message, someone gets an idea.

""Why don't we flood reddit with anti-vax jokes, and label anyone who disagrees with us an an anti-vaxxer?""

""Sounds like a great idea.""

For decades, the king's had argued over it's true owner, each claiming to be the first kingdom to settle there, and many tales of magical swords and godly favours to claim divine right. Eventually, this storytelling and legal battling came to no conclusion, so the kings decided to go to war.

The first kingdom is very wealthy, and has a grand army of thousands of Knights in shining armour with state of the art squires and weaponry, expertly trained killing machines.

The second kingdom is moderately well off, and has several hundred Knights in standard armour with enough squires to get by, but all willing in heart and mind.

The third kingdom is very poor, and has only one elderly Knight with his great grandson for a squire, in rusty centuries old armour.

On the eve before the battle, each kingdom decides to have a celebration for the great deeds that are about to be done.

The first kingdom has a great banquet that no words can give justice to, a massive, endless hall of food and delight, dancers and jesters and bards as plentiful as the fine wine and boar that accompanies them.

The second kingdom has not nearly as grand an occasion, but makes the most of what they have, making up for the lack of fine food and entertainment with enough ale to knock out an elephant.

The third kingdom has but scraps to make do with. In fact, so little food do they have that there is only enough for the Knight and boy squire alone to have a feast (a feast by their standards, at least). The elderly Knight is too weak and tired to get up, so the squire prepares the meal. He decides to cook a stew, so hangs a pot over a fire with a noose and cooks what they have into a small broth.

Finally, the great day dawns. The kings did not sleep through the night, and sent their generals to ready their armies. The world sat on tenterhooks.

However, fate had taken a strange turn. The armies from the first and second kingdoms had drunk so much in their revels that not one remained conscious, much to the fury of their leaders. And in the third kingdom, the elderly Knight's back had perished due to old age. The kings were left speechless. There was only one option.

The squires must go to war.

So on the battlefield, a hundred thousand squires in tunics too big for them and wooden swords trampled the ground beneath them as they came to the edge. One gigantic behemoth of an army met the other small but willing force at the peak of the lake.

And the squire of the third kingdom faced them all.

The battle began. Heads were clubbed in, backs broken, knees twisted, hair pulled, and slowly the numbers remaining dwindled. As the hours swept by and the body piles grew high, the kings and their people watched in the greatest suspense the lake ever knew.

And as the sun set, and the dust cleared, finally, a single figure stood atop the mountain of bodies beneath him, victorious. The squire of the third kingdom had won.

This goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is greater than the sum of the squires of the other two sides of the triangle.",Three kingdoms border a lake in the shape of an obtuse triangle,36

Dear Mrs. Harris:

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.
We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store.

Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.

3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.

4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.

5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.

6. August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.

8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called.

9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

11. October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.

12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels.

13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'

14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;
'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'

15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room?

And last, but not least:

16. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' One of the clerks passed out.","RETIRED HUSBAND After I retired, my wife insisted that I accompany her on her trips to WalMart. Unfortunately, like most men; I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.",7

The reporter head out into the community and comes across a farmer at the the side of the road mending a fence.

 I was wondering if you could tell me a story that made you happy?

Well young man, one time, the farmer down the road lost a sheep. We got a posse, went out, found it, fucked it and brought it back.

**Excerpts from the diary of a cat:**

Day 983 of my captivity...

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets.

Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.

The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet.

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a ‚Äògood little hunter‚Äô I am.

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of ‚Äòallergies.‚Äô I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow ‚Äî but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded.

The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now...",Excerpts from the diary of pets,36

The gatekeeper agrees that this was a pretty horibke way to die and lets the first man in to heaven then he asks the second man how he died. The second man answers:

So every day i do some workout on my balcony but today i fell over the edge and started falling but i was fortunate enough to grab onto the balcony below mine so naturaly i started climbing up to try not to fall the remaining 17 floors but before i even start to climb a man comes out on the balcony and sees me hanging there he gets realy angry and starts hiting my hands but i managed to hold on then the madman walks inside and gets a hammer when he started  hiting my fingers with that i couldnt hold on anymore so i fell but landed in a bush and survived but the the lunetic went inside and got his fridge witch he dropt on me and i died

I travel around the world, speaking at various software engineering conferences. I was recently invited to speak at the premier aviation conference in the world on the subject of writing safety critical software.

I need to be engaging, bring in the audience, and make it all feel personal and real. As usual, I started off with a pretty standard presentation, introducing myself, establishing credibility, talking about the subject matter. But about 15 minutes in, I had everyone in the audience stand up, then I outline a new, hypothetical project and tell them they must evaluate it. I gave them the specifications of an aircraft and a deadline at which the project must be completed. I then told them I would ask them a few questions, and if their answer was ""no"", they could sit down, but if their answer was ""yes"", they remain standing.

""Would your marketing department would sell this package?"" Everybody remained standing.

""Could your team deliver this on time?"" About half of the audience sat down.

At this point, I knew I had them. ""Would you be willing to put yourself, your friends, and your family on this plane's first flight?"" At this point, the audience kind of grins at each other sheepishly, and slowly everyone sits down. But this time, one man remained standing. I saw this as a great opportunity, fully expecting a discussion about software testing, or something like that, so I asked him, ""You, sir! Tell me, why is that you alone among all of these people have the courage and confidence to put your loved ones on the line?""

The father looked confused. ""Well that sounds harmless, maybe your mother is overreacting. Ok son, tell me what you told your mother.""  
The son smiled, took a big breath, and exclaimed ""Well first you need to find the asshole who took the tape measure, and then you need to measure the fucking frame, and then you need to make sure the fat lazy fuck bought the right size door, and the other asshole actually made the frame right. And then chances are the fucking pins wont line up when you put the fucking door in the frame, so you need to hammer that sonnofabitch until the fucking piece of shit slams in. And THAT'S how you install a door""  
The father's face turned bright red with anger. He pointed out the door and yelled ""That's IT! Go outside and bring me a switch!""  
The boy stood defiantly and said ""Fuck you dad, that's the Electricians job!""  
\*note. back in the day a switch was a flexible thin stick that assholes beat their kids with.\*",Learning from Construction workers *long*,5

He buys an old empty farm. Going to the local general store by his new homestead, he asks where he can get some animals. The owner tells him to go to Old Man Murphy‚Äôs farm down the road a ways and he will get him all set up with a few animals. Excited the man heads over to the farm. Upon meeting, Old Man Murphy says to the gentleman I can definitely tell you‚Äôre a city slicker- Don‚Äôt worry, in time you‚Äôll settle in and be just like one of us. The gentleman than asks well, how about that little hen over there. Maybe I can purchase it from you. Surely that would be a great animal to start with. Old Man Murphy says sure, I‚Äôll sell you that one. But, just so you know young hens are actually called pullets. The gentleman sees a donkey off to the side and says well, that looks like a great animal to have at my new farm they are actually called an ass, right? How about I buy him from you. Old Man Murphy says now you‚Äôre starting to sound like a farmer. Yes, I‚Äôll sell him to you but, he‚Äôs kind of stubborn. Sometimes he just lays down and won‚Äôt move. If you scratch on his back a bit he will get right back up and moving. Lastly, the gentleman says well no farm would be complete without a rooster. How about that one right there. Old Man Murphy says sure but, just so you know a rooster is actually called a cock. The gentlemen says oh yeah that makes sense. He thanks Old Man Murphy and starts the walk back to his own farm holding the birds and leading the donkey. About halfway back to his farm the donkey lays down in the middle of the road when suddenly a shiny red sports car pulls up with a beautiful woman driving. A little aggravated that she can‚Äôt pass by because of the animal blocking her way. She scoffs at the gentleman. He looks at her and said I‚Äôll get him out of the way in just minute ma‚Äôam but, I need a favor to make that happen. She hesitantly says ok.

Per usual Shirley started her cleaning regiment, and per usual Spencer and Sprinkles were in her way. After countless times of foot prints on her perfectly clean floors, Shirley broke down and sent Spencer and Sprinkles outside to occupy themselves.  


  It was about forty-five minuets later, and Shirley was dusting the blinds. As she's dusting she's sees Spencer and Sprinkles sitting on the curb in front of the house. She thought 'How cute'. As she watched, she saw Spencer throw some M&amp;M's in the air catch them in his mouth, pick up Sprinkles lift Sprinkles tail up, and lick, He then proceeded to scoot one foot down the curb. Shirley couldn't believe what she saw.. She proceeded to watch him do it again; throw the M&amp;M's up,  catch them in his mouth, pick the cat up, lift its tail, lick, and scoot down the curb a foot. 

 Shirley being very appalled ran outside. She asked Spencer with a tone only a confused mother could have "" What in the holy hell are you doing?!?!""

They do just about everything together. And one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching MTV, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says ""you know what? I'm gonna learn how to do that.""

So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, ""Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""no problem. Come on down.""

""No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse.""

""Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.""

So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like ""LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says ""holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?"" And horse says ""Bass. Learn to play bass.""

So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, miss, come on down.""

""Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow.""

""Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.""

So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says ""Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.""

Horse says ""Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.""

So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, man. Come on down.""

""Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken.""

""Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.""

So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like ""what the fuck? that sounds amazing."" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says ""Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE.""

So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say ""Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.""

Horse says ""Thanks, guys. you're the best,"" and he takes off.

Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself ""Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.""

So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says ""Hey. Why the long face?""","So there‚Äôs this farm. On this farm, there‚Äôs a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.",2697

Watson rubs his bleary eyes, unsure what to make of Sherlocks sudden midnight curiosity. He rolls over and stares up into the sky, which was lit up with a million stars like diamonds on black velvet.

Watson responds. ""Well Holmes, as I stare into the cosmos, I can see that we are on a spinning ball in an infathomable expanse of nothing. The vast emptiness of space and scale of the universe leaves me feeling incredibly tiny, and therefore I deduce that our lives are small and insignificant in the greater scheme of things.""

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.",Being Muslim is tough,4502

Well, she's a natural at it, so after a couple of weeks of instruction, the pro suggests she go out and play 9 holes.

Early the next morning, she's ready for a 7:00 tee time. She tees up the ball and drives it 155 yards right down the fairway.

As she's walking to her lie, however, she gets stung by a bee, and her approach shot to the green is affected by the pain.

She shoots one over par on the hole, but before she tees up on the second hole, the pain from the bee sting is too much for her, and she heads back to the clubhouse.

The pro sees her coming, and runs out, wondering what's wrong. She tells him about the bee sting, and he asks where it happened.

""Between the first and second hole"" she replied.

The pro nodded sagely and said ""I see your problem. Your stance is too wide"".",Another Golfing Woman Joke,6

After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

The Episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. They sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.

But the Catholic church came up with a more very creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

And not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue. They took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since","In a small American town, a band of squirrels had become quite a problem.",42

The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete.

post,fqkexs,2qh72,jokes,false,1585403010,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqkexs/my_father_ladies_and_gentlemen/,self.jokes,,"So, when we were younger we used to run a single line off the back of one of the snowmobiles, put a splitter on her with two lengths of ski rope about 25' long, gear up with helmets and suits, and throw two guys on on those flying saucers, (you know, like the ones on National Lampoon's Vacation) and then the sled driver would just ‚Äúgiver‚Äù down some snow covered back roads. 

Holding the rope with one hand you could steer the saucer by leaning. Object of the game was to knock the other guy off, preferably when he was on or near what were sometimes 10' embankments of ploughed snow at the side of the road. 

Hell of a lot of harmless fun for the most part, until one day it went bad. 

Paul and I had been bashing the hell out of each other for a while, and no one was coming off. I came at him quickly from my side of the road and made the initial impact with him just seconds before an old Ford Econoline ‚Äúshagging wagon‚Äù with the classic big ole cb antenna on it, came round the bend in front of us. 

Long enough story short, I managed to stay over in our lane behind the sled, but as fate and all the timing that goes with it would have it, the van came even with us just as Paul bounced up the embankment, off a tree, and flipped over, on the wrong side of the road. 

Again, in a horrible twist of fate, he came down near the top of the van‚Äôs windshield, and the motion of the impact basically impaled him on the antenna that was jutting up from the top of the van. 

He survived the initial impact but later died in hospital. His blood system was poisoned by some ailment related to the dead insects that had beat him to the antenna. 

Maybe if he had had a flak jacket on he might have made it. 

Be careful out there folks. We all did some pretty risky stuff when we were younger. 

Wear protection.
