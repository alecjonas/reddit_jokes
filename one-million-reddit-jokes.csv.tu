After a fulfilling life with the now-dead prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother.

Cinderella said, ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?""

The fairy godmother replied, ""Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish: ""The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks, and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.""

Instantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.

Cinderella said, ""Ooh, thank you, Fairy Godmother!""

The fairy godmother replied, ""It is the least that I can do. What do you want for your second wish?""

Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, ""I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.""

At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned - and Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years.

Then the fairy godmother spoke once more: ""You have one more wish; what shall it be?""

Cinderella looked over to the frightened cat in the corner and said, ""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a kind and handsome young man.""

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.

The fairy godmother said, ""Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life."" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone as suddenly as she appeared.

For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.

Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young, muscular arms. He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered....

""Bet you're sorry now that you cut my nuts off!""

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.

The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'

The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.

She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'

'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.

'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon."" She hears the little boy continue, ""For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train.

 On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars!

 Jerry said, We've got to give it back.

 Sally said, Finders keepers. She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.

 The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?

 Sally said, No.

 Jerry said, She’s lying. She hid it up in the attic.

 Sally said, Don't believe him, he’s getting senile

 The agents turned to Jerry and began to question him.  

 One said: Tell us the story from the beginning.

 Jerry said, Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday ..

 The first police officer turned to his partner and said, Were outta here!",Good old Seniors,15

Hillary told her driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners what had happened and pay them for the cow. She stayed in the car making phone calls.
 
About an hour later the driver staggered back to the car with his clothes in disarray. He was holding a half-empty bottle of expensive wine in one hand, a huge Cuban cigar in the other, and was smiling happily, smeared with lipstick.
 
""What happened to you?,"" asked Hillary .
 
""Well,"" the driver replied, ""the farmer gave me the cigar, his wife gave me the wine, and their beautiful twin daughters made passionate love to me.""
 
""What did you tell them?"" asked Hillary.
 
The driver replied, ""I just stepped inside the door and said, 'I'm Hillary Clinton's driver and I've just killed the old cow.' The rest happened so fast I couldn't stop it.""

Man 1: Well, you see, I had been suspecting that my wife was cheating on me lately. In order to catch her in the act, I came home to our apartment from work a few hours earlier. She was naked in the bed. I became enraged and started looking around the house for the man but could not find him. I ran out to the balcony and I saw hands hanging from the railing. I was so furious that with all my rage I summoned the strength to pick up our refrigerator and threw it over at him so he would fall to his death. That was when my wife shot me for killing her lover and she said she never loved me.

St. Peter: Wow, i'm very sorry to hear about your wife cheating and killing you. That is a terrible way to die. Let's hear the next story.

Man 2: Well, I was out on my balcony of my apartment building watering some plants when a bird flew at my head and scared me. I tripped and fell over the railing. Lucky, I caught on the the railing of the balcony just below mine. I saw a man exit his house and I was about to ask for his help when he quickly re-entered the house, then came back carrying a fridge! I was so confused, and then the bastard just threw the fridge over and it caused me to let go and fall to my death, with the fridge crushing all my bones.""

Step 2. Wear the jeans around and buy matching shoes and/or boots depending on climate.

Step 3. Buy some mid-price t-shirts that you think you look great in. The right width and length for your body type.

Step 4. Go into club Monoco and/or J Crew and get fitted for some Oxford cotton button downs. One in white. One in blue. Make sure it fits. Pick up a white dress shirt while you are at it. Get one with a collar that matches your face. I like small spread collars. Some people have tall necks and need taller collars.

Step 5. Only now can you start dressing up. WeR your jeans with OCBD and treat yourself to a navy blazer. Make sure it fits. Not baggy. Not long. Try it on with your shirt tucked into your jeans.

Step 6. Go out wearing your blazer and your dress shirt to the pants store. Pick up some dressier pants to replace the jeans. Olive chinos? Grey slacks? Whichever looks right. Wear it. Tuck your shirt into it.

Step 7. Now you can shop for a tie or two to complete the outfit.

Step 8. Realize you have a few pants, a few shirts, a couple ties, and a couple pairs of shoes to all interchage and one inconspicuous blazer to throw on top. Wear every combination you own with and without the blazer and ties at this point for a full day outside of home. Once you reached that point, start adding one new item a time. Are you needing more shirt variety? More pants? Another tie? Weather too hot? Then you just need more t shirts all along. Weather too cold? If so, get a couple sweaters and another blazer.

Before you enter heaven, I will be assigning each of you a vehicle based upon your fidelity in your relationship with your wife. We will start with you, sir.""

He tells the loan officer that he is going to India for some business for 2 weeks and needs to borrow $5000

The loan officer tells him that the bank will need some form of security for the loan.

So the Indian man hands over the keys and the documents to his new Ferrari parked on the street in front of the bank.

The loan officer consults the president of the bank, and everything checks out to be OK.

The loan officer agrees to accept the car as a security for the loan.

The president and loan officer had a good laugh at the Indian for keeping a $750,000 Ferrari as a security and taking only $5000 as a loan. 

An employee then drives the Ferrari into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. 

Two weeks later the Indian man returns and pays $5000 and the interest of $15.41.

The loan officer was glad that the transaction turned out well, but was a little puzzled. He tells the Indian man that while he was away, they checked him out and found out that he was a multi-millionaire. Why do you need a $5000 loan?

The Indian man replies ""Where else in NYC can I park my car for 2 weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?""",An Indian man walks into a NYC bank,25

One room has a clerk who inputs computerized records of what each applicant did on his or her last day of life.

The first applicant of the day explains that his last day was not a good one. ""I came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed. She claimed she had just gotten out of the shower. Well, her hair was dry and I checked the shower and it was completely dry too. I knew she was into some hanky-panky and I began to look for her lover. I went onto the balcony of our 9th floor apartment and found the SOB clinging to the rail by his finger tips. I was so angry that I began bashing his fingers with a flower pot. He let go and fell, but his fall was broken by some awnings and bushes. On seeing he was still alive I found super human strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over. It hit the man and killed him. At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a massive heart attack and died.

The clerk thanked him and sent him on to the next office.

The second applicant said that his last day was his worst. ""I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment. I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th floor
apartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot. I fell but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up I saw a huge chest falling toward me. I tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest.""

The clerk couldn't help but chuckle as he directs the man to the next room.

He is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters. He apologizes and says ""I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the fellow in here just before you.""

""I don't know"" replies the man,  ""picture this, I'm buck naked, hiding in this cedar chest.....""","""The Last Day""",29

He got this obsession of tractors from his parents who run a farm, so he's surrounded by tractors everyday. Life was great for him until one day there was an accident at the farm. He came home from school and he saw his parents' bodies crushed by his favourite tractor. From that day he grew a fear and hatred for tractors. 10 years later he got into university and started dating. On their third date they went to a sushi restaurant, they were queuing outside when a middle-aged man started smoking in the line. Timmy's date started coughing from inhaling the smoke and Timmy was having none of that. He took a heavy puff of the smoke from the air and cleared the smoke from his date. She was amazing at how he managed to capture all of the smoke, so she asked him in awe, 'How did you just do that?' Timmy replied with, 'Well, I am an ex-tractor fan.' ;)",Little Timmy loved tractors.,4
