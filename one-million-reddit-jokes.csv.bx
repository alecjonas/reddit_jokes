He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think i could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what that sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm \*dying\* to know. If the only way i can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do i become a monk?""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, ""I have travelled the earth and found what you have asked for. There are 145236284232 blades of grass and 231281219999129382 sand pebbles on the earth.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the wa to the sound.""

The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is right behind that door.""

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, ""Real funny. May i have the key?""

The monk gives him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door there is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monk say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But i can't tell you what it is, becouse you're not a monk.

""Hey fox! What you doing bro? Smoking weed? You know that stuff is bad for you! Let's go for a run instead! Running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

The fox, slightly embarrassed of his smoking habit now that the rabbit made such a fuss, decides ""What the hell. Maybe you're right. Okay fuck this stuff, let's go for a run!"" And rips the paper and throws the weed away, and they both take off on their run.

A bit farther down the path, they run into a deer. When they get closer, they notice the deer is in the process of rolling up a joint. Instantly the rabbit stops in front of the deer.

""Hey deer! What you doing bro? Getting high? You're wasting your life away! Come with us. Let's go for a run instead! Running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

The deer, nervous from being called out by his peers, and not wanting to be the only loser using drugs, decides ""You guys are right. What's the point? This is a habit I need to kick!"" And rips the paper and throws the weed away, and the three take off on their run.

A bit farther down the path, they run into a squirrel, in his tiny little hands is a tiny little paper and a tiny amount of weed, in the process of being rolled into a tiny little joint. The rabbit, being at the front of the group, stops right in front of the squirrel.

""Hey squirrel! What you doing bro? Drugs again? Aren't you bored of the same old shit? Come with us, bro. Let's go for a run instead! Running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

The squirrel, being a friend of the deer and the fox, and painfully aware that he usually gets invitations from them to smoke and he never returns the favor, curses his own selfishness and decides ""You guys are right. This isn't who I want to be. Enough of this!"" And rips the tiny paper and throws the bit of weed away, and the four take off on their run.

A bit further down the path, as they get closer to a clearing, they start to smell the stench of Marijuana. When they arrive at the clearing they see a monkey with a bong in his hand letting out a massive cloud of smoke, and when he notices the rabbit, he immediately starts giggling.

""Oh, rabbit!"" He says, when the giggles subside. ""You always do this! Every time I get you high, you take off running!""",A fox is trying to relax on his day off and decides to smoke a joint...,7

They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Donegal and he lived in Kerry . Paddy consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. Off he went with his sister to Marks and Spencer’s and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. Marks and Spencer’s had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Paddy unknowingly got the knickers. Good old Paddy sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter. 
Dear Maggie 
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. 
I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.
When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.
Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.
All my love,
Patrick 
P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",A joke my dad told me,58

The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American history.Who said 'Give me Liberty, or give me Death?'""

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Jose, who had his hand up. ""Patrick Henry, 1775.""

""Very good!"" apprised the teacher. ""Now, who said, ""Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth?""

Again, no response except from Jose :""Abraham Lincoln, 1863.""

The teacher snapped at the class, ""Class, you should be ashamed! Jose, who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do!""

She heard a loud whisper: ""Screw the Mexicans!""

""Who said that? "" she demanded.

Jose put his hand up. ""Jim Bowie, 1836.

At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.""

The teacher glared and asked, ""All right! Now, who said that?""

Again, Jose answered, ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""

Now furious, another student yelled, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!""

Jose jumped out of his chair waving his hand and shouting to the teacher, ""Bill Clinton to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""

The teacher fainted, and as the class gathered around her on the floor, someone said, ""Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble now!""

Jose whispered, ""Saddam Hussein, 2003.""

Finally someone throws an eraser at Jose, someone shouted ""Duck""!

Shortly after take-off, the Pope took a crossword puzzle out of his carry on bag and began writing in the answers.

""This is fantastic!” the gentleman mused. “I’m really good at crosswords!”

It crossed his mind that if the Pope got stuck, he’d ask him for assistance.

Almost as if providence struck, the Pope turned to the man and said, “Excuse me, but do you know a four-letter word referring to a woman that ends in ‘unt’?”

The three Cardinals behind, in front of, and beside him shrunk down in their seats, as far as possible, all looking for something on the floor.

The gentleman was in morbid shock.

He couldn’t breathe.

He thought within himself, thought deeper, longer for a plausible answer and after almost a minute, the dark clouds of evil parted in his mind and the sun shone in.

Turning to the Pope, the gentleman said with reverence and politeness, “I believe, Your Holiness, that you’re looking for the word, 'aunt’.”

Some manage to secure a spot on the river before the rush, and the spots are taken instantly. Ones that slept in are too late and have to move on to the next one. Some of them will never find gold, even the.miners in the river have no guarantees.

All the miners that muss their opportunity move on, except for one.

For a week, a miner wearing blue overalls and a large hat sits in his wagon and watched the other miners work.

An unlucky miner looks for a long time, but finds no gold in his reserved spot. He sighs, and packs his things. Before he goes, he makes a sign and puts it in his reserved spot that says, ""No gold here""

The miner with the large hat leaps out of his wagon, runs to the abandoned spot and rips the sign out.

The first miner looks back at him. ""Wot you doin' dere, boy?"" He says. ""Dincha see da sign? Dere ain't no gold dere.""

The miner with the large hat put the sign back in its place in the river. ""Dere is now.""

The first miner scratches his head. ""Wotcha mean?""

""I takes da sign out and put it back in."" The miner with the large hat says. ""You always get gold for repostin'!""","It is 1850 in California, where a group of miners are looking for gold.",5

Satan: Nah, you've got us all wrong. Hell is pretty okay. When you were alive, did you drink?

Man: Yeah, I drank way too much actually.

Satan: Well, every Wednesday, we fill Hell end to end with beer, liquor, wine, and other alcoholic drink you haven't even begun to imagine! You can drink and drink until you puke, then drink some more! And you don't have worry about alcohol poisoning, because you're already dead.

Man: Wednesdays sound fun. What about illegal drugs? I did a lot of those too.

Satan: You're in luck! Every Thursday, Hell is stacked miles high with every kind of mind-altering drug you can imagine. Uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and more. You can consume as much as you want, then take more! A you don't have to worry about overdosing, because you're already dead.

Man: Hell sounds all right!

Satan: Yes! When you were alive, were you gay?

Man: No, I'm straight.

Satan: ...Oh man, you're going to HATE Fridays!",A man dies and finds himself in Hell.,142

""The labor unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.""

""To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.""

So how about running with a purpose? What the doc recommends is getting a hoop. A hoop? Yes, the child's toy, you run along beside it , touching it with a stick to keep it going. You try to keep it from rolling away, or falling over. 

So it's weird but he tries it. Not easy. Never had one as a kid. Feels silly, but it makes him feel good. Every morning when he gets to work he leaves the hoop in a garage near his office. The routine produces great results! Roll the hoop there, roll it back, never misses a day. 

Then one evening after work he goes to the garage to pick up his hoop, and...it's gone. He throws a fit. WHERE IS IT? WHAT WAS DONE WITH IT? And the garage guy, a new guy, admits that he didn't know what it was and he tossed it. YOU THREW IT AWAY? THAT WAS MY HOOP! Okay, okay -- we'll get you another hoop.

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra less. 
One day ""little"" sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. 
She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. 
Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. 
She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me."" 
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. 
When she reached the top she pulled off her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. 
I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. 
I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. 
Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping! 
With tears in his eyes, my future father-in-law hugged me and said, we are very happy that you have passed our little test.....we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.""

Always keep your condoms in your car.........","My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me. It was her beautiful younger sister.",217

When he gets there he is told resources are stretched thin and they have not rifles to spare him, although they still expect him to go on patrol. He goes straight to his captain and explains the situation, the captain hands him a broom and tells him if he sees any germans to point the broom handle at them and shout ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" to kill them. The recruit thinks this is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard but he has no choice so he agrees and heads out. While on patrol he comes across a German soldier. The German reaches for his rifle, so with no other option the recruit points his broom and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and to his surprise the German drops dead. When he arrives back he immediately thanks the captain.

A couple of weeks went by and our guy had become quite the crackshot, even having a telescopic sight fixed to his broom. One day he was scouting the enemy position from under some bushes when he bumps into a German crawling the other way, in the cramped space he barely manages to point his broom at the German in time, so he returns to his captain and demands a weapon for close quarters combat. The captain takes a piece of string out of his drawer and tells him to hit an enemy with it and shout ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"". This time he trusts the captain and sure enough it works great.

Another couple of weeks go by and our guy is a legend. He kills dozens of Germans with his broom and string and receives several awards. One day while on patrol in a forest he sees a crazy German soldier in the distance running towards him and shouting at the top of his voice. He is pretty confident in his abilities, takes careful aim and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" but the German keeps on coming. He aims again ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and again nothing. The German is getting really close so he takes out his string, but as he swings it out and shouts ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"" the German just runs straight into him, knocking him clear off his feet into a tree and breaking several bones. As he lies there dying the German slows down and comes back for a look. He finds our hero lying crushed on the ground asking how this happened. He laughs, turns around and runs off, resuming his shouts of ""TANK TANK TANKITY TANK"".

post,ds2sky,2qh72,jokes,false,1572976378,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ds2sky/red_car_day/,self.jokes,,"Red car day - in Honor of my Dad

My dad died 7 years ago. He was a worker in a factory in NYC during the by-gone, post-war era when times were good and jobs were plenty. The guys he worked with were all good friends over the years and enjoyed harmless pranks against one another to pass the time. This is one of his best stories which I told at his eulogy.

There was a new guy, Jim, who joined the crew the summer of ’74 who became an instant comrade. The jokesters of the crowd - my dad amongst them - decided after a month or 2 it was time for a prank.

It’s important to recall in those days there were no cell phones, computers, google, ezpass computerized toll collection, nothing. If you needed to go anywhere back then you needed physical directions “go a mile down the road and at the gas station make a left.” Even toll roads (bridges and such) had people manning them and if you dared speed through, there were dedicated patrol cars who would chase after you, get the toll and give you a ticket, right then and there.

They decided to invite him to the end of summer cookout traditionally given by Ben, one of the men at my dad’s job. Jim was told that Ben lived in a remote area where even a physical map wasn’t going to help nearing his house. 

“You’ve got to follow someone on the highway to get there because the exits get really tricky,” they told Jim. He asked my dad if he could follow him to the cookout. 

Dad: “Sure,” my dad said. “By the way, what color car do you have?” my dad asked rather matter of factly. 

Jim: “Well, red I guess. Why?” 

D: “You lucky SOB. The cookout is on the 19th, It’s red car day on the highway that day.”

J: “Red car day?! What the hell are you talking about?”

D: “What are you living under a rock? The highway has free toll days for red, black, yellow and blue cars on the 2nd, 14th, 19th and 22nd of every month during the summer.”

J: “I never heard of that. Why the hell do they do that?”

D: “When they were building this highway back in the 40s there were 4 deaths, and those 4 men are honored with free tolls on the days they died. 3 months out of the year they give people with red, black, yellow and blue cars (the color of the cars the men had) free tolls to honor the brave men who died building the very road you’re driving on.”

J: “Wow! That’s quite a story. I had no idea. I have to admit I don’t travel that road very but that is really very nice to honor them that way.”


So, Jim made arrangements to follow my dad (with me, my brother and mom in the car with him) on the 22nd of August. 

As we got onto the highway, my dad made sure to drive slow enough to not lose Jim and be absolutely certain Jim was right behind my dad as they approached the toll plaza. My dad rolled down the window to pay the toll saying to the clerk, “I’m paying for me and guy directly behind me.”

As my dad drive away slowly, Jim inched up not really sure what was going to happen. However, the toll booth clerk just waved her hand as if to say “go ahead” and Jim, a tad startled at first, hit the gas and went.

My dad giggled a bit, then made sure to keep driving slow enough to not lose Jim as they approached the second toll plaza. My dad said to the clerk, “This is for me and guy directly behind me.”

As my dad drive away slowly, you could see Jim was more confident but still cautious. However, as the toll booth clerk waved his hand “go ahead” Jim hit the gas, this time a smile crawling across his face. He gained up to my dad in no time.

The traffic was getting a bit thicker now and my dad used this traffic to partially lose Jim, but make sure he could still see him. Approaching the next toll plaza, my dad was in a different lane than Jim. My dad stopped and paid the toll while Jim sailed through the toll lane. You could hear the audible alarm of a toll-jumper, and the black-n-white police car in hot pursuit of Jim. 

My dad pulled away slowly from the toll catching up to Jim hearing him arguing with the cop, “Yeah, it’s red car day.”

The funniest part was hearing Jim tell his side of it at the BBQ. All the fellas chipped in to pay the fine. 

:-)",Red Car Day,18

The doctors said that he was the most beautiful baby they had ever seen. Strong, attentive, curious, and very happy/content. The man could not have been more proud.

A few years down the road, the boy was running and jumping and developing much faster than his peers at the same age. The man beamed with pride looking down at his little boy. On his third birthday, he won a race at his pre-school and the man was so proud he exclaimed to the boy: ""lets go to the toy store! whatever you want, I will buy for you""

The little boy was thrilled. Off to the toy store they went, and he chose to buy 100 pink ping pong balls. The man tried to persuade him towards some action figures, and a new soccer ball. But the boy wanted the ping pong balls, and so thats what he got. 

A few years down the road, the boy was graduating from his elementary school. Top of his class, straight A's. The pride of the school. He was the fastest, the smartest, and most well liked kid there. Again, the man was beaming with immense pride. He says to his son ""lets go buy you a gift! what do you want? anything you want! It is yours!"" 

The boy looks at his father and says ""you know what Dad, I've thought about it - and I would really like 100 pink ping pong balls"" - The man couldn't believe it. Of all the things that a young boy could possibly want, ping pong balls? It didn't make any sense! But of course, he acquiesced and purchased what his son wanted. 

High school rolls around, and things keep getting better for the young man.  Quarterback of the football team. Dating the most beautiful girl in school. Valedictorian. Owns and operates a small business and is a well respected member of the community. For his graduation present, his father goes all out. Party, gifts, and he poses to him a question: ""Son, I want to buy you a car for your graduation gift. Lets go to the dealership and pick out any car on the lot"" - his son replies ""wow, Dad. That is incredible. But instead, could you possibly get me 100 pink ping pong balls?"" 

Again, the man was floored. Here he was, offering to provide him with the car that would make any young man jealous - and he wants ping pong balls??? He asks his son, ""why?"" - and his son coolly replies: ""Dad, it's what I want"" - so sure enough, he goes on Amazon and has 100 pink ping pong balls delivered to the house. 

Fast forward. College graduation from Harvard Medical School. On his way to becoming a heart surgeon. With tears in his eyes after the ceremony the father looks at his son and says to him: ""Now? Now can I buy you something amazing? Please. It is all that I want to do."" The son replies ""You know what Dad? I could really use 100 pink ping pong balls"" - This time, the man knows that resistance is futile and orders the ping pong balls. Whatever, right? If it makes his boy happy, than that is all that matters.

A few years down the road, the young man and his high school sweetheart are planning the wedding of their dreams. He is a successful Heart Surgeon, top of his profession. As they are planning the wedding reception, the father says ""son, I am retired now, and you've given me so much to be proud of. Can I please buy you a house? A car? A vacation? Something? Tell me what you would like your wedding gift to be, and I will make it happen"" - The son replies ""well Dad, now that my wife and I are to be making decisions together - we talked about it. What we would like is 100 pink ping pong balls"" - I mean, what is the Man to do? He doesn't understand it, he has long since given up on asking why. He just knows that he is proud and he will do anything he can to make sure that his son is happy. 

At the wedding reception, a man bursts into the room and runs up to the young Groom. ""Sir, I need you to come with me. The President of the United States just collapsed with a triple bypass. You are the only man that can save his life!!""- So the Young Man leaves his wedding, and performs an exhausting surgery and saves the life of the President. A few months later, he is at the white house receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The highest civilian honor in the land. 

The young Man leans over to his father and the Father says: ""Son, I am so proud to be your Father"" - and the Son replies: ""Hey, howabout that sports car now?""

The old Man couldn't believe his ears. On the way home from Washington, they stopped at a Ferrari dealership and he says to his son ""pick any one you want"" - and the Son goes to town, picks the nicest Ferrari on the lot and says to the salesman ""This one"" - As they are out test driving it, an 18 wheeler runs a red light and smashes into them. They are rushed to a nearby hospital and a few days later, the Old Man learns that his Son's injuries are too many to sustain life. 

As he comes in to say his last words to his boy, he tells him how proud he is of him. How he's a good man, a good husband, a great son, and the pride and joy of his life. Then, he works up the courage and says ""there's just one thing I have to know. In every milestone of your life, I offered you the world, and all you ever wanted was 100 pink ping pong balls. Why? Why the car now? What was it all for? Please, tell me. I have to know"" 

The son motions for his father to come closer. He says ""Dad..."" and then he dies.",A man and his wife welcome a beautiful baby boy... (long),12

First, he has to get himself a tailor-made suit.

Second, he needs to pick her up in a limousine. 

Third, she wants a large bouquet of roses waiting for her in said limousine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Determined, the teenager starts with the first task and goes into town to find a tailor who can make him a suit. After a while, he sees a tailor that seems to be good and relatively cheap, theres only one problem: His shop is crowded so there is a long line of people waiting to commission him. Still, the teenager gets in line and waits until he can commission his suit. With that done, he decides to go and rent a car next. 

There is only one car rental in town, so naturally, that one is overcrowded. The teenager joins the line and waits for what feels like hours until he finally can rent the car his heart desires. This eats well into his meager finances, but he's still as determined as ever to make an impression on the girl. 

Lastly, the roses. Theres a florist in town who is known well outside the towns borders for his fantastic bouquets. They are pricey, but well worth the money and since he has already spend a fair dime, the teenager decides not to be a cheapskate now and go all out on this as well. Unfortunately, the florist is in high demand as always, so there is a line of people here as well, going out well into the street. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, everything is ready. Our teen has his suit, the limousine and a truly spectacular arrangement of roses, just as his crush wanted. She gladly gets into the car and they drive to the prom. 

Due to the streets being overcrowded, they arrive just a bit late, so they have to wait in line yet again. Thankfully, the teen and his crush have a lot to talk about, so time flies by as they wait. 

Finally inside, they decide to get some cake. The selection is truly great and naturally a lot of people want the cake, so the teen stands in line for a good half hour to get himself and his crush some cake. 

Now, his crush is also thirst and thus asks him to get something to drink as well. The teen agrees and comes back five minutes later with two glasses of punch. 

""That was quick"", the crush remarks.

The teen nods. ""Yeah. Theres no punchline.""",A teenager asks his crush out to prom,8

post,drwmdd,2qh72,jokes,false,1572944403,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/drwmdd/everyone_knows_dave/,self.jokes,,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""
""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.
""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.
At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""
His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone Knows Dave,211

The bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It is shiny and in absolute perfect condition. He immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years. “Well, it’s quite simple, really,” says the seller, “whenever the bike is outside and it’s going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain.” Saying so, he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, “I have to tell you something about my family before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don’t talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.”

“No problem,” he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation and leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word. So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her right there, in front of her parents. His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. “She’s got a great body,” he thinks. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her in every position right there on the dinner table. Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain. Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, “All right, that’s enough, I’ll do the fucking dishes.”",Joe wanted to buy a motorbike,50

As they are waiting in the office, the IRS agent looks over his paperwork and says,

“The reason for your audit is that you have a relatively lavish lifestyle, but not much income to justify it, can you tell me what you do for living?”

Gambler says “I am a professional gambler.”

“A gambler?” said the IRS agent with slightly puzzled and surprised look on his face.

“Yes, I make my money betting, would you like a demonstration?”

“Sure,” said the IRS agent “let’s have a demonstration”

“I will bet you $1,000 that I can bite my eye” said the gambler.

“OK, you have a bet” replied IRS agent with a smirk on his face. The gambler pops out his glass eye and bites it. IRS agent is shocked as he did not see that coming, and he did agree to a $1,000 bet in front of the gambler's attorney.

“All right, all right, this was not really fair” said the gambler. “I will give you a chance to win your money back. I will bet you another $1,000 that I can bite my other eye.”

The IRS agent looks over the guys paperwork and see that he is not legally blind and takes the bet. The gambler takes out his dentures and bites his other eye. The IRS agent is now visibly stressed for being on the hook for $2,000.

“I'll tell you what. Double or nothing, I will stand on the edge of your desk, close my eyes and piss into the garbage can on the other side of the room without spilling a drop, what do you say?”

IRS agent is a little perplexed, but does not see how that would be possible and takes the bet. The gambler stands on the agent's desk, unzip his pants, closes his eyes and pisses all over the agent's desk.

“YES!!!” exclaimed the IRS agent knowing he won the bet and does not own the gambler any money.

“Ahh, shiiiit” said the attorney.

“What’s the matter?” asked the IRS agent.

“Well, he bet me $20,000 that he will come to your office today, piss all over your desk, and you would be happy about it.”",A gambler gets a notice from IRS that he is being audited,53
