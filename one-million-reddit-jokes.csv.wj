He couldn't control himself when they entered her door,

The went to the bedroom and got undressed,    

He was in awe and began to caress.    
He climbed on top of her, that's where it starts.

He could craft the greatest of ballads, but no one would listen to them. They were too preoccupied with the two big-time poets in the neighboring castle. The poets called themselves ShakespeareA and ShakespeareB. Their work was terrible, but the common folk were so enticed with the original work of the real Shakespeare that the brand name just kept rolling. The two Shakes were so conceited that they even believed that they were actually Shakespeares, and built two identical Globes that they lived in. Dmitri was tired of their fookin shite. So he took a trip to the local assassin, a shady man who had a sweet tooth for bakery treats. The assassin was so corrupt that he'd kill a man for just a single scone. Dmitri hit it off with the assassin instantly, and they struck an emotional connection that still stands today. Dmitri's poetry about cake plucked at the assassins heart strings, so he offered to lower his price to half a scone per man killed. Dmitri smiled and agreed, and before you could say ""iambic pentameter"" the two Shakes were found mysteriously dead, a silver arrow embedded in each of their necks. After this, the common folk began to listen to Dmitri's poetry. They loved it! Dmitri enjoyed immense wealth, and he and the assassin lived in high luxury. One day a man went up to Dmitri, and asked how Shakespeare A and Shakespeare B had overshadowed him for so long. Dmitri simply answered, ""What can I say, *I killed two Bards with one scone!""*",The tale of Dmitri,1

The husband, noticing the excitement, proposes that his wife tease the poor fellow. The husband suggests she pucker her lips, wiggle her bottom, and play along.

She does, and the gorilla gets even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.

Two mathematicians go to a bar after a rigorous day of number crunching. After a few drinks, the first mathematician begins to lament the current state of the general public's mathematical knowledge.

""People just don't know their calculus anymore!""

""I don't think that's true,"" replies the second, "" I bet they know more than you think"".

""Let's make it a real bet then,"" says the first, "" I'll bet you $100.00 that if I ask *her* a simple question, she won't be able to answer at all""

The subject of the bet was to be a particularly ditzy looking young waitress.

""You're on"" 

Before the bet commences, the first runs to the restroom. In the interim, the second calls the waitress over and informs her of the nature of the bet, telling her he'll give her $10 if she answers his question with ""x cubed"".

""X  cubed,"" She repeats to herself, ""I think I can handle that"".

The first mathematician returns, ready to start the bet. They call the waitress back over and the second pretends not to know her, saying

""Excuse me miss, but I was hoping you could answer a simple question for me, what is the indefinite integral of 3x squared?""

""That's simple, it's x cubed!"" 

Dumbfounded, the first man admits defeat and hands over $100 to his friend. The waitress begins to walk away, but then quickly turns around.

""Hey, I forgot something,"" she exclaims, ""Plus an arbitrary constant C!""  ",Calculus Joke,20

To which Patty grabbed the priest by the collar, looked him in the eye and said, ""Blow that shit out already, we got feckin fourteen!""

Q. What's the difference between greeting a queen and greeting Bill Clinton?
A. You only have to get on one knee to greet the queen.

Bill and Hillary are now married 40 years. When they first got married, Bill said, ""I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it."" In all their 40 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 40th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her, and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $1,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why.
That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed and said ""I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much, and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box?""
Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.""
Hillary was shocked, but said, ""I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that a few times is not that bad considering the years.""
They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""Why do you have all that money in the box?""
Bill answered, ""Whenever the box filled with empty cans, I cashed them in.""

Bill takes the pills for a week but unfortunately, the red ring is still there after 7 days. He goes back to the doctor and tells him the pills didn't help. So the doctor prescribes another medication, capsules this time, and gives him the same instructions. Take them for a week, and come back if it's not improved.
He takes the capsules for a week, and damn, the red ring is still there! So he goes back to the doctor and asks,
""What next?""

Ms. Brooks had enough.  She took Harry to the principal's office. 


While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed. 

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. 


Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""


Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""


Harry: ""36.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""


Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?"" 


Harry: ""Pants.""

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.

And when I was very small he told me about this little restaurant that served THE best Bavarian cream pie. Apparently he went there every opportunity he had. He couldn't get enough of that Bavarian cream pie - it was absolutely unreal.

Well, a few years ago, my grandpa found out that he had a terminal illness, and only had a few months left to live. So, he booked a deluxe vacation cruise to Europe that would eventually take him to that little town in Germany with the famous Bavarian cream pie.

A few weeks into the cruise, the ship started slowly sinking off of the coast of Portugal. I don't know if you remember that, but it was all over the news at the time. Well the life raft that my grandpa was in also turned out to be slowly leaking. So he helped all of the people that were in his life raft onto another one, but he wouldn't get on himself because it was already so overloaded. So, my grandpa, and I'm not making this up. This was in the news. My grandpa, at 84 years old, swims for over a mile in the Atlantic Ocean to the coast of Portugal.

Water-logged and exhausted, he hitches a ride and gets dropped off about 100 miles outside his destination in Germany. Trying to cross a main highway, he gets clipped by the side mirror of a car, but not badly, and he manages to hitch another ride with some people headed for Germany.

Eventually he catches a bus and arrives in this little town in Germany that he remembered from his youth. He's thrilled to find the old restaurant that he'd loved so much 60 years ago, and he walks in and takes his usual seat at the table by the window. The waitress comes over and my grandpa says, (my grandpa spoke German fluently, by the way), he says, ""I know exactly what I want. You have no idea what I've had to go through to get here. I would love a nice big slice of your wonderful Bavarian cream pie.""

The chieftain has them bound and brought to the village square, where he announces their fate. ""For trespassing on our land,"" he says, ""you will all be sentenced to death! You will be killed, skinned, eaten, and have your hides tanned to make our war canoes with. However, because I am a just and merciful chieftain, I will allow you to choose the way you die."" 

They approach the Frenchman first, and ask him how he wants to die. ""I have lived many years on zis world,"" he says, ""and have loved for a long time. Now, I would like to go peacefully. Bring me herbs to put me to sleep, and herbs that will ensure that I will never wake up."" The cannibals go out to find the most toxic herbs on the island and give them to the Frenchman, who eats them and falls to sleep, never to wake up. He is skinned before the others, and his flesh is taken to be cooked, and his hide is taken to be tanned. 

Next, the Brit is approached. ""Your friend is dead, and you are next. Tell us, how would you like to die?"" 

The Brit, ever the dignified one, says ""I refuse to let down my honor, even in the face of certain death. Bring me a saber, and allow me to die in combat against the finest fighter amongst your number."" The cannibals find two swords, and get their most ferocious warrior. The Brit, not knowing more than a bit of fencing, gets his neck neatly slit during the fight. He dies instantly, and is taken to be skinned. His meat is cooked, and his hide is turned into a canoe. 

""At last, my American friend,"" the chieftain says, approaching the New Yorker, ""it is your turn to join your fellows. Tell me, how do you wish to die?"" 

The New Yorker grins, and says ""Bring me a fork."" 

The chieftain is confused, but motions for the tribe to produce a fork. When it is handed over to the New Yorker, he laughs and begins stabbing himself repeatedly with it, tearing apart every inch of his body with its prongs. Horrified, the chieftain yells ""Stop!

As the big day approached, they grew apprehensive. Each had a problem they had never before shared with anyone, not even each other. The groom- to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for advice. ""Father,"" he said, ""I am deeply concerned about the success of my marriage.""

His father replied, ""Don't you love this girl?""

""Oh yes, very much,"" he said, ""but you see, I have very smelly feet and I'm afraid that my fiancee will be put off by them.""

""No problem,"" said dad, ""all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible and always wear socks, even to bed.""

Well, to him this seemed a workable solution.

The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up with her mom. ""Mom,"" she said, ""When I wake up in the morning, my breath is truly awful.""

""Honey,"" her mother consoled, ""everyone has bad breath in the morning.""

""No, you don't understand. My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid that my fiancee will not want to sleep in the same room with me.""

Her mother said simply, ""Try this. In the morning, get straight out of bed and head for the kitchen to make breakfast. While the family is busy eating, move on to the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.""

""I shouldn't say good morning or anything?"" the daughter asked.

""Not a word,"" her mother affirmed.

""Well, it's certainly worth a try,"" she thought.

The loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well. That is, until about six months later.

Shortly before dawn one morning, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, she asks, ""What on earth are you doing?""

His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.
''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.""
Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:
""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.""",COMPUTER DIAGNOSIS,133

Sure enough, he heard, 'One for you, one for me, one for you, One for me...' He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. 

Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. 'Come here quick,' said the boy, 'you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!' The man said, 'Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.'

The old man whispered, 'Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord... Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything.

""A moth walks into a podiatrist' s office. When he gets into the exam room the doctor says: Hello moth, what can I do for you?""

The moth replies: ""Well doc, I'm incredibly depressed. I'm feel like my life is falling away from underneath me. I've work at the book bindery for Peter Ilynovich for 25 years. Not once in my career have I had a raise. I'm not even sure he knows my name. I have absolutely no passion for my job. I don't have any passion in my life at all for that matter. I lie awake at night, deeply troubled. When I turn to my sleeping wife, I do not even recognize her. She has not aged well. Where is the beautiful moth I married? My mind then turns to my daughter, Anastasia. She died in the great war. She was the only joy in my life, and now she is just a distant memory.""

He begins to weep.

I then think of my other child. I think of my son, Gregaro, and how I cannot look him in the eye, for if I do , I see the same cowardice that I see every time I look in the mirror at my pathetic reflection. I see the same cowardice that keeps me from taking the loaded pistol on my bedside table, cocking it, placing it against my temple, and pulling the trigger.""

The moth becomes even more morose. He continues:
.
""I feel like a spider... even though I am a moth... hanging from a single thread above an eternal inferno, burning white hot with shame and regret. I believe the only way out of this miserable existence is to take my own life.""

The podiatsist takes along hard look at the moth in silenc. After a moment he says:

""I am very sorry you are so deeply troubled, moth. But you need to see a Psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come to see me?""

The moth looks at the podiatrist and says:
""Well, the light was on.""",The Moth Joke (credit to Norm MacDonald),15

Quand une mariée sélectionne ses demoiselles d'honneur, elle le fait en fonction d'amitié et parfois des obligations familiales. Elle ne capte pas les demoiselles d'honneur basé sur comment bien ils vont chercher dans les photos de mariage. Certaines des filles peut ressembler aux mannequins et d'autres peuvent ressembler à la femme américaine moyenne - environ 5 pieds, 5 cm de haut et environ 165 livres. En conséquence, toutes les robes de demoiselle d'honneur pas travailleront.
Alors, comment décidez-vous?
   Regarder objectivement ceux que vous avez demandé de se tenir à côté de vous le jour de votre mariage. Du court au grand, comment vos demoiselles d'honneur se alignent? Est-il généralement un groupe de haut? Ou est-il un qui se démarque des autres? Est-il juste une jeune femme qui est en surpoids, ou y at-il un couple d'entre eux? Est-ce quelqu'un qui est enceinte - ou sera enceinte par jour de votre mariage?
  Il n'y a pas de bonne ou mauvaise réponse. Vous voulez juste choisir une robe afin que vos amis et votre famille peuvent se tenir fièrement à vos côtés - et vice versa. Mais vous voudrez peut-être prendre note de la façon dont ils se comparent et le contraste en tant que groupe. Ensuite, visitez le salon de la mariée ou visiter un site de salon de la mariée par vous-même et voir ce que les conseils professionnels peuvent offrir. L'essentiel est que vous ne voulez pas que quiconque gêné de porter la bonne Robe demoiselle d'honneur mi-longue que vous sélectionnez. Vous pouvez, avec un certain effort, en trouver un qui est approprié pour tout le monde.
