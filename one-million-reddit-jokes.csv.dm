The doctors tell the couple that there is a experimental procedure where they will attach a device with sensors to the husband and the wife and the husband can share the pain during delivery so that it’s not all burdened on the wife alone.

The husband is impressed and in order to help his wife, he agrees to it without a second thought. When the doctors attach the device and turn it on, the wife starts writhing in pain as she is still feeling 50% of it but the husband is calm. 

So he asks the doctors to transfer 75% of the pain to him and 25% to his wife as he does not feel anything at all. The doctors reluctantly agree. 

The wife is still in agony with all the pressure and the pain while the husband is calm although he is worried for his wife. So he asks the doctors to transfer all of the pain to him saying he could take it. 

The doctors advice against it because male anatomy is not designed to withstand such huge amounts of excruciating pain and there is a chance of death. The husband does not listen and says that he can take all of it. 
The doctors give in and transfer all the pain to the husband. 
The baby is delivered without any complications and the couple return home in a week. 

The next week, the husband is going out of a run in the morning and notices that there is a different milkman. He asks him what happened to the old guy.

The Dutch says: ""I would like to master a new language, can I bring a Spanish teacher?"". ESA recruits the best Spanish teacher trains them and sends them to the space with the others.

The French says: ""I love my wife and I can't live without her for ten years"". So ESA trains his wife and sends her to the space too.

The Turkish says: ""I'm a big smoker, I can't go on without cigarettes for ten years"". So ESA uses the cutting-edge technology to build a  smoking container in the space shuttle and fills it with enough cigarettes for ten years.

10 years pass, the mission is successful and the space shuttle returns home. ESA organizes a crowded ceremony for the landing. 

First, the Dutch steps off and says ""¡Hola!"" with the perfect Spanish accent. Everyone applauds the astronaut's double achievement.

Then, the French and his wife step off, followed by two little children. The crowd applauds like crazy, they had two kids in space!

Finally the Turkish steps off with a cigarette in his mouth, shaking and visibly traumatized. He says: ""Does anyone have a lighter?""","The European Space Agency (ESA) recruits one Dutch, one French and one Turkish astronaut for a space mission",6

But what the bear didn't know was, on a nearby hill there was a hunter eating a sandwich watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly thinking, if that fly drops 6 inches, that fish jumps up and gets it, that bear gets that fish, i'm gonna drop my sandwich, get my rifle, shoot that bear and have myself a really nice meal.

But what the hunter didn't know was, just besides him was a mouse watching the hunter's sandwich, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly thinking, if that fly drops 6 inches, that fish jumps up and gets the fly, that bear gets that fish, that hunter drops down his sandwich and shoots the bear, i'm gonna jump on that sandwich and have my self a really nice meal.

But what the mouse didn't know was, in the bush behind him was a cat watching the mouse watching the hunter's sandwich, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly thinking, if that fly drops 6 inches that fish jumps up and gets the fly, that bear gets that fish, that hunter drops down his sandwich and shoots the bear, that mouse jumps on that sandwich, i'm gonna jump on that mouse and have myself a really nice meal.

Then in all of a sudden the fly drops 6 inches, and the fish gets the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter shoots the bear, the mouse gets the sandwich, but then it all goes wrong. the cat misses the mouse, and falls into the river.

And well, i think that says somthing about life. If a fly drops 6 inches a pussy gets wet.",Once in a forrest there was a river...,1

He is nervous doing his first procedure, but it is a success and the family is happy.  After they leave, he notices the baby foreskin lying at the side of the table.  First he goes to throw it in the trash, but something causes him to pause.  He thinks to himself- 'there must be something I can do with this'.  He can't think of anything so he ends up throwing it away.

He provides a few more circumcisions, each time he has a feeling that he should find a use for the foreskin.  Nothing comes to his mind, but he eventually decides to hold onto them so he starts storing the foreskins in a formaldehyde jar.  

Eventually he stops thinking about it, and just gets in the habit of storing the foreskins in a jar.  Many years go by, and one jar turns into two and then three.  

Right around the time the third jar is getting full, Micah is ready to retire. As he considers the end to his career, he is once again bothered by the great unanswered question in his career- what can he do with the foreskins?  In the final weeks before he ends his practice, he is bothered by the fact that his career went by without him ever solving this problem.  He becomes anxious that this might be left unresolved.

One morning he is praying when an idea comes to him- he should seek advice from an expert.  One of the members of his synagog is a taxidermist so Micah asks him if he can think of anything to do with the three jars of foreskins.  The taxidermist say ""absolutely!  drop them off at my shop on Monday and I will have something for you in a couple of weeks"".  

Micah drops off the three jars of Foreskins on Monday morning, and as soon as they leave his possession, he gets a very bad feeling.  The anxiety he experiences previously is now ten times worse- the answer to his life's unresolved question is now in the hands of a stranger, and Micah can't sleep at all.  

Two weeks go by and Micah is an absolute wreck.  He has barely slept, his appetite is gone, he hasn't left the house- let alone bathed.  Finally the morning comes for him to return to the taxidermist.

The taxidermist opens at 9 am, Micah is there at 7:15.  When the taxidermist arrives to open the shop, he finds Micah pacing back and forth in front of his store.  Micah stinks to high heaven and he clearly hasn't changed his clothes in 2 weeks.  The taxidermist lets him in the shop and Micah can barely contain himself!

""Did you come up with something?""  Micah almost shouts.  ""yes I did, and I think you will be really happy with it"" says the taxidermist.  The taxidermist reaches under the counter and pulls out......

A wallet.  Micah is confused- is that it?  Micah says to the taxidermist:  ""I don't understand.  I gave you three big jars full of foreskins, this seems a bit small?""  The taxidermist has a sly grin, and says ""Ah yes, I know its small.  But if you massage it, it turns into a suitcase""",The Mohel joke,0

Furthermore, the man has an orange for a head.

The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint, despite having an orange for a head.

The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man’s life.

“Excuse me,” says the bartender, “I can’t help but notice that you’re obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?”

So the man told his story.

“A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.

“For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said ‘It is done!’ and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.

“For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.

“For my third wish — and, this is the bit where I kinda fucked up — I asked for an orange for a head.”

Edit: There seems to be some genuine confusion here, but that's all there is to it. The joke is that he asked for an orange for a head, and also that that's literally what it is, no twists or wordplay involved. Aka anti-joke. Sometimes life be like that.",A bartender is cleaning his bar one day when an unusual customer walks in.,0

Then after many moons, I got a notification on that post. With a surprise I read that comment. It was of a girl. That comment told me to search for that music on r/Jokes. I was amazed. Why on earth r/Jokes started giving OSTs and songs and music. I asked her for the reason.

Bartender: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

Guy: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

Guy comes in again the following week gets his drink and the monkey takes off. He goes down the bar eating all the lemons, limes but freezes when gets to the cherries. He picks one up shoves it up his ass, pulls it out then eats it.

But what the fly didn't know is that there was a fish looking at the fly, and the fish thought to himself. That fly drops down six inches I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.

But what the fish didn't know was that there was a bear looking at fish, looking at the fly. So the bear thought to himself that fly drops down six inches, the fish eats the fly I eat the fish, I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.


But what the bear didn't know was that there was a marksman having a sandwich. The marksman noticed the bear looking at fish looking at the fly. So the marksman thinks to himself, that fly drops down six inches, that fish eats the fly, the bear eats the fish, I shoot the bear, I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.

But what the marksman didn't know was that there was a mouse looking at the marksman eating his sandwich. The mouse also noticed he was looking at the bear, looking at the fish looking at the fly. So the mouse thought to himself, that fly drops down six inches, the fish eats the fly, the bear eats the fish, the marksman drops his sandwich and shoots the bear, I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.

But what the mouse didn't know was that there was a cat looking at the mouse, looking at the marksman (and his sandwich) , looking at the bear looking at the fish looking at the fly. So the cat thought to himself that fly drops down six inches, the fish eats the fly, the bear eats the fish, the marksman shoots the bear and drops his sandwich, the mouse goes for the sandwich, and I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.


So it happens, the fly drops down six inches, the fish eats the fly, the bear eats the fish, the marksman shoots the bear and drops his sandwich, the mouse goes for the sandwich, but the cat fails and falls into the river.


There is a lesson to be learned here, that it doesn't matter where  you are or what you are doing. Whenever a fly drops down six inches a pussy is gonna end up getting wet.

Look, seeing that no one is looking, I'll expose one of my breasts 2 it &amp; see how horny it gets just as men do.'

Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.

'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'

Says Mark: 'Now expose both breasts and let us see what happens.'

The woman exposes both breasts to the gorilla and it gets very excited and is now desperately trying to escape from the enclosure.

Says Mark: 'This is incredible, now, pull your skirt up, turn around and expose your bum and let us see what happens!'

Voad: Well, I have taken part in many activities to pass the time. Through subtle influence, I have bought monarchs to the throne, and ended the span of tyrannical leaders. I have replaced chaos with order, and then installed chaos back in its place. But in recent years, I have taken great pleasure in the mundane. The every day. The boring. 

I: Please, tell me more about the recent years. 

V: I have taken my place in society, tried to give back to a world that has given me so much by fulfilling some tasks that others would not. I have rid the planet of a number of diseases by removing their carriers. I have stopped wars before they started. But most recently, it has been a more direct approach. Sweeping the streets, emptying bins. My current role has been the most surprising. 

I: And what are you doing currently that is so surprising?

V: Well, cleaning. It gives me great pleasure. Sweeping, dusting, mopping. All of it. I am enjoying this more than anything else I have done. And one aspect has been a massive surprise to me.

The winner would win $10,000. Vittore made his tacos and arranged them into a truly majestic Christmas tree shape with taco ornaments and a taco star on top. All that was left was to wait for the judges and camera crew to come by.

While he was waiting, a man dressed as The Grinch pointed at him and made a mad dash for his taco tree. But Vittore wasn't about to let anything happen to all of his hard work. He gave The Grinch a swift kick and got him away from the tree. The Grinch fell to the ground and scurried off. After another fifteen minutes, The Grinch put on a fake mustache and trench coat in the hopes of getting close enough to the three, but his The Grinch costume gave him away in an instant and Vittore scared him off.

Finally the time had come for the judges and camera crew to make their way to Vittore's tree. He was watching them intently but failed to notice the Grinch sneaking up to the tree. By the time Vittore noticed him, it was too late. The Grinch had grabbed a taco and stuffed it into his mouth. And even more unfortunately, he had grabbed a lode-bearing taco and the entire tree came crumbling down into a big taco heap.

The judges arrived just in time to see Vittore's ruined taco tree. One of them approached Vittore to inquire as to how this took place.

""What happened here? That's a real mess of tacos. I feel bad for you, son.""

""I've got 99 tacos cuz The Grinch ate one.""",Vittore Santos decided to enter a Christmastime food competition. Entrants were to make 100 tacos and arrange them in the shape of a Christmas Tree.,1

My husband’s home early!” “I can’t jump out the window, It’s raining out there!” “If my husband catches us in here, he’ll kill us both!” she replied. “He’s got a hot temper and a gun, so the rain is the least of your problems!” So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he ran down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovered he had run right into the middle of the town’s annual marathon, so he started running along beside the others, about 300 of them. Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tried to blend in as best he could. After a little while a small group of runners who had been watching him with some curiosity, jogged closer. “Do you always run in the nude?” one asked. “Oh yes!” he replied, gasping for air. “It feels so wonderfully free!” Another runner moved alongside him. “Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?” “Oh, yes” our friend answered breathlessly. “That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!” Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and queried,  “Do you always wear a condom when you run?” “Nope……… just when it’s raining",Nude marathon,22

So our man stands up to leave and falls  flat on his face. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air  and maybe that will sober him up.

Once outside he stands up but again falls flat on his face. He crawls home. Reaching the door he tries  to stand up, and yet again, falls flat on his face. He crawls through  the door and up the stairs. When he reaches his bed he summons the last  of his strength and tries one final time to stand.

It's  no use. He tumbles into bed and is soon sound asleep, only to awaken  the next morning to the sound of his wife standing over him shouting.

'So... you've been out drinking again!'

'How did you know?' he asks, his head hung in shame.

They keep walking and see an old house. The man says ""Look at that. Our first house. Do you remember?""

""Of course I do"", says the wife. ""We've spent such great moments in there. Looks so old now, I cannot believe how long it's been!""

They keep walking together, and stop in front of some very tall bushes. The man looks at his wife with a smile and says ""Remember when we were dating? This is where we used to have sex.""

His wife blushed, and responded, ""Yes, I do remember.""

The man starts getting affectionate and says ""So, what do you say we get behind those bushes, for old times sake?""

The wife, with a shy smile, answers, ""I don't know. At this age?""

The man insists ""It doesn't matter! Let's go, it will be fun!""

The wife finally agrees, they get behind the bushes, and, well, start doing it. Right in the middle of it, a police officer comes, points at them with his flashlight and says ""OK, you two, get out of there. What's going on here?""

They both rapidly get up, get from behind the bushes and the man says ""It's nothing officer, just enjoying something I used to do when I was young, you know, hope you let this one pass.""

The mother smiles and says, “Well honey, a man also goes through three phases in life too. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty, strong and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it becomes more like a birch – flexible but reliable. But after 50, it’s like a Christmas tree.”

Carl pulled over and was shocked to see that inside the box there was a baby giraffe. Carl leaned down and said “holy crap, how did you get here little buddy?”. To his astonishment, the giraffe looked up and said “howdy! my name is Jerry, I’m not sure how I got here”. Carl agreed that he would take Jerry home and try to figure out where he came from and give him a place to sleep for the night.

Carl and Jerry immediately took to each other. It was clear that Jerry has suffered some type of head injury and couldn’t remember anything before Carl picking him up.  Over the next few weeks, Carl helped nurse Jerry back to health, and after some deliberation, decided that he would adopt Jerry the giraffe and let him live on his farm with the other animals.

Years went by and Carl and Jerry became the best of friends. On Jerry’s 8th birthday, Carl asked Jerry what he would want to do on his birthday. Jerry decided that he had always wanted to go to the movies. Every time they had thought about going before, they declined going because of, you know, Jerrys large neck blocking everyone’s view. Carl agreed that they would get there early so they could sit in the last row and not disturb any of the other movie goers. 

Before going to the movie, Carl brought out a large sheet cake to celebrate Jerry’s birthday. Jerry, who was never allowed to have cake before, immediately ate the entire cake in three quick bites. Carl was bummed that he didn’t get any cake, but cut Jerry some slack because it was his birthday and he had never had cake before. At this point, Jerry had grown quite large and Carl also quickly realized that he should have gotten a bigger cake.

Off to the movies they went, Jerry sitting on a trailer towed behind Carl’s pickup truck.  Jerry had to crouch over completely to get through the front door, but just barely made it into the theater lobby. Once in the theater, Jerry got a sudden head rush from all of the sugar in the birthday cake, and began to get dizzy. He spun around several times, and flopped over the popcorn counter nearly crushing the server and breaking the glass candy display in the process. 

The manager of the theater came running out after hearing the commotion. The manager looked at Carl and pointing his finger directly at Jerry said, “Sir, does this animal belong to you?”

Carl responded: “Yes, sir. His name is Jerry and this is his first time at the movies”

The manager shook his head and looking over at Jerry said “you will have to pay for a new counter, and you can’t leave that lyin around here”.

Carl replied “Oh sir, that’s not a lyin, it’s a giraffe”",A farmer named Carl finds a baby giraffe,7

Looking at the ticket, we saw it was for a black suit that was brought to the cleaners in 1998; we both laughed and figured that the Dry Cleaners probably threw away his suit after going so long unclaimed, but I put the ticket in my pocket and continued organizing his bedroom.    
     
Later in the day I went for a drive into town for some lunch and happened to pass by the Dry Cleaners; so on a lark I decided to make a quick stop on the off chance they still had the suit, maybe we could bury him in it.     
     
I get to the front counter and ring the bell, but it took a long time, at least a few minutes for a very old man, older than my grandfather was, to shuffle his way to the counter.     
I hand him the ticket and ask him for my grandfather’s suit. The old man squinted and looked at the ticket, nodding. He looks up and tells me he’ll be right back. He slowly shuffles his way to the back.    
At least ten minutes goes by and he comes shuffling back to the counter, hands me the ticket back and says: “*Next Thursday.*”",My grandfather died yesterday.,11

    ""Your finest whiskey."" Says Jeff.
    ""That ain't cheap, are you sure?"" The barkeep replies.
    Jeff proudly exclaims, ""Absolutely, I'm celebrating tonight. Just asked my soon-to-be wife to marry me, and she said yes.""
    Nearby patrons congratulate him and Jeff begins talking to a man sitting next to him. The man is wearing a leather coat, and black jeans. He claims to be a regular and every time he comes to the bar he orders an appletini.
    Jeff questions the man, ""Why that? Why not a rum and coke or tequila?""
    ""Because, I like apples."" The man replies.
    ""Okay? I guess that's a good reason. Oh right, I never caught your name. Let me guess, you look like a Richard."" Jeff says.
    ""It's mike. My name is mike."" Mike says.
    Suddenly, Jeff gets a call on his phone, he answers. To his dismay, it's a telemarketer. Jeff asks for them not to call his number again and ends the call.
    Tim, another man sitting next to Jeff, introduces himself. ""Hey I'm Tim. Damn telemarketers, I tell ya. I got one that calls me every damn day trying to sell me t-""
    Before Tim can finish he's cut off by Mike, ""Shut the fuck up, no one gives a shit.""
    Stunned, Tim instinctively grabs Mike's arm and pulls him to the ground, for you see, Tim is a Navy Seal. The two brawl it out in the bar before the barkeep, who is wearing a brown shirt and shorts breaks up the fight and asks Mike to step outside.
    Mike reluctantly listens, ""Ah fuck this!"" He mumbles as he walks to the door.
    Tim leaves the bar soon after to go home and treat a gash he got on the side of his head from the fight. As he's walking home, he runs into a woman trying to get into her apartment, obviously struggling as she is carrying sever bags of what appear to be bananas.
    ""Woah! That's a lot of bananas!"" Tim laughs as he walks away.
    Back at the bar the barkeep decides that he's had enough of Mike and tells him that he is banned permanently from the bar.
    In a fit of rage, Mike pushes the bartender, knocking him off balance. He trips and slams his head on a window sill, cracking his head open.
    Mike, realizing what he had done, leaves the scene of the crime and dashed back home. 
Meanwhile, Tim, thinks to himself, ""Man! That sure was a lot of bananas! Haha!""
Jeff, not realizing what has happened to the bartender, tries to find someone to get another drink from. He looks around but there's nobody here! After looking for 10 minutes, he gives up and decides to head home to his new fiancee. Tim chuckles to himself thinking about those bananas.","A joke my wife told me, which I'll never forget",0

He’s working his dream job, he’s young, he doesn’t have a wife or kids, he’s looking forward to the adventure. The town he gets transferred to is beautiful. It looks like a Christmas card! The people are so nice and welcoming. He loves this town. He’s there for almost a year until one spring day, April 17 actually, he’s sitting in an adorable cafe, getting some work done, when all of a sudden a bunch of deer walk into the street! And I’m talking like LOTS of deer. He can’t see the sidewalk on the other side the street is so full of deer. The guy is amazed. He’s thinking “Omg this town is even better than I thought! Look at this!” And he turns around to share this moment with the other people in the cafe. He looks back and everyone is just standing up, putting their coats on, no one is really looking at the deer outside! Then he hears a bell ring from the church tower down the road. Everyone in the cafe and the surrounding shops walks out into the street, unzips their pants, and starts fucking the deer.

 This guy is now freaking out. He can’t believe what he is seeing but then just as quickly as it started, the bell rings again, everyone zips up their pants, and walks away. The people in the cafe just sit right back down like nothing happened! 

The guy is pretty disturbed but like, he really likes his job, he’s starting to make friends, he doesn’t want to seem out of place. So he decides, “You know what, I’m just going to act like everything is normal. Whatever.”

So another year goes by, it’s April 17th again. At this point the guy has convinced himself that it was all just some really vivid dream and he’s kind of forgotten about it. He’s in the grocery store and he hears the bell again. Everyone in the store leaves their shopping carts and walks outside. He runs after them and sure enough everyone’s fucking the deer again! At this point the guys like, “Ok. I’ve built a life here, I love it. I guess I just really don’t understand the culture. You know what. Next year I’m going to fuck a deer.”

So this guy waits all year in anticipation, just trying to build himself up for what he’s about to do. April 17, he stays home. Psyches himself up all morning. He hears the bell and he walks into the street, unzips his pants, and as soon as he starts everyone stops and looks at him with disgust. 

He’s horrified. He’s like “What?? I thought this is what you do! Every year! I just wanted fit in!”

The guy closest to him looks at him with a scowl and says “Well that’s the ugliest fucking deer I’ve ever seen.”",So this guy gets transferred to Norway through his job.,4

I have a warrant here to search your entire farm.""

At this the DEA agent becomes annoyed and pulls out the warrant: ""Sir this warrant allows me search this entire property, if you attempt to hinder my investigation, you will be put under arrest.""

The farmer, accepting defeat, replies: ""Ok fine, search all you want, I won't get in your way. Oh, but whatever you do, don't go into that far field over there.""

The DEA explodes with anger at this, gets right up in the farmer's face waving his warrant: ""I AM AN OFFICER OF THE LAW! THIS WARRANT GIVES ME THE POWER TO SEARCH EVERY INCH OF THIS FARM, AND THAT'S WHAT i'M GONNA DO. NOTHING CAN STOP ME!""

So the farmer gives up and lets the agent carry out his investigation. After some time the agent has searched almost all of the property and found nothing illegal. The only place left to search was the far field the farmer had warned him about. As the DEA agent is walking towards it, the old farmer chimes in again: ""Officer I am only saying this for your own good, do not go into that field.""

The DEA agent explodes again: ""I WON'T TELL YOU AGAIN OLD MAN. I HAVE A WARRANT AND I WILL GO WHERE I FUCKING WANT!""

The farmer is calm and just replies: ""Ok, don't say you weren't warned.""

So the DEA agent climbs the fence into the field. He searches around and again finds nothing. Determined not to be defeated, the agent walks to the very far end of the field in hopes of finding something. Seconds later the farmer sees him running back towards him in a massive panic, and the farmer knew exactly why. His massive bull Bruce lived in that field, and he was a grumpy old bull. The DEA agent shouts at the farmer: ""HELP! PLEASE HELP ME!""

The farmer shouts over to him: QUICKLY!, SHOW HIM YOUR WARRANT!""",The DEA search an old man's farm.,7

Well, I was walking home from the library, when a couple of college girls pull up, and ask me directions.  The directions were kinda complicated, and I was going that way, so they ended up giving me a ride.  They asked me if I was married, and whether I still had sex after all those years, things like this... next thing you know, I'm back at their apartment doing things I didn't think were possible between a man and two women.  We made passionate love all night, climaxing simultaneously.  You wouldn't believe how flexible and lithe they were.  Then they showed my their toy closet, and we did the dirtiest things the whole next day and through the night.  I've never been so consumed by lust and raw animal drive.  I still haven't been back home to see my wife.

That's some heavy shit, my son.  When was the last time you've been to confession?

His mother slapped him then screamed ""Don't do that that's very innapropriate. Go talk to yo' father and tell him what you did.""

So Elezekiel found his father working on their neighbour Robert's car. And Elezekiel told the story. Immediately after hearing it, his father stood up from working on the car, turned to Elezekiel, and beat him. After the violence was unhanded unto the boy, and his face was wrought with confusion and shame, the father told the boy to wash his face, go to his room, and think about what he'd done.

So Elezekiel washed his face, went to his room, and thunk.

Not daring to say no to the Supreme Leader, he agreed.

So the man assembled the best orchestra in all of Korea to play the piece he composed for the Leader. However when it was time to perform, the Orchestra was horrible, everything was off pitch and no one seemed to have any rhythm.

Displeased, Kim ordered for the man to be executed. When asked what his final meal was to be, the man replied ""I want a curry so spicy my eyes will melt."" The man ate the curry and began tearing up at how spicy it was, and it was time for him to be executed.

He was sat down in the chair and the switch was pulled. Sparks flew and smoke quickly filled the room, but the man appeared to be completely unharmed!

Surprised by this miracle, the Supreme Leader says ""Alright, I'll give you another chance to entertain me"" and the man quickly went to work composing another masterpiece.

Again he assembled the best orchestra in all of Korea and went before the Leader to perform, but this time the Orchestra performed even worse, by far the worst music to ever hit the Leader's ears.

So Kim Jong Un again orders for the man to be executed and again he was asked for what his final meal was to be. ""I want the Spiciest curry in all of Korea"" and the guards complied and gave the man the Spiciest curry he'd ever eaten, even spicier than the last.

The man was then sat down in the chair and the switch was pulled. Again Sparks flew and smoke filled the room, but again the man was completely fine!

""Alright,"" says the Supreme Leader, ""I will give you 1 last chance to impress me"" and the man went back to work. For a third time he assembled the best Orchestra in all of Korea and went to perform in front of the Leader.

But once again it was horrible, so bad in fact that Kim had to cover his ears to block it out. So once again the man was ordered to be put to death.

""Very well,"" said the man, ""For my final meal I wish for the Spiciest curry in the entire world.""

""No,"" said the Supreme Leader, ""I have had it with your magical curry, you will be put straight to death."" And so the man was strapped into the chair and this time the switch was pulled by none other than the Supreme Leader himself.

Sparks flew and smoke filled the room but the man still remained untouched! ""What?!?!"" exclaimed the Leader. ""But how, you didn't eat any curry.""

An elderly couple stands  at the counter at the local burger joint. The man orders a deluxe  burger, large fries, and a cup of decaf. The counter clerk turns to the  woman and asks her what she would like. 

“Oh, nothing for me, deary. My husband and I share everything.'” 

The clerk hits a key on the register and tells the couple that the cost of the meal is $4.98. 

The old man reaches into his pockets and pulls out a handful of  coins. Slowly and carefully, without a penny to spare, he counts out the  exact amount and hands it to the cashier.

A young man standing behind the couple watches this. As the clerk  assembles the couple’s order, he leans forward and says, “I’d be honored  to buy you another burger and fries.”

The old man turns to the young man and says, “Thank you, but my wife and I share everything.” 

The old man carries the tray of food to a table and they sit.  Carefully, he cuts the burger in half, divides the fries into two equal  portions, and passes half of the food to the woman. He sets the decaf in  the center of the table so they can both reach it. Then he begins to  eat.  

A few minutes later, the young man sits down at the table next to  them. As he gobbles down his food, he notices that, while the elderly  man eats, the woman is quietly sipping decaf. When he looks at her food,  he sees that she hasn’t eaten a single bite. Again, he leans toward the  couple and says, “I really would be honoured to buy you another meal.'”

The old man says, “No, thank you. We share everything,” and calmly resumes eating.

“I just hate to see you go hungry,” the young man laments to the woman.

“Oh, I’m not going hungry,” the old woman says. “I’m waiting for the teeth.”",Sharing...,11

(Background) My father was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) in his late 50's.  Watching him deteriorate was painful for me, but he always kept his sense of humor.  As he was nearing the end of his life, he was confined to a wheelchair with a brace to hold his head up, and had a feeding tube.  He could still talk, although it was very difficult to understand him.  Before he got sick, he loved to go to the casinos in southern California.  My mom wasn't as big a fan, so he would often go by himself.  One last tidbit about ALS - while all of your muscles atrophy, your libido remains in tact...

I stopped by my parents house after work one day, as I typically did, to check and see how dad was doing.  I asked what he did that day, expecting to get the typical, ""Nothing much."". But in his slurred speech, Dad said, ""Your mom took me to the casino!""

Knowing that wasn't something my mom would be super thrilled to do, I said, ""Really?  What's the special occasion?""

With a sly smile, my dad said, ""I told her she can take me to the casino, or we could have sex!""

""Once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me.""  
""Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans.""

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying:  
""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.""

Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard - but no Ark.""Noah!,"" He roared, ""I'm about to start the rain! Where is the Ark?""

""Forgive me, Lord,"" begged Noah, ""but things have changed.""  
""I needed a Building Permit.""  
""I've been arguing with the Boat Inspector about the need for a sprinkler system.""

""My homeowners association claim that I've violated the  
Neighborhood by-laws by building the Ark in my back yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the local Planning Committee for a decision.""

""Then the City Council and the Electricity Company demanded a shed load of money for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear none of it.""

""Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the Greater Spotted Barn Owl.""  
""I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!""

""When I started gathering the animals, PETA took me to court. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.""

""Then the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on Your proposed flood.""

""I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew.""

""The Immigration Dept. Is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work.""  
""The labor unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.""

""To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.""  
""So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark.""
