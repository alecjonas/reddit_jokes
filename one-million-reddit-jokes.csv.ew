Without checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the following note : 

""I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons but she wears short ones that are easier to remove. These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they are hardly soiled. I try yours on for me and she looked really smart. 

I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year ! I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.""

The bishop posted flyers all over Paris and the French countryside in the hopes that somebody, anybody could be half as good as Quasimodo was.  

At the end of the day after a long week of holding auditions for disappointment after disappointment, the Bishop is afraid no one will be able to ring the bells of Notre Dame the way Quasimodo could, but at that very moment, a man walked into the cathedral and announced that he would like to audition.  Immediately, the Bishop was taken aback, as this man very clearly had no arms.

The Bishop asked him- ""how do you plan to replace Quasimodo as bellringer if you have no arms?"" To which the man replied, ""I can show you I can do the job, if you'll only give me a chance.""

The Bishop was tired and ready to go home, but he decided to give the man a shot- after all, God works in mysterious ways, and if nothing else, watching this man attempt to ring the bells of Notre Dame would provide him with a little entertainment.  The pair climbed the bell tower, at which point the Bishop smugly gestured toward the dumbbell the man was to use.  

The man said, ""no no, I don't need that.  I'll get started."" And after stretching and warming up, the man began to hit his head on the bells of Notre Dame.  And the sounds he created with his head were more beautiful than the townspeople had heard since before Quasimodo had died.  

With tears in his eyes, the bishop ecstatically told the unknown man that he had passed with flying colors and could start whenever he wished.  The man, taken aback by his good fortune, was overcome, and fainted, at which point he fell out of the bell tower to the street below.  

By the time the Bishop made it to the street, the man was long dead and a crowd had begun to form around his body.  As the Bishop fought his way through the crowd, he realized that no one knew who the man was.  One of the townspeople asked the Bishop if he knew who this man was, to which he replied: ""I have no idea.

The first angel picks Mr. Percy Smith in London who walks into a bar the day before his one year sobriety anniversary. He says ""go!"" and the other angel starts slapping away. Much to their surprise, though, on just the fifth slap, Mr. Smith suddenly turns around and walks home.

Disappointed, the second angel looks around and chooses William Nguyen in Seoul, who has just sat down at a slot machine. The second angel says ""go!"", and the first starts slapping away. The second angel watches in agony while the first angel wails away, and Mr. Nguyen continues to throw away his money.

After an hour, they hear Mr. Nguyen whisper ""If I just get any payout, I'll stop.""

The second angel watches hopefully for a while, but begins to lose heart after another hour of solid losing.

In exasperation, the second angel, whose face has lost all feeling by now, yells ""Are you going to stop, already? You already beat me!""

The first angel says nothing, and continues slapping.

A chap goes to the doctor about his erection, and the kindly doctor prescribes him some Viagra. He explains to him that he needs to take it an hour before the act, so the next night the chap gets home early and prepares a romantic dinner for his wife.

He then calls her in the office where she works, about 45 minutes away from their home and, as she says she is just about to leave, he pops a blue pill, and waits.

After 60 minutes when she hasn’t arrived home, he calls her to see where she is.

She apologises and says “I was just about to leave when I bumped into Joe the CFO, and he desperately needed a report running for a meeting tomorrow morning, so I’m halfway through running it, and won’t be home for another couple of hours”

Our phallically challenged chap wonders what this means and telephones the doctor, who says:

“Look, the effect of the Viagra only lasts a couple of hours so it will have run out by the time she gets home, and I don’t want you taking another one with your heart. You might as well make good use of the one you’ve taken though – what about the au pair?”

After the race is over the two head back to Jeff’s place, along with a small crowd who overheard the conversation and want to watch more racing. Steve and Jeff set up a 10m (30ft) race track for the animals to sprint on. Jeff gets his dog, and Steve pulls a turtle out of his trench coat. 

One guy in the crowd acts as a referee, and when the signal goes off Steve throws his turtle like a football and wins the race. 

Jeff is pretty pissed, and bets 600$ that Steve’s turtle won’t win a 100m race. Steve agreed to the bet. This time Steve pulls out a custom-made potato gun from his trench coat and launches the turtle over the finish line.

Jeff is flabbergasted. He just lost 900$ to a smartass with a turtle. Then he gets a bright idea. This time the animals have to run four laps, 100m each way. Jeff bets 1800$ and Steve agrees.

Steve places the turtle down on the race track next to the dog. The ref says “go” and the turtle off. The turtle beats the dog by a whole 10 seconds. 

Everyone in the audience is astonished. That turtle can move fast! Everyone’s clamoring around Steve and asking him why he didn’t have the turtle run at top speed the first time. Steve smirks and replies: “I had to keep the con going somehow.”",Two guys are watching the Kentucky Derby.,12

Case in point, in 1989, a local billionaire spent millions of his own money to create a unique building of fantastic architecture, one that would draw people in for thousands of miles. He hired a small time architect to design the structure. 

After the buildings completion in 1994, it was revealed that the billionaire had tricked the architect, taking the design rights for his own and conning the designer out of millions. 

In 1997, only 3 years after its completion, the building mysteriously collapsed. Police were called in, witnesses were questioned, the works. No one had a cause, and the leads were few and far between. Perhaps the billionaire, who had taken out an insurance policy, caused the collapse. Maybe it was the architect, angered about his work being stolen. Even still perhaps it was simply a disgruntled employee. 

After countless weeks of debate, a man finally stepped forward. In front of thousands he called a press conference, claiming to have found the responsible party. 

""Was it the billionaire?"" One reporter questioned 

""Was it the architect?"" Another asked 

""Was it an employee?"" A policeman jumped in 

""No,"" The man said ""none of them were responsible""

Scared the man chooses Gumanji. The head of the tribe slams his spear and says ""Gumanji!"".

Several tribesmen sprint down and rip the mans clothes off, hold him down and have their way with him.

The next day, the second man faces the tribe and the leader says, death or Gumanji.

The man, having a wife and kids doesn't want to die. He unwillingly replies ""Gumanji"".

Again the head of the tribe slams his spear, ""Gumanji!"", and the men run over and rip the mans clothes off before having their way with him.

Finally, on day three the last man is on trial. He sits in front of the tribe and the head says ""Death or Gumanji"".

The man being wholesome in his masculinity replies, ""I would rather die than be raped by the men of your tribe"".

""I choose death!""

Huge collection built up over the past couple of decades: some Jaws posters, dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, the full set of Indiana Jones figurines, a few E.T. stuffed animals, and an original uniform cap worn by Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan.  It was getting ridiculous; I was one of those people who has a room full of this stuff, so I decided to sell it all.

This guy comes over to take a look.  A real middle-aged dork; unwashed hair, thick glasses, nasal voice, and food stains on his well-worn Star Wars t-shirt.  The sort of person I didn’t want to become.  He browses around and seems to like what he sees.

He picks up the Indiana Jones figurines, handling them carefully.  Some were still in their original boxes.  He made a noise I can only describe as “approving.”  Then the cap worn by Tom Hanks.

“How can you prove this is the actual hat he wore?” he asked.

“Look inside.  It’s signed by Tom.  “And,” I said, pulling out a thick folder of paperwork and photos, “Here’s a photo of him holding it on the set, and a certificate of authenticity signed by Spielberg himself.  Cost me nearly a grand.”

“Fair enough, ” he muttered. 

He moved on to the E.T. stuffed animals.  He picked up the largest – my favorite of the bunch – and gave it a good squeeze.

“Uh oh.  This doesn’t feel right,” he said.

“Excuse me?”

“It feels fake.  Are you trying to rip me off?”

“Of course not.  I have the paperwork for everything right here,” I replied, gesturing to the folder.  But he wasn’t convinced, and became a touch angry.

“I’ve completely wasted my time here.  You said everything was original.  This thing is obviously some cheap Chinese fake, not the U.S. version issued by Hasbro at the time the film was released.  And if this is fake, which it is, then I can’t trust that half this stuff is official merchandise either.”

And with that, he stomps off.  But before he slams the front door, he shouts back at me, “Mate, if you think that stuffed animal is original, you need a real E.T. check!”",Is this one original?,1

Back story the wife and I had mutually agreed upon getting snipped and scheduled an appt and all, I had invited her to watch because I wanted to let her know I was FOR SURE SNIPPED and also respect its a mutual decision even though some of reddit doesn't agree.   A few day before getting snipped she backed down and decided that maybe she wanted to have a another kid just not now! So respectfully I canceled the appt and told them to stand down.

So the wife and I are sitting on the couch tonight and we had been small talking reddit ""popular"" and I had told her about a post about parenting and that I had gotten snipped instead of canceling.  She laughed it off and we had continued talking about other posts on reddit.  Later the evening I told her again after crawling into bed, ""No.... I told you I had gotten snipped babe"".  (There had been no way that I could have been snipped!t The day I had scheduled the appt I had been with another employee for a 12 hr work day out of town and she had also driven by to make sure my truck as not at the doctors!)  I politely declined her statements that I was sterile. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, the deed was done and i did not want any more kids.  After all this is why Im not wearing anything anymore! We had both agreed many times that we were done!  This is why I had someone pick me up for a two work weeks because I cant drive or pick up the kids!  I told her that I had been continuing many days with someone driving me around and skipping the gym because of the cut between my nuts and anus!  She looked at me in despair and asked me if I was lying.  I rolled over in bed and pulled down my pants and said babe look see this fold between my nuts and anus.....  that's a scar!  That's where they snipped me! She bit hook line and sinker..... I lifted my legs high in the air and she whipped out her phone with the flash light only to discover there was a small bump/line of scar like tissue between the nuts and anus.  At this point I could hardly hold back between the joke going to far and my wife honestly pissed/crying.  I dropped the bomb and started laughing.  I had milked the joke so far that my wife had a flashlight on my anus.  For those wondering I never got snipped because I would never do that to my wife without her being there and witnessing it and she knows that also that which made the joke even better.

The boss asked him, ""Have you ever been a salesman before?""

""Yes, I was a salesman in the country"" said the lad.

The boss liked the cut of him and said, ""You can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you when we close up.""

The day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, ""How many sales did you make today?""

""One"" said the young salesman.

""Only one"" blurted the boss, ""Most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale worth?""

""Three hundred thousand, three hundred and thirty four dollars,"" said the young man.

""How did you manage that?"" asked the flabbergasted boss.

""Well"" said the salesman ""this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium one and a huge big one. I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast. I said he would probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the car department and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.""

The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?""

""No"" answered the salesman ""He came in to buy a box of Tampons for his wife and I said to him, You're weekend's shot, you may as well go fishing.""",The Salesman,21

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.     


Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.   

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.   

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.   

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,40
