Man: ""I got lost in the woods. I hadn't had anything to eat for two weeks. I was so hungry. Next thing I see is a Bald Eagle swooping down at the lake for some fish.

Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:
First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.

Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.
Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than any one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?
If we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct; leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night,

The lawyer asks if she would like to play a game. 

The blonde, who's tired and just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and says the game is easy and a lot of fun. 

He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa."" 

Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. 

The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."" 

This catches the blonde's attention; and figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, she agrees to the game.

The lawyer asks the first question: 

""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill, and hands it to the lawyer. ""Okay,"" says the lawyer, ""it's your turn.""

She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs but comes down with four legs?""

The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references--no answer. 

He taps into the airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress--no answer. 

Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500.

The blonde says ""Thank you"" and turns back to get some more sleep.

The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?""

Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.",Blonde finally wins,18

So a man is having terrible headaches.  These have been going on for years –and they just keep getting worse.  When the headaches strike the poor man can’t work, he can’t sleep, he can’t bare light or sounds or even touch.  The poor guy sees doctor after doctor and tries every therapy from yoga to prescription pain killers . . . nothing helps.  


Finally the man hears of special clinic in Switzerland.  He makes an appointment, flies to Switzerland, sees the doctor and gets examined up and down . . . they touch him, poke him, scan him . . . . they give him reflex tests and gagging tests and neurological tests and tests he has no idea what the purpose is.  Finally, the doctor comes to him and says, “We have good news and bad news.”  The man, thinking he must have a brain tumor or cancer responds, “Just tell me doc, what’s the bad news?  How long do I got?”    

“No, you don’t understand,” the doctor says, “we can cure your headaches.”  “You can!” the man exclaims, “that’s the best news in the world!!”  But the doctor goes on, “to cure you, we need to castrate you.”


The patient reflexively covers his genitals and says that he has to think about this.  He flies home, but it is no use.  The headaches are worse than ever.  He can’t eat, he can’t sleep – he can’t have sex.  Finally he calls the clinic and arranges for the procedure.  

The operation is a success.  The man recuperates in Switzerland for a few weeks and prepares to go home.  On his last day in the country he wanders into a small tailor shop and orders a custom suite to celebrate his new, pain free life.  The tailor, an old Jewish guy measures his waist and chest, his arms and neck and wrists, his inseam and his outseam, everything . . . finally, after all the measurements, the tailor asks, a little delicately, “Which way do you hang?”  “What?” the man asks, “What do you mean?”  

“Your testicles – do you let then hang on the left or the right?”    
“Oh, I had them surgically removed.”  
“I’m sorry, but before that, how did your tailor do your suites?”  
“One on either side,” the man replied.  
“Really!” Exclaimed the tailor, “You must have had terrible headaches”

After a while of staring at his already large collection, he thinks for a moment and suddenly gets and idea on how to increase it furthermore. So he calls up a painter and asks ""I want you to paint me a picture describing Custer's Last Thought.""

The painter thinks for a moment, and replies with ""Alright. I'll tell you when it's done.""

After a few days, the collector receives a phone call from the painter asking him to come to his gallery.

The collector drives over to the painter's gallery, and the painting is on display. The collector marvels at it for a bit, but is confused on the concept of it.

The painting had a small pool of water in the center of it, with a fish jumping out of it while wearing a halo. And around the pool, there were literally thousands of Native Americans engaged in sexual intercourse.

The collector marvels at it for a bit more and then asks what the concept of the painting was.

The painter replies ""Well the concept is quite simple. 'Holy mackerel that's a lot of fuckin' Indians.'""",Custer's Last Thought,5

Mind you, it's the day after Christmas and this isn't their first bar they've hit on their celebratory post-Christmas pub crawl so they're plenty toasted already.

Krumpus with his quick and piercing eyes spots the boy first and clops over on his hooves knowing that a boy of his age and with such rosy cheeks would fetch quite a large piece of gold if sold to the horny little Christmas elves who have always had a taste for youth. Plus the petite stature of little boys makes for better maneuverability with the impish elves.

Hearing the dreaded hoof clops though,  the boy scurried from his bar seat with fear in his eyes and then jumps right into santa's lap.

Santa with his cheeks reddened from almost a gallon of hard nog admonishes the conniving Krumpus. ""How dare you even begin to think of taking this handsome young boy Krumpus. This boy is special and too pure for your terrible plans."" The boy's bravery returns, but foolishly because he does not know of Santa's true intentions. You see dear St Nick never could completely quell the appetite he acquired from his years as a Catholic priest before he changed careers to his current role. You can still see the insatiable hunger in Santa's faded and bloodshot blue eyes as his breathing becomes heavier and pants grow tighter.

After witnessing the character of his companions, the Ghost of Christmas Present realizes the Ghost of Christmas Past wasn't exaggerating with his tales. So Christmas Past quickly dials Child protective services and then NPPD because it's 2015 and it's time to put an end to old dudes diddling little boys.","Santa, Krampus, and the Ghost of Christmas Present walk into a bar...",0

The bank officer tells him that the bank will need some form of security for the loan, so the Chinese hands over the keys to a new Ferrari parked on the street in front of the bank. He produces the title and everything
checks out.

The loan officer agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the
Chinese for using a $250,000 Ferrari as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Ferrari into the bank's underground
garage and parks it there.

Two weeks later, the Chinese returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.

The loan officer says, ""Sir, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multi-millionaire. What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow
$5,000?""

""Why, doesn't that just defeat the whole purpose?"" asked the King, and the magistrate promptly picked a pencil off his desk and inserted it into the hole.

They were all instructed to drop their pants, and the King made his rounds noticing that many were missing fingers as well as their most vital part.    
Then, he saw the quiet knight Sir Xavier, fingers and all still intact.

They take the scenic route through lonely farmlands. Not another soul in sight for miles, Trump enjoys the view and dozes off to sleep.

As luck would have it, his limo runs over a pig that suddenly ran across the road. The limo comes to a screeching halt, waking Trump. Both men get out of the limo to see the now flattened pig. Looking around, they see a farmhouse on the horizon. Assuming the pig's owner lives there, Trump tells his driver to go there and apologize to the owner. 

""Go to the farmhouse, tell them you're my driver, and that you killed the pig,"" Trump tells his driver. The driver nods and goes off to the farmhouse.

Trump tries to call for help on his phone, but the battery dies as he makes the call. Reluctantly, he decides to wait in the limo. Hours pass, and the driver finally returns to the later that night. Trump, furious, demands the driver explain himself.

""Well, boss. At first, when I told them what you told me to say, they couldn't believe their ears. They were shocked at first, but they started celebrating for some reason. The farmer gave me a mighty handshake, a strong pat on the back and offered me his finest home brewed beer. His wife whipped up a wonderful meal and even made a delicious apple pie. After all that, their beautiful daughter took me to her room and, uh, well...""

Trump, now more confused than angry, asked his driver. ""What the hell did you tell them?""

""Well, what you told me to tell them, boss: 'I'm Donald Trump's driver. I killed the pig'.""",Donald Trump and a Pig,2

Just to clarify, everyone in this story is, in fact, a moth.

Young Johnny Moth was taking a walk on a bright summer day. His parents constantly made fun of him and he always went up to his room and cried.

 So he was taking a walk through the streets and he saw a large sign that said in big letters, ""County Fair"".

He decides to go in and check it out; he has some money on him.
He walks around for a bit, and then he sees the Shirt Eating Contest.

He thought he might have a good shot at this; shirt eating has always been a hobby of his.

He signs up. It cost 5$. He sits down at a long table with about 10 seats. Each seat has a plate with 5 shirts neatly folded and stacked in front of it.

Everyone sits down and the director yells, ""3! 2! 1! Eat!"" and he shoots a blank. And Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else.

He's finished his fifth and last shirt before anyone else has finished their second. He starts running around and eating everyone else's shirts. And he wins!

Johhny takes his prize and leaves. Before he gets far, he gets a tap on the shoulder. It's the director. ""You did great back there. What's your name?"" he asks

""Uh... my name's Johnny Moth.""

""Well, I'd like you to participate in the Regional Shirt Eating Contest this Saturday right here. Are you interested?"" he asks Johnny.

""Oh... I suppose,"" Johnny replies.

""Great! I look forward to seeing you there."" And with that, the director leaves.

Johnny goes home and tells his parents what happened. They call him fat and Johnny goes up to his room and cries.

Soon it's time for the contest. He prepares himself and goes to the area. He's the first there, so he decides to take a short walk around.

Then he returns to his seat. Everyone else slowly comes in.

""Attention all contestants! There are two winners of this tournament. The winners are invited to the National Shirt Eating Contest on Thursday. The first two to finish their plate of 10 shirts wins! On your mark, get set, go!"" yells the director through a bullhorn, shooting a blank.

And Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else. He looks around. He's in the lead! He finishes way before everyone else.

He jumps around to everyone else's shirts after the second person wins. He eats a total of 48 shirts. He wins!

Everyone congratulates him and he runs home with his trophy. The Nationals! It's a very big deal, and he's very good at eating shirts.

He tells his parents, they punch him and he goes up to his room and cries. 

Thursday comes. His flight to Chicago is early in the morning.

He takes his bags and leaves for Chicago. He checks into his hotel and gets some rest before the big night. 

He wakes up and starts exploring the city. While walking, he bumps into a much larger moth than he. 

""Hey, watch it punk,"" says the moth.

""Oh... sorry,"" replies Johnny, continuing on his way.

""Hey, you're that Johnny Moth kid, right? The shirt guy?"" he asks.

""Um... yea,"" answers Johnny.

""My name is Freddy Mothinson, and I'm gonna kick your butt!""

""Oh..."" murmurs Johnny, who continues to walk.

So it's now time for the contest. Everyone goes into the hotel ballroom at the table where 8 people sit in a circle. 

""Welcome, champions, to the National Shirt Eating Contest! The two contestants to finish their 5 plates of 4 shirts will be invited to represent North America in the World Shirt Eating Contest. Ready, set, go!"" says the director, firing a blank.

And Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He appears to be finishing his shirts before everyone else.

He looks over at Freddy. Freddy is mass consuming the shirts. He's winning by a landslide. He hurries up on his shirts. He gets second place without any fight.

The director congratulates the two on their performance. 

""Hey, punk. Don't think you can stand a chance against me at the finals. I'm gonna kick your butt again!""

""Ah..."" replies Johnny, who walks to his hotel room to get a good night's sleep.

He returns home the next day, to tell his parents what had happened. His parents fart on him, and he goes up to his room to cry. 

He wakes up in the morning to find a letter on his doorstep.

""To: Johnny Moth. From: President Barack O'Motha.

A letter from the president! This was huge.

He opened it and started reading.

""Dear Mr. Moth. I saw your performances in Chicago on the television, and I was amazed at how determined you were eating those shirts. I will be coming to Paris to see you eat shirt in person. We're rooting for you! Barack O'Motha.""

He was very excited. Paris was in a week. He booked tickets, and went to sleep. He sleeps a lot.

Six days passed and it's time to go to Paris. He says goodbye to his parents who throw things at him but they miss and Johnny runs while crying.

He gets to the airport, and boards the plane. Luckily for him, he's upgraded to First Class for free! 

He takes his new seat, and finds out it is next to a very pretty lady.

""Uh... hello. I'm Johnny Moth. What's your name?"" he says with red cheeks.

""I'm Clara. Nice to meet you!"" she says, giggling.

They talk and flirt the entire plane ride, and Johnny finally gets the courage to ask her out.

""Um... do you want to have dinner on the Eiffel Tower at 7:30 after my contest?"" he asks while his cheeks have all his blood.

""Sure! I can't wait!"" she replies with a wink.

The plane lands and Johnny goes to his hotel for a good night's sleep. He wakes up, and it's his big day. 

He explores Paris for the day, until it's 6:45. The contest is at 7:00. He hurries over to the park where the event is being held.

He sits down with the 7 others.

""Bonsoir, monsieurs. Today, we are happy to hold the World Finals for Eating Shirt. Of the 8 contestants, only one of you will claim victory. You must eat your 30 shirts before anyone else. 3, 2, 1, go!"" says the director, firing a cannon.

Johnny and Freddy look at each other, and then dig in.

And Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. 

And Freddy starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else.

They're tied, but both ahead of everyone else. Johnny wants to win, he knows that O'Motha and Clara are watching. 

But Freddy is pulling ahead. He's ahead 17 shirts to 14. He's eating faster!

And then Johnny thinks of his parents. What will they do if he wins? Nothing. NOTHING! The hatred is flowing through him. He eats vigorously. He's eating a shirt every 3 seconds. 

He wins in a landslide.

He celebrates! He dances around, and Freddy slams his plates onto the floor and walks away.

The director congratulates him and the crowd cheers. O'Motha comes up and shakes his hand. He is given his award of 500,000 euros. 

He stays for a bit, and checks his watch. 7:24. He runs as fast as he can to the Eiffel Tower. He gets to the top by 7:30, and is out of breath.

But Clara isn't there.

She's probably just a bit late, he thought. 

He hangs around for about 10 minutes, but still no Clara.

He decides to look through the telescope to see the City of Love.

He sees a beautiful view. But then he looks into a restaurant. And what does he see?

He sees his lovely Clara having dinner with Freddy Mothinson.

He starts crying. He cries harder than he ever had before.

And boy, have you ever seen a moth bawl.  ^^^^^^sorry^^not^^sorry

wow thanks for the gold",It's a long one. Stick until the end.,213

Now, this particular eatery was a staple in quaint little Derbychesterfolkshireville, and everyone who was anyone ate there. You see, King's Dining Hall made a rather ostentatious claim, namely, that they only used the very best ingredients in their cuisine. And I do mean the *very best*. So very best, in fact, that anyone who thought otherwise was to be given not only a full refund, but an extra £50 000 as well. Obviously, such a claim was just *begging* to be disproved, and so multitudes of patrons attempted to do just that. Alas, to both their chagrin and satisfaction, not a one could.

Now, it so happened that, one day, a portly, sweaty, greasy, yet well-dressed man came into the restaurant, came up to Josiah, and asked, ""Excuse me, but could you please get for me the owner of this establishment? I wish to speak to him."" To which he replied, ""That would be me, sir.""

""You must be joking!""

""Yes, that's right.""

The man was puzzled at first, but because this isn't an Abbot and Costello routine, he realized the discrepancy and continued: ""My name is Phil Popper, the world-famous gourmand!""

""Huh. This is my first time hearing of you.""

""… Anyway, I understand your restaurant has a–""

""That's right, very best ingredients, or a full refund plus £50 000.""

""Well, I've come to test that! Not only can I determine the quality of your food, but also *exactly* whence it came!""

""Brilliant! Let's get you a table, shall we?""

In due course, Josiah led Popper to his seat and gave him a menu. King asked, ""Alright, what'll ya have?""

""Let's see,"" Phil mused, ""I'll have the rabbit stew… and the London broil with mashed potatoes.""

""And to drink?""

""Just water.""

""Thank you, sir. Your food will be out shortly."" And with that, Joe gave the order to his head chef.

""Mon Dieu!"" the chef cried.

""What is it?""

""Zere is no more rabbit! We just used ze last of it!""

""Oh, bollocks!"" Josiah groaned, his face buried in his hands. ""Please, Pierre! You have to do something!""

""Oui, monsieur! I will do all I can to remedy zis situation!""

""Thank you, Pierre,"" King sighed.

Immediately, Joe brought a glass of water to Phil. After taking a sip, Popper proclaimed, ""Excellent! It's from Leaf Spring, just outside of Newcastle.""

Aghast, King confirmed, ""Why, yes! That's right.""

Just then, Pierre quickly brought out the London broil and mashed potatoes and ran back into the kitchen. ""What about the rabbit stew?"" Phil inquired.

""Terribly sorry, sir,"" Joe said, ""The stew is, eh, taking a bit longer than we anticipated. We'll have it to you soon enough!""

Popper was suspicious, but he shrugged it off and began eating. After sampling both the meat and potatoes, his eyes lit up, and he chortled, ""This is spectacular! The beef is from a Jersey cow, raised on a farm in Manchester. The potatoes are a blend, half grown here in Derbychesterfolkshireville, and the other half from Otumwa, Iowa.""

""Tha-that's amazing!"" Joe gasped, ""How did you know?""

Phil touched his nose and winked. ""Don't you worry about that. I have my ways.""

At this point, Josiah was more anxious than a dog on his second visit to the vet. He slunk into the kitchen, when a beaming Pierre whispered to him, ""Not to worry, monsieur. I have got everysing taken care of."" Placing the stew on the table, Pierre announced, ""Here you go, monsieur Poppehr. I apologize for ze wait. Enjoy!""

At last, King could rest easy. Amidst the cool, ethereal bliss of relief under which Josiah lay, a familiar voice beckoned him…

^^""Joe.""

""Hello?"" he answered, eyes closed and mouth smiling.

^""Joe?""

""I am here.""

""*Joe!*""

He sprung awake and found Popper directly in front of him. ""That'll be £50 000, Mr. King.""

""B-but, I don't understand! What could possibly be wrong?""

""You said this was rabbit stew, did you not?""

""Y-yes, of course it is!""

""Then,"" Popper said, showing him the bowl, ""would you care to explain why *there is a hare in my soup?*""",This one's really long. Just sayin.,0

Each year, he invited a different friend to spend a week or two with him. 

One year, he decided to invite a friend from the Czech Republic. The two friends had an amazing time together, rising early and going hiking in the great outdoors. 

Early one morning, the lawyer and his Czech friend went out to pick berries for their breakfast. As they went around the berry patch, they came across two enormous bears-- a male and a female. 

Begley, seeing the two bears, immediately dashed for cover. His friend, though, wasn't as fleet afoot, and the male bear reached him and swallowed him whole. 

The lawyer ran back to his Mercedes and tore into town as fast as he could. He got the local sheriff, who grabbed his shotgun and dashed back to the berry patch with the lawyer. 

Sure enough, the bears were still there. 

""He's in that one!"" cried the lawyer, pointing to the male as visions of lawsuits from his friend's family danced in his head. He just had to save his friend.

The sheriff looked at the two bears, and without batting an eye, took careful aim and shot the female. 

""What'd ya do that for? I told you my friend was in the other!"" exclaimed the Begley.

The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used.  

It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room.  

In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another.  

In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door.  

In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit.  

Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off.  

A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful.  

Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance.  

The third friend spent a month in the bunker.  

30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked.  

Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack.  

With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried.  

**BOOM** The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust.  

The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""","Three young friends, seeking a fortune, adventure together to Egypt where a new pyramid has been discovered",8

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""  
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""  
The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know.  
""If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""  
The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.  
He says,"" I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth"".

I was working for a small company fabricating plastic tanks. One day when me and another guy were working , on an item, I  farted really loud. He said,"" I'm not going near you"", and went outside for air. Now for some reason it didn't stink and I hollered at him , ""Come back my farts don't stink!"" Of course he didn't believe me and when he came back in 5 minutes there was no smell and , he said as much. The trap was set! I told him that my farts don't stink and I would bet him $100! And I would let him be the Judge. He thought for about 10 seconds and said , ""OK it's a .bet"" , and we shook. I told him, ""I can't fart right now"", but when I felt one coming on I would call him over so he could sniff my butt when I was cutting one. We knocked off after that and went home for the day. The next day I got to work before he did and bet everyone in the shop $20 each that when I called M*** over he would sniff my ass as I farted.[$20 x 15= $300]. Well soon after M*** walked in and everyone went to work. About 15 minutes later I hollered over to M***, ""Get over here I'm about to cut one!"". He came over with the biggest grin on his face and, put his face close to my butt. I ripped a green monster and he said, ""All right! that's the worst smelling fart ever!"". The shop went quiet as everyone just looked at us and stared bug eyed. Then laughing, yelling, finger pointing- the whole shop fell apart. M*** looked at me with pure hate, I thought he was going to hit me. M*** went into the parking lot , I chased him down and gave him the $100. He said he was going home and to, kiss his ass. I went back into the shop, collected my $300 for a $200 profit and, went back to work. At break time I was fired-it was worth it.

As the crew became frantic, the captain bellowed to his First Mate, ""Bring me my red shirt!"". The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, which the captain put on and lead the crew to battle the pirate boarding party. Although some casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were repelled.

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain calm as ever bellowed, ""Bring me my red shirt!"". The battle was on, and once again the Captain and his crew repelled both boarding parties, although this time more casualties occurred.

Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's occurrences when an ensign looked to the Captain and asked, ""Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?"". The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, exhorted, ""If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid"". The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man.

As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to their Captain for his usual command. The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, ""Bring me my brown pants!!",Bring me my Red Shirt!,3

She spends $20,000 and feels pretty good about the results. After her recovery, she stops at a newsstand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, But how old do you think I am?’
‘About 32,’ the clerk replies.
‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.
The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’
The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops in a drug store on her way down the street. She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the clerk this burning question.
The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’
Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.
He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 81 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. Then, and only then, can I tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the best of her. She looks up and down the street and sees that no one else is in sight and finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’ He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay, enough already….How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are exactly 50 years old.’

""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I cheated on my wife of seven years."" 

Mother Superior looked at the chart, and right under 'adultery' was ""5 Our Fathers, 2 Hail Marys."" So she tells him, ""Perform five Our Fathers and two Hail Marys. Go and sin no more."" 

The next person was a woman. ""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I stole a purse from a store."" 

Mother Superior looks at the list, and reads what's there. ""Perform two Our Fathers and a Hail Mary. Go and sin no more."" 

At this point Mother Superior is feeling kind of confident. 

Another woman entered the confessional. ""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I gave a man I was unmarried to a blowjob."" 

Mother Superior checks the list. Blowjob... blowjob... Blowjobs weren't on the list. She tells the woman to wait a minute and leaves the confessional. She finds a passing altar boy and flags him down.

So the guy decides to try it out. He goes to the pharmacy and finds the machine. So he inserts his $10 and the urine sample, and after minute or so a paper pops out and says

&gt;&gt;You have tennis elbow. Soak your elbow in warm water for the next two weeks.

The guy believes this machine is a scam, so he decides to perform a little experiment. He went home and made a mixture of water, his dog's urine, his daughter's urine, and to top it off, he added his own semen.

So the next day he went back to the pharmacy, put $10 in the machine and inserted the concoction. Just as the last time, after about a minute a paper pops out that says:

When he wakes up and throws the covers back, he realized his wife is sleeping naked next to him. He decides, since he has some extra time, to wake her up with a pleasant surprise. He proceeds to go down on her, she enjoys it, everybody wins. 

Moments later when the deed is done he goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth and sees his one of his wife's pubic hair stuck between his two front teeth. He panics realizing that he must go to the dentist in an hour and doesn't want to look like a fool. He struggles to get the pubic hair out with floss so he gets a brilliant idea to grab the fingernail clippers and cut it down as much as possible. He is sure that the pubic hair is no longer distinguishable, and simply looks like a spec, he thinks to himself ""the dentist will have no idea."" 

So shortly thereafter, he arrives at the dentist office where they have him seated in the chair for cleaning. The dentist walks in and begins the cleaning, and after a moment he begins to laugh. The man asks the dentist ""What? what is so funny?"" 

The dentist asks the man ""You went down on your wife this morning, didn't you?"" 

The man panics and so sure he eliminated the evidence from his teeth he asks ""Why would you say this? that isn't a pubic hair in my
