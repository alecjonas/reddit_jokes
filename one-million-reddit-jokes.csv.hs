The two administrations met to discuss the issue, and after a lengthy process decided that they had to initiate one final fundamental event- the big bang- and that they would have to sacrifice one of their own to be the source of particles and energy. 

Nobody volunteered, so it was decided by vote that it had to be one of the two head administrators. The head of Antimatter High stood and said ""I'm sorry,  but it absolutely cannot be me.""

He called him names, laughed at his clothes, joked about his accent, ridiculed where he came from, made him look small and belittled him in front of his family, who all laughed until they cried along with everyone else at the man’s expense. The man wanted to retaliate but he didn’t know how.

Torn to pieces and disgraced by the sheer level of intellectual humor the man became broken and he left his family and roamed from bar to bar telling his story of woe. Eventually he met another disheveled traveller who suddenly became alive at his tale. The traveller said, ‘I know your pain but I can help you for I know a man who is the guru, the king, the true master, indeed the GOD of comebacks!’

The man said skeptically who is this person you know?

The traveller said he is known as, ‘Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee!’ 

The man said ‘who’?

The traveller said, ‘Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee!’ 

‘Okay’, said the man, ‘what must I do?’

The traveller said it would be a grueling task taking many years but that ultimately if he survive he to would become a true master of wit and repartee!

So the man set out to find Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee!

And after several years of great hardship he eventually did find, ‘Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee!’ 

At first Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee! Refused to help the man but the man persisted, he did menial chores for Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee! Until eventually, Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee! Did agree to help the man. 

Ono Bellono The Master of Wit and Repartee agreed to share his deepest humor his finest retorts indeed his greatest repartee!

After years of training the man returns to his home village astounded to see the same circus is returning and he knows his time has come to confront the clown with all his learned  and long mastered skill.

On the day of the circus he meditates on all he has learned.

He enters the circus tent and takes a seat. The show begins. ..

After some time, finally THE VERY SAME CLOWN returns! 

The clown turns to the audience and spots the man sat in the crowd and he points and grins.....but before the clown can utter a word....

The man, seeing his moment, springs to his feet and points at the clown.....all the crowd turn to the man and gasp! ....as he says,

His fingers found no hold, as his hand rolled over makeup bottles and brushes, slipping off and leaving him to fall. Down, down, down he went, till his head landed in the toilet bowl. With a sharp crack, his neck was broken over the edge of the porcelain thunder-pot. The man died instantly.

Three days later, a couple who had been friends with the man and his wife in highschool were in the middle of their evening meal when they heard about his tragic death.

They tried everything to get the pig larger, but he kept shitting the food right out.


One day, one of the brothers got the idea to stick a cork in its ass to hold the food in. Surprisingly enough it worked! The pig kept getting bigger and bigger, until it was the size of a house!


It took a semi to get the pig to the fair, but they got it there and won the blue ribbon. The fact that transporting the pig there and back cost more than the prize money is beside the fact.


When they got the pig home they were faced with a dilemma; what do you do with a pig the size of a house? You can't kill it because it would take forever to dig a hole big enough to bury it. Well, one of the brothers had a bright idea.


They went out and bought a monkey and a ladder. For 2 weeks they trained the money to climb the ladder and pull a cork out of a bottle by giving him a banana if he did. Finally when they thought he was ready they set the ladder up next to the pig


The brothers watched as the monkey climbed up the ladder, looked around hesitantly, then grabbed the cork. Everything went black.


Sometime later the brothers wake up in the hospital. A doctor leaned over the first brother and said, ""son, you've been in a coma for the last month. Can you remember the last thing that happened?""

&amp;#x200B;

A handsome prince from a wealthy kingdom is looking for a wife. Three princesses from neighboring kingdoms answered the call. They were gathered and told that in order to win the prince's heart, they'd each have to go on an adventure to seek and then return with seven of the best fruits of its kind. So off the princesses went.

The first princess returned with seven of the best ripe bananas she could find and offered it to the prince. But there was a surprise twist. She had to stick all of the bananas into her vagina without making a single sound. If she would so much as let out a whimper, the guards would decapitate her. So one by one, she inserted the bananas into her vagina. She was impressive. She was able to stick all six in without making a sound. But the seventh one was her undoing. Halfway through it she let out a small cry. She was beheaded.

The second princess was sly. She actually stuck around and witnessed what the first princess had to go through. So off she went then came back with seven of the best grapes she could find. So one by one, she popped in the grapes inside her. It was just like nothing at all. She was so confident she would win that she let her guard down. As she popped in the last grape, she laughed out loud. She was beheaded.

The first and second princesses meet in heaven. They exchanged pleasantries and decided to catch up.

The second princess told the first that she'd been wise enough to investigate beforehand what the fruits would be for, so she brought in grapes. Puzzled, the first princess asked how come the second princess was beheaded anyway. Did she make a sound of sorts? They were only grapes, for Chrissakes, she could probably take in up to fifty of them.

""Well,"" the second princess confessed. ""As I was taking in my last and final grape... I saw the third princess walking in. She was carrying seven of the world's best and largest pineapples.""

On their way to get married, a young Catholic couple were involved in a fatal car accident. The couple found themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.

While waiting they began to wonder; Could they possibly get married in Heaven?

When St. Peter arrived they asked him if they could get married in Heaven.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he left.

The couple sat and waited for an answer ... for a couple of months.

While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all?

What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?

Another month passed. St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.

“Yes,' he informed the couple, 'You can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple. 'But we were just wondering; what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard on the ground.

'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

He searched the local ads and found a farmer willing to relinquish some livestock for a fee.

He promptly goes to the farmers home and begins his inquiry.

First is the chicken coop and he finds the most beautiful rooster. He tells the farmer he'd like to take the rooster off his hands, and farmer gives him a peculiar stare.

""Listen son, if you're gonna live around here, you're gonna hafta learn the language. That there's called a Cock!""

Ok says the man and picks up the bewildered animal.

Thinking to himself, he decides the creature will be in need of some company. He looks the other chickens over and find a very plump, healthy hen.

""I would like to take that hen off your hands as well."" 
Again he's met with farmers disapproving glare.

""Son, if you're gonna live around here, you're gonna hafta learn our language. That there's called a Pullet!"" 

Ok says the man and picks up the hefty creature.

Feeling satisfied with his purchases, he decides to leave when he's met with a very pleasant donkey. So he asks the farmer, ""how much for the really nice..."" 

The farmer cuts him off saying, ""listen son, I know what you're gonna say, and you're wrong! You can have the beast, but from now on you call it an @ss!""

Ok says the man. He's walking away with the cock and the pullet under each arm, and holding the reigns for the @ss which is trailing behind, when suddenly the donkey comes to a complete stop and jolts the man.

The farmer upon seeing this runs out to meet them and says, ""Ah, this @ss gets real stubborn sometimes, but all you need to do is scratch him right here between the eyes, and he'll go wherever you lead him."" 

The farmer scratches the beast and on they go.

Sometime down the road, well away from the farmers house the donkey stops again. 

Helpless with the hen and the rooster under each arm, the man doesn't know what to do, when the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen drives up in an awesome convertible.

Upon seeing his troubles, she pulls over to the side of the road and asks him if he needs any assistance.

Thinking that she must be from the area, and not wanting to embarrass himself, remembering all the farmer told him, he thinks, ""I must speak the language""

So he responds to the lovely lady, ""Yes ma'am. Would you mind to hold ma Cock and Pullet, while I scratch my Ass!""",A man decided he was sick of city life and moved to the country.,9

All the rooms for rent are way out of her league. She's just a young student and she doesn't have that kind of money. Finally she sees an advert for a room that she thinks she can afford. It's way cheaper than anything else. Now, obviously at this point she thinks that there may be a catch, she's not completely stupid, so she decides to find out exactly what the deal is before she considers it.

She arranges to view the room, and she discovers that it's a room in a house where an old man and woman live. All their children have grown up and left home, so they have a room free.  She also discovers why it's so cheap; the house is so old it's never been renovated and it doesn't have a bathroom.

Well, she says, I'm not sure about this. I can use the outside toilet, that's not a problem, but I do like to keep clean, so I don't think I can manage without a bathroom. What do you do when you need a bath?

That's not a problem, says the old man, we simply pull out that bath over there in the corner, put it in front of the fire, fill it up with some hot water from the stove and then we have get nice and clean.

Now, you need to understand that this is a very small house. There is only one room, with a few armchairs, a fire, etc in it. This is fine if it's just the married couple, but obviously she doesn't fancy using this bath in front of them.

She points this out to them. She likes the room, and she loves the price, but the lack of any private bathing facilities is likely to be a deal breaker.

How about this, says the old lady? Every Monday and Thursday my husband goes out to play bowls. He has a few drinks with his buddies, he's there all night, after he has his dinner you won't see him again until midnight. It'll just be you and me in the house. I can fill up the bath with water, you can get washed, and you'll be finished long before he comes home. How about that?

Well, she thinks about this for a while, and finally agrees that this would be acceptable. So, she moves in.

The first bath night rolls around, and sure enough, the old man heads off to play bowls. The old lady heats up some water, they fill up the bath and the young lady has a bath. Everything is done long before the old man returns.

Later that night, the old man and the old woman are lying in bed, chatting. Did everything go ok, he asks? Yes dear, it went fine, she says. Mind you, she says, you'll never believe this...  
Believe what, says the old man.  
Well, she says, down below, she says. I've never seen anything like it.  
What do you mean?  
Well, I've heard of this, apparently a lot of the young women do it, but she has no hair at all!  
None at all, he asks her?  
None at all, she says.  
Now, the old guy is completely dumbfounded by this. He's not had the most exciting of lives, and he's completely lost for words.  
His wife eventually pipes up. You know, if you sneaked back about an hour early, you could stand outside the window if you were quiet. I could leave a little gap in the curtains, and I'll make sure that the bath is pointed towards the window. As long as you're careful, you could have a little peep.  
They both agree that they'll give this a go.

So, the next bowling night rolls around, and they eat dinner, and then the old man heads out. The young lady and the old lady heat up a few kettles of water, and then fill up the bath. The old lady makes sure to position the bath just right, and she leaves a little gap in the curtain.

The young lady takes her clothes off, and kneels in the bath, soaping herself up. The old lady is behind her, and she can see some movement outside the window. She thinks she'll give her old man a treat, so she points at the young lady's hoo-hah, then she slowly raises her own dress, and points at herself. Time has not been kind to her, so she figures she'll show her man how things used to be. She points to the young lady - smooth, lithe, well proportioned - then she points to her own body - old, wrinkly, saggy, hairy. She points at the young lady again, and then to herself. Young lady / old lady. Young lady / old lady.

Later on, the young lady finishes her bath, and heads off to bed, leaving the old lady alone in the front room. She hears a key in the door, and she knows her man is home. She figures he'll be pleased at the little treat he's had.

She's not prepared for what happens. He slams the door, and rushes into the room. He's got a face like an angry bulldog, and he's ranting and raving. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU PLAYING AT he screams at her. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU MAD? I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU DID!

Why are you so mad, she asks him? We've been married sixty years. You've seen it all before.

Yes ***I've*** seen it all before! The rest of the bowling team haven't, though!",There's this young lady looking for a place to stay.,5

She says, 'You must be new here. Let me explain. It's a rule here that if you get an erection, it implies you called for me.'

Smiling, she leads him to the side of the swimming pool, lies down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.

'No, what do you mean?' says the newcomer.

'You must be new,' says
the hairy man, 'it's a rule that if you fart, it implies that you called for me.' The huge man easily spins him around, bends him over a bench and has his way with him.

The man yells, 'Here's my membership card. You can have the key back and you can keep the £500 membership fee.'

'But, Sir,' she replies, 'you've only been here for a few hours. You haven't had the chance to see all our facilities.'

The lake was in a remote region of British Columbia, so they would have to fly in by seaplane.  
When they arrived, it was even more beautiful than they had imagined.  Not wanting to waste any time they started fly casting from the shore, but had no luck.  They did see a lot of big fish jumping out near the middle of the lake, though.  The problem was that there was no way to get out to the fish.  
So Larry took out his cell phone and saw that there was a faint signal.  He called the charter air service that had flown them in and made a request.
""We need two boats to be able to get out where the fish are.  Please send us a punt and a canoe as soon as possible.""
The next morning they awoke to the sound of an airplane landing on the lake.  Quickly dressing and hurrying to the lakeshore, they saw the plane drifting toward them.  Once it reached the shore, the door opened and...a young, scantily clad woman stepped out and chirped, ""Hello, boys!""
Mark and Larry just gaped.  Then the pilot emerged and said, ""Here she is, fellas...but what's a 'panoo'?""

It’s getting dark, and the road is twisty — so when he sees a sign “hotel and beer,” he decides to stop for the night.  Given that he’s lost, he figures he’ll stop in the bar for one drink and some directions.

When he gets there, it’s just him, the bartender, and a few drunks in a corner dealin’ stud.  College kid asks for a beer, but the bartender says:

“Naw, it’s jes you, me, and my cousins, son, tha revenoors ain’t gonna bother us.  Let’s have some ‘shine.”  

Well, the college kid had heard of moonshine, and was always curious about it, so he agreed.  The bartender got out an old milk jug and poured him a plastic cup of the good stuff, and boy did it burn going down.  It had a wonderful earthy flavor, mixed with what seemed to be antifreeze.  Lovely stuff.

After a minute, the bartender walked back over and refilled his cup.

“Hey, ya know what?  I designed and built this bar myself, ya know that?  Yep.  Me and my cousins got together and did it over a long weekend.  But do they call us the McEwin architects?  Naw, they don’t.”

“Alright,” thought the college kid as the second cup of moonshine started to hit him in the head.  He sat there for a minute savoring, when the bartender came and topped him up again.

D’ya see that sign when ya came on up in here?  Yep.  My cousins and me painted that sign, over a long weekend.  But do they call us the McEwin artists?  Naw, they sure don’t.”

Well, that seemed odd to the college kid, but by this point he was hitting that warm pleasantness where you can’t taste the liquor but you sure want more of it.  The bartender sidled back over and poured another big pour, and the college kid downed it in one.

“Ya like that ‘shine, sure ‘nuff.  It’s real good stuff.  Me and my cousins brewed that shine over a long weekend.  Sure did.  But do they call us the McEwin distillers?  Naw, they sure as shit do not.  

But ya rape a few college kids...”",A college kid is traveling through the mountains of Georgia...,13

The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping, the items got mixed up. The sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without checking the contents, he sealed the package and sent it to her with this note. 

Dearest Darling, 
This is a little gift to show my affection for you on our Anniversary. I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when you go out in the evenings. If it had not been for your younger sister, I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears the short ones that are easy to remove. These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me a pair that she had been wearing for three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had the sales girl try them on and she really looked great. I wish I could put them on you for the first time. No doubt other men's hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Be sure to keep them on when you clean them or they might shrink. I hope you will like them and wear them for me on Friday night. All my love, 

P.S. Just think of how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. Also, the latest style is to wear them folded down with the fur showing ","A young man wished to purchase a present for his sweetheart and after careful consideration, he decided on a pair of gloves",137

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?"" 
""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test."" 
""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance. 
""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?"" 
""No,"" the man said, ""Actually, I just heard about it."" 
""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?"" 
""No, on the contrary..."" 
""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?
The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. 
Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""
""No, not really.""
""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?"" 
The man was bewildered and ashamed. 
This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem. 

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife!!..",Don't repeat a rumour.,16

The man said, ""To get water.""

The farmer opened the door and gave the man a cup of water.

""Why don't you have water?"" he asked.

The good-natured farmer said, ""I do, but it has a problem.""

""What problem?"" asked the man.

The farmer replied, ""It's a Christian horse, sir. It only goes when you say 'Praise the Lord' and only stops once you say 'Amen.'""

The man said, ""Okay, I'll take it.""

So the farmer gave the man the reins to the horse.

""Giddy-up,"" said the man, but the horse did not move.

""Get going,"" he grumbled, but still the horse stood still.

The man kicked the horse with his spurs, but it refused to move.

Finally, the man remembered.

""Praise the Lord!"" he said, and the horse began moving.

""Praise the Lord!"" he said again, and the horse increased its speed.

""Praise the Lord!"" he said for a third time, and the horse entered full gallop.

The horse galloped on and on, seemingly without needing to stop.

""This is a great horse,"" thought the man. ""It doesn't need rest, nor food, nor water. It survives purely on faith.""

The man was thinking how wonderful it was that his old horse had run away and he had gotten this new horse when he noticed a cliff off in the distance.

""Stop!"" he shouted, yanking the reins.

The horse did not stop.

""Stop!"" he shouted again, and pulled the reins even harder. 

The horse didn't even slow its step.

Just as the man thought he was going to die, he remembered.

""Amen!"" he shouted, and the horse skidded to a stop just in front of the cliff.

The man peered over the cliff, and, thinking how lucky he was to have escaped death, raised his hands to God.

Little Susie is not the brightest child and never manages to stay awake. That day Susie wakes up to the teacher talking very intensely.
The teacher explains that the potential for an A+ on the assignment is within the grasp of any student but that realistically about half fail to pass the assignment. 

Fearfully she runs home after class is dismissed to ask her father what the difference is between realistically and potentially so that she can get an A+.

The father says she must do the work so that she can report it to the teacher because that’s how school works. 
He proceeds to send her with a question to her mother, brother, and sister.
“Ask each of our family members if they’d sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars.” 
“Um...okay,” replies little Susie.

First, she approaches her mother in the kitchen. She asked the question but is baffled by her mother’s response.
 “Would your father know? Hell, who cares, it’s not like he’s ever here! So...yea, and it doesn’t even have to be Brad Pitt. God! I just need to get some.”

The little girl stunned and confused runs up to her sisters room.

“Hey sis, would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?”
The sister yells back, “Hell yea, I’d sleep with any guy for that much....maybe even a thousand dollars.”
Astounded at the women in her life, she continues down the hall. Surely her brother will be more reasonable.

She heads into his room.

“Hey Jim, would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?”
After a very long pause Jim answers, 
“Yea...I mean...yea, definitely.”
“I’d probably do it for half that as long as I can buy whatever I want.”

Finally, Susie makes her way to her fathers study.

Her father sees her enter and inquires, “So...do you understand now?”

“I think so...,” replies Little Susie”
 
The next day Susie is called to read her report to the class. She recites the events, questions, and responses to the previous night.
“In conclusion, the difference between realistically and potentially can be drastically disappointing. For example, I came to the conclusion that, if we could get Brad Pitt or a look alike, me and my father were potentially sitting on $3 million dollars. Realistically though we were living with two sluts and a faggot.”","Little Susie, realistically and potentially",2

But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.

Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate.

""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

God shrugged and said, ""Jesus saves.""

Months go by and one night the man is listening to his daughter saying her prayers at bedtime - God bless mommy....she turns her head and looks straight at him - and goodbye daddy. What!? are you sure honey? She nods. The man's heart begins racing and he breaks out in a sweat. He is so upset, he can't sleep at all that night.  
The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office. He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.  
He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there. He watches the hours tick by. Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death. He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.  
His wife is up and waiting for him - Where the hell were you today??! He replies - Don't shout, I've had an absolutely miserable day.

""I'd like some raisin bread please,"" the man says.  
The shop assistant nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread located on the very top shelf. The man, standing almost directly beneath her, was provided with an excellent view, just as he had thought he would get.  
When she descends the ladder, he decides that he had better get two loaves. As the shop assistant retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what's going on and requests his own loaf of raisin bread.  
After many trips she is tired and irritated and begins to wonder, ""Why the unusual interest in the raisin bread?""  
Atop the ladder one more time, she looks down and glares at the men standing below. Then, she notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd. Thinking that she can save herself another trip, she yells at the elderly man, ""Is it raisin for you too?""

Reading his mum's thoughts, Dave volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Tina and I are just roommates.'' 

About a week later, Tina came to Dave saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver sugar bowl. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" 

""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure."" said Dave. 

So he sat down and wrote an email: 

*Dear Mum, I'm not saying that you ""DID"" take the sugar bowl from my house; I'm not saying that you ""DID NOT"" take it. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner. Love, Dave* 

Several days later, Dave received a response email from his mother which read:

The Leprachuan replies: ""are there any female nun leprechauns in any parrish in Ireland?""

The nun thinks for a second and says ""I don't know for sure but let me call the archdiocese and see what he knows.""

She goes inside and comes out after a bit.

""He says he doesn't have any listed at any parrish or church in all of Ireland.""

The Leprachuan thinks,""what about over in America?""

Nun responds ""let me call over there and see""

Comes back outside a bit later. ""The American archdiocese says they don't have any female nun leprechauns there either.""

The Leprachuan gets nervous and asks ""what about France?

""Germany?""

""No""

""England?""

""No.""

On Christmas Eve when Santa landed on the rooftop of Jessie’s house, Rudolph noticed a piece a paper and told Santa about it. Santa went to pick it up.
“Ho, ho, ho, it’s a letter addressed to me, might be a bit late now, but I’ll read it for the kicks.”
It read as follows:

   Dear Santa Claus,
I had fun this year bullying other people. This holiday season, I hope to take it a step further. Please give me coal so I can burn some houses down. 
-Jessie

“Darn it, what am I supposed to do now? This kid actually wants coal. Guess I’ll give him this high tech computer instead.”

When Jessie wakes up the next morning, he finds a present underneath his tree. He opens it up and there is a computer in it.
“See, Susie”, he says to his little sister, “it’s all about utilizing reverse psychology. You send him a note saying what you “want”, act however you want to, and still get an awesome present. I acted like a jerk and got a computer out of it!!”",How to trick Santa Claus,0

He practiced every minute of his spare time, but he knew that he wasn't yet first-rate and that there must be something he was doing wrong.

Sitting in a saloon one Saturday night, he recognized an elderly man seated at the bar who had the reputation of being a fast gun in his day.

The young gunslinger took a seat next to the old-timer, bought him a drink, and told him the story of his great ambition. ""Do you think you could give me some tips?"" he asked.

The old man looked him up and down and said, ""Well, how fast are you?""

The young man drew his pistol pretty quick and before anyone knew it, then shoots the hat off of the piano player's head!""

The old man looks over at the piano player and says to the young man, ""Well, that wasn't bad. But you're wearing your gun too high. You should have your holster lower on your leg so you can get to your gun quicker when you draw. And son, tie the holster down on your leg.""

The young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his Colt Peacemaker and shot the tie off the piano player.

""That's terrific!"" said the young gunslinger. ""Got any more tips for me?""

""Yup,"" said the old man. ""Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer hits it. That'll give you a smoother draw.""

""Will that make me faster?"" asked the younger man. ""You bet it will,"" said the old-timer.

The young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, then shot a cuff link off the piano player.

""Wow!"" said the young gunslinger. ""I'm learning' somethin' here. Got any more tips?""

The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. ""See that axle grease over there? Coat your gun with it. Just but the gun in it, layer it with grease! ""

The young man went over to the can and smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun.

""No,"" said the old-time, ""I mean smear it all over the gun, handle and all.""

""Will that make me a faster gunfighter?"" asked the young man.

""Probably not!"" said the old-timer, ""But when Doc Holliday gets done playing that song on the piano, that grease will make it hurt less when he shoves that gun up your ass!""",Is it the first line or the punchline that goes here?,1265

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says ""$101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

You’ve got a fucking massive orange for a head!”. The man, slightly upset, negotiates with the barkeep. “How about if I TELL you how I got an orange for a head, you give me a pint?”, to which the barman, after some consideration, agrees.

The guy says “right, I was at a car boot sale last week. I’m walking around and I spot this lovely crockery set. Part of the set was what I thought was a gravy boat with a lid. It had a couple of marks on it so I picked it up to rub them off and, before you know it, this fucking genie pops out. I couldn’t believe my eyes. The genie told me I had three wishes. So, I thought about it, then I said ‘for my first wish, whenever I put my hand into my pocket, I want to pull a £20 out’.”

The barman says “...well, did it work?”. The man reached into his pocket five times, each time pulling out a £20 note. “Jesus...it did work! So, what were your other two wishes?”

The man says “well, for my second wish, I said that any girl I find attractive, I want her to find me JUST as attractive as I find her. The genie told me my wish was granted. Watch.”, at which point the man ambles his way over to a girl at the bar and, within a minute, has her phone number.

“This is incredible”, says the astounded barman, “what was your third wish?”.

Nontheless, fear striken, he rolled down the window 

The flying head asked for a cigarette, and so the two men gave him one. He thanked the man and moved out of sight.

Moments later, the same old head came to the window, this time asking for a cigarette lighter. 

The two men were even more shocked and scared as the car was moving at 70mph. But nontheless, they still helped the head out in fear of what fate may fall upon them if they failed to comply.

A few moments later, the old man once again came to the window. The two men, now going at 100mph, proceeded to roll down the window again, to which the old man said:

Thanks to the miracle of science, however, his body was no longer needed, and his head was attached to a bionic system which made him stronger, faster, and he would live longer with it.

&amp;#x200B;

While he was in his hospital bed, recovering, his wife came in to talk about the changes that would be coming in their relationship. The relationship was strained, due to poor finances, and the kids costing so much, but her husbands new-found love for her was enough to spark everything again.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, when he made it home, he got out of the car with his new bionic body, and stood up. He walked to the door, and saw a note hanging from the door handle. He reached out with his bionic hand, more precise than any human could ever be, and read the letter.

Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist list the others.""

The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples.""

The king then explained the trial to him. ""You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten.""

The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.

The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy.

1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.

The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel-it was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!"" ""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""I know you didn't get to see the pope."" ""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me."" ""Really?"" asked the hairdresser. ""What'd he say?""
