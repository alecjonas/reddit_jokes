The M.C. stepped up to the mic.

“Bob, you have chosen American History as your final question. You know that if you correctly answer this question, you will walk away $5,000,000 dollars richer. Are you ready?”

Bob nodded with a cocky confidence-the crowd went nuts. 

He hadn’t missed a question all week.

“Bob, your question on American History is a two-part question. As you know, you may answer either part first. As a rule, the second half of the question is always easier. Which part would you like to take a stab at first?”

Bob was now becoming more noticeably nervous. 

He couldn’t believe it, but he was drawing a blank. 

American History was his easiest subject, but he played it safe. 

“I’ll try the easier part first.”

The M.C. nodded approvingly. “Here we go Bob. I will ask you the second half first, then the first half.”

So he goes to the bakery and walks in and says to the baker ""hey man can i get a dozen donuts, half glazed and half boston creme?"" And the baker's like ""No, you can't. We don't serve ducks here."" And the duck's all like ""man i got cash and i won't tell anyone just sell me some donuts and i'll be on my way."" And baker's like ""No way lil duckieboy, rules are rules, get outta my bakery before i call the cops."" 
So the duck walks outta the bakery super bummed and goes into an alley to vent and he's all like ""Man duck can't catch a damn break in this world, i make an honest living and can't even buy a damn pastry with my own hard-earned money, this shit is bogus,"" when he hears a spooky voice from the shadows say ""perhaps i can help you with that."" Duck's mad creeped out by strange voice in an alley but he's intrigued so he's like ""hey who said that show yourself!"" A second later a haggard old gypsy woman emerges from the shadows and says ""i've heard your predicament and have a solution to your problem. I have here a Magic Kelp which will transform you into an adult man so that you can see the world from a human's eyes, but the transformation only lasts for 5 minutes."" 
""Holy shit that's amazing!"" says the duck. ""How much does that Magic Kelp cost?!"" 
""For you, lil duckieboy, it's completely free."" 
Duck's ecstatic, can't believe the generosity of this gypsy woman. He eats the Magic Kelp and POOF turns into a middle aged man. He takes a second to think about the science behind that magic kelp but then remembers that he only has 5 minutes to be a person so he can't waste any time. 
He heads back into the bakery, walks up to the counter, and says to the baker ""Hey man can i get a dozen donuts, half glazed and half boston creme?"" Baker says ""yeah no sweat, funny you should order that though, a duck walked in here a minute ago and tried to order the exact same thing!"" The duck just wants his donuts but also wants to take advantage of his human form and mess with the guy a bit so he says, ""that's nuts! A duck in a bakery, how crazy. Did you sell him the donuts?"" 
Baker's like ""hellllll no i didn't sell that duck  no donuts, i do that and there'll be badgers ordering baguettes, cougars gettin cupcakes, and chimps buying eclairs. This is a bakery, not a damn wildlife reserve!"" ""Well, what if i told you I was a duck?"" said the duck. 
Baker: ""I'd say you're full of shit, i can clearly see that you're a man."" 
Duck: ""Alright, i'll bet you $2000 that i can prove i'm a duck in 30 seconds."" Baker feels like he's being tricked but knows the guy's a guy and not a duck so he agrees to the bet and shakes on it. Right after shaking hands the 5 minute Magic Kelp wears off and he's turned back into a duck, leaving the baker astonished. ""Hooooooly shit you're a duck! How is that even possible!? I don't believe my eyes!"" Baker opens up the register, takes out 2 grand cash and hands it to the duck who grabs his donuts and walks out like a boss.  
He goes back into the alley, finds the old gypsy woman, and hands her $1000 cash. Gypsy's shocked and super appreciative, ""Thank you so much! Most people just eat the thing and i never see them again, you're so sweet!"" 
And the duck says ""No thank YOU! I couldn't have donut without your kelp.""",So there's this duck...,52

''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying.

When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.

The round starts off well. He birdies the first 4 holes and is feeling great. Meanwhile he's starting to get annoyed by how awful she is. She's hacked up every shot and is ruining the course, his reputation and his concentration.  

They come up to his favorite hole, the par 3 5th. He tees up and takes a shot only to shank it wide right into the water hazard. ""You wanna hit another one, honey?"" She asks. ""I need to go drop up by the green. You hit first"" he booms. Pissed, he stands off to the side of the tee box while she slowly tees up her ball at the ladies tee and begins to line up her shot. She hits it and it's a beauty! It's tracking towards the hole and it goes right in! A hole in one!

He's devastated. He finishes up the hole with a par save and moves on to the next hole, the par 5 6th. 

They get to the tee and the wife asks why they aren't going to her tee first. ""Don't I get to hit the thingy first, honey?"" She asks. 

""Fine!"" He says as he takes her up to her tee box and drops her off. He heads back to his tee box 40 yards away and waits as she tees off first. She hits and dances a bit and then turns around to watch him hit.

He's really furious now. He tees up and can't help but think how much the guys in the clubhouse will never let him live this down. Obviously not focusing on his drive, he swings and makes terrible contact again. The ball takes off to the right and smashes his wife right in the forehead dropping her dead on the ladies tee box. 

The coroner finishes the autopsy has a brief conversation with the sheriff before they speak with the husband. 

They call him over and the Sheriff begins. ""So obviously it was the golf ball to the forehead that killed her. Seems like a cut and dry accident to the doctor and I, sir."" The Sheriff says. ""We did have one question, though, didn't we, doctor?""

""We did."" The doctor says as he walks around the autopsy table. We found the first ball in your wife's forehead. It's no doubt that this was the death blow, but it was the second ball that we found that sparked our curiosity.""

The husband is clearly distraught and starting to look scared.  

""The second ball was found embedded in the back of her thigh"" the Sheriff explains. ""What do you have to say about that, sir?""

The husband is shaking and sweating now. ""I promise you gentlemen it was not my intention to mislead anyone. Just please do me a favor"" the husband begs. 

""What's that?!"" The two men ask.

""Don't tell the guys I took a mulligan. They'll make me rip up that 71 I turned in.""

They loved each other and all, there was just one problem – the guy farted incredibly, and enjoyed ripping seriously loud ones in bed especially.

The wife complained for years, pleaded – in vain. “One day, you’ll spill your guts out, you mark my words!” was the lady’s frequent closing warning.

Then one Thanksgiving morning, gutting the turkey, she had a stroke of genius. She took all the turkey’s guts and went to their bedroom and quietly slipped them under the still sleeping man’s covers. “That’ll teach him!” she thought with satisfaction and went back to her work.
 
At 10 the man was still nowhere to be seen – quite shocking for a farmer – and she was starting to worry when finally her husband came down – walking a little strange, wearing an even stranger expression.

This boy was always detached from society year after year and practically was never able to have friends.

His mother always tried to make him feel normal. birthday after birthday this boy wished for nothing but friends.

When he was 18 , in a sunny summer day , his mother told him , "" son , today we will try something new"", "" i will take you to the beach by the ocean tomorrow morning  and i will leave you there alone to enjoy the day and make some friends.""


So the morning came and the son was excited. His mother lathered him in sunscreen  ,took him to the beach , threw a towel on the sand  and layed him there on it, like a soggy chicken nugget.

Hours passed and the son was actually enjoying himself. Reading a book on his kindle under his umbrella.


A young woman approached him , staring at him from the distance at first feeling sorry for him. she knelt down and asked him what he was doing there. He told her that his aim for the day was to make friends and maybe meet some one special. The girl felt she should make his day better and asked him 

"" Hey , so you have never seen a breast?"" . 

The boy was shocked and muttered ""no"". So the girl cupped her breast from her bikini and showed it to him. The boy was in heaven . He thanked and thanked her, the girl rubbed his cheek and said it was a pleasure , and left.

Now the boy was really enjoying his day , having seen a tit for his very first time. He just kept staring in the distance, forgetting all about his boring book. 

Another blonde woman , in her early 20s , who was passing by, couldn't help but notice him grinning and smirking all alone. she stopped close by and asked him what could have made him so happy. 

""I have seen a tit ! ""  ,   he exclaimed , ""I had never seen one, I am so happy!""

The woman smiled , and whispered , "" Nice , but have you ever sucked on one?""  .

"" No , of course not! "" he said.   

She proceeded in uncovering both her breasts and lowered herself on his face for a good minute.

""Jesus Christ"" , he said while trying to catch his breath in the middle of the cleavage  . 

""What is happening today! , it is the best day of my life""

She winked at him , and slowly walked away.


The boy was in euphoria. He could not believe what was happening to him. It was the best day of his life. In 100 years he would not have predicted what would happen if he went to the beach for just one day. He swore to himself he would come to the beach every day for the rest of his life.


Suddenly he saw a group of nice women running in his direction. He kept staring at them particularly at their jiggly breasts . Suddenly one of the girls , the best looking of them all, stopped and kneeled down by him , while her friends kept running.

"" hey YOU , have you ever been fucked?""


His heart stopped  , and full of confidence he yelled, "" NO , NO !  I have certainly never been fucked !""


And she said , while getting back up and regaining her pace,


   "" well , you are now ......... TSUNAMI!!!""

A little miffed at the price, I slowly took my card out ready to pay for my tickets and get on with my day. 

The worker however, pushed my hand back and said ""hold on sir, first we must run through all the extra addons"".

""Addons?"" I exclaimed, ""This is a film, and I'm paying $60, I just want to see the film and nothing else, no addons needed"". The worker cleared his throat ""With the new Star Wars, your ticket will allow you to see some of the film, some of the characters, however to see all of it, you must pay some additional fees"".

Outraged, I asked just how much more it would cost, just to see the whole film. The worker tapped away at his kiosk for a while, looked up at me, cleared his throat once again, and quietly said ""$2100 sir"". 


My mouth dropped open, ""What would ever justify me spending that much just to get a full film?""

""We feel paying additional costs to see the whole movie will provide you will a sense of pride and accomplishment"".

Husband: ""honey just give me the day I need to relieve some stress. Besides You don't even golf.""

Wife: ""I want to learn and besides it's something we can do together.""

The husband begrudgingly accepts his wife request they go to the gold course. On the first tee the husband drives it 300 yards, dead center. The wife tries it and slices it right into a huge window of a huge house on the side of the course. 

Husband says ""ah shit. Ok let's go pay for this window

The couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. A very well dressed man answers the door, ""Yeees..?"" 

Husband: ""Hi we're the ones that broke the window, are you the owner of the house?""

Well dressed man: ""oh no I am only the butler. Master is on the other room, follow me. 

The couple follows the butler through the massive entry and into a wondrous library. In the center of which sits the master, staying intently at a vase that was broken, quite clearly by the golf ball.

Husband: ""oh I am so sorry. My wife, you see, is learning golf. She didnt mean to..""

The master interrupts in an understanding tone ""haha oh its alright. You see I'm a genie and I was trapped in that case for the last several hundred years. But you released me by breaking it. As you know genies grant 3 wishes. But since you did break the window I will save the third for myself, leave 1 each for you both. Madame would you like to go first?""

Wife: ""uh I want lots of money....""

""Done."" Interrupts the master, "" I'll also make it theft proof, fire proof, and infinite. Anytime you need money no matter the amount, it will be in your account.""

Wife: ""oh my goodness thank you so much!""

""You're turn"", says the the master looking at the husband.

Husband: ""I'd like a beautiful home in ever country.""

Master: ""and you shall have it. Complete with protection from all the elements and a staff to maintain it and look after you when you stay.""

Husband: "" Jesus! thank you so much!""

Master: ""not a problem. As for my wish, well I have been trapped in that case for so long and all the while without a woman. I am sorry but my wish is to have sex with your beautiful wife.""

Husband to wife: ""I don't know honey. I mean he did give us all that money and houses. You know how I feel about cheating but this seems different.""

Wife: ""yeah I agree. I'm not thrilled about it but I get where he is coming from. Play well do it""

The Master is thrilled and wisks the wife upstairs where they have loud, wall banging sex for hours on end. Finally after all that time the master comes down in only his underwear and his unbuttoned dress shirt. He grabs a cup of water and drinks the whole thing. The master then asks the nearby husband, "" if you dont mind me asking how old are you ans your wife?""

Husband: "" well I'm 32 and she is 34, why do you ask?""

Master: ""just curious as to how you guys still believe in genies.....

Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension payment. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with, have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope… Can you please help me?
Sincerely, Edna The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends. Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.

It read: Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it might have been those bastards at the post office.

Their wives aren't, hence they have to sneak out now and then if they ever want ribs. That very evening after work they meet at an old tin shed barbecue stand outside of town, the best barbecue in the county. They’re laughing and slamming ribs down oblivious to the time. Suddenly one guy looks down at his watch and says, “Oh man! I was supposed to be home an hour ago. I gotta run or she’ll kill; me for real!” 
He washes up and takes off in his car going over 90 mph. A state cop is hiding in some trees and takes off after him. The guy puts on his best pity face and says ”Officer, I’m sorry, but my wife has some kinda cancer and they called me and said she’s slipping away now and she wants me by her side when she goes,” The cop’s heart melts and he says “Listen, go on, just don’t drive do crazy. Now go,”
 The guy drives on, laughing at the cop. 
The second guy looks down at his watch and says, “I’m dead; I was supposed to be home a long time ago. I‘m gonna get a skillet smashed over my head!” He washes up and takes off in his car going well over the speed limit. The same state cop is hiding again, sees him and takes off after him. The guy puts on a face and tells the cop that his wife is bleeding to death after falling through a plate glass window and wants to see him before she dies. The cop’s soft heart takes over again, and he says the guy can go, but adomishes him to obey the speed limit. The guy takes off, sniggering at the cop. 
The third guy is just a naturally crazy driver.  He finishes his umpteenth order of ribs, gets in the car, and drives like a madman down the same highway as the other two. The cop takes off after him vowing not to be a pushover this time. When they stop the cop walks up to the car, looks at the guy and says, “Wait, don’t tell me, I’ll tell you; it’s your wife, right? The driver gives the cop a funny stare, then looks at himself in the rearview mirror. He looks at the cop and says, “Oh no suh, that’s barbecue.”

As they were walking down the street the houses progressively got bigger and nicer.  Finally St. Peter points at this beautiful mansion and says ""for all your hard work and great achievements we have set this beautiful house set aside for you""

Trey turns to St Peter and says ""My house is wonderful, I've done a lot of great things too.  Jerry, shouldn't have a house that much better than mine""

Jim was sentenced to death, executed by an electric chair. When asked for a last meal, Jim simply replied: ""I will have one banana."" After finishing his banana, he was sent to the chair. However, it didn't work. The electric chair had no effect. 

Jim was set free by the police force, and got a job at another train station. He sped along the tracks, he simply could not contain his excitement! However, he was careless and crashed into another train.

Jim, imprisoned again, was sentenced to death, by the electric chair. ""What would you like for your final meal?"" the chief of police asked. Jim simply replied ""I would like two bananas."" He finished his bananas and was again strapped to the electric chair, only to have it fail again. Jim was set free again.

Another train station had a job opening and Jim applied again. He went all over the tracks, left and right, until he ran over a man.

His parents are amazed that he was finally able to speak and his first words were even in a complete sentence. They ask him, ""That was amazing, but you could have spoken much sooner. What took you so long to finally speak?"" 

He replied, ""Up until now, everything has been satisfactory.""",A German Baby,44

Huge in fact, it seems to cover the entire pond! Realising that this isn't really a problem after all, he continues about his usual magic newt daily business. He swims around for a bit, visiting all of his favourite pond hangouts. Feeling hungry, the newt decides to use his magic powers to form a black hole to suck lots of tiny fish in for him to eat. The black hole starts to form, slowly bending reality as we know it. 

All of a sudden the fisherman starts to lift the net out of the water. Up and up it goes. The net has now risen well above the water and the newt can no longer swim around as quickly as before, and instead has to slowly walk, stumbling over the netting with every other step. What's worse, the newt is now completely blocked by the net and unable to go to his favourite places. The newt looks up to see the fisherman peering into the net, directly at him. The fisherman opens his mouth and shouts 'see, this is what happens when you mess with net newt reality!’.

""What is it?"" he asks, intrigued.

""It's a chicken that gives blowjobs,"" she says.

Okay, that sounds a bit weird, he thinks, but what the hell, ""I'll do it,"" he says.

The hostess puts him in a room with a stunning marble floor, mirrors everywhere (on the ceiling too, of course), an enormous v red velvety bed and a plush purple armchair. She soon ushers in a sexy looking chicken dressed in black and pink lace lingerie. He takes out his cock (no pun intended), and attempts to put it in the chicken's mouth. The chicken does not appear interested at all, and just walks around the floor, randomly pecking at small bits of fluff. He tries talking dirty to it and stroking it (the first ""it"" is the chicken, the second is his penis), and even does a sexy dance, but nothing works. Disappointed, he knocks on the door and tells the hostess that the chicken isn't doing the job. The hostess apologizes, says the chicken must be having an off day, and tells him they won't charge him, and his next visit will be on the house.

At first, he is disappointed, but as the week passes, he thinks it wasn't so bad, and was kind of fun, and anyway the next visit is on the house, so he goes back, and says to the hostess, ""so what have you got for me today?"" She says that they are having a special treat - two men and two women will be having sex in an inflatable pool full of chocolate pudding, while their extended families will stand around them and masturbate. ""You are more than welcome to join the masturbators,"" she said.

Sure, why not, he thinks. She leads him into a large auditorium. The party has already begun. A large group of men and women are standing or sitting, masturbating, and in the middle, separated from them by a thin glass wall, is an inflatable pool filled with chocolate pudding, and in it a smorgasbord of 8 hands, 8 legs, 4 mouths, 2 penises and 2 vaginas writhing in ecstasy. 

As he whips out his cock and begins masturbating, he catches the eye of a man standing next to him and says ""holy shit, this is fucking amazing.""

The state consulted behavioural experts, and performed autopsies of some of the dead birds and determined that they were scavenging by the roadside, and being struck by vehicles.

Normally, crows in groups will take turns eating, with one or two performing as lookouts to give warning if something approaches, and they're smart enough to know that getting hit by a car is bad news.

In these cases, they lookouts were in place, but after observation the final lesson learned was that while the lookout crows could yell ""Cah Cah"", they couldn't yell ""Truck!""

The knight thinks that's a load of Dragon shit, so he saunters over and buys her a flagon of ale.

One ale leads to another, and before he knows it he wakes up next her at her castle.

Proud of himself and brimming over with confidence, he decides to ask her about the rumor. 

""Hey there Pixie-dust, let me ask you a question. Is there any truth to the rumor that you curse every guy you ""ride the Kraken"" with? 

She glares at him, and he starts to get nervous that he might have made a mistake. Then she says ""No, of course not. But let me ask you a question...""

She looks deep into his eyes, and he's immediately overcome with emotion. His heart feels like it's going to burst right through his plate mail.  He knows at that moment he never wants to leave her side. He'd take on a cave troll for her unarmed. He'd rush headlong into an army of orcs for her. And then she says in the sweetest voice he's ever heard...

The helper was a bit confused, but agreed.  The farmer stuck the pipe up the cow's butt and blew as hard as he could. To the helper's amazement, the eyes went perfectly straight, so he wound up and hit the cow as hard as he could.  But they eyes went back crossed. 

The farmer looked and said, ""you're not doing it right.  You have to hit much harder than that.""

So they tried again.

The farmer blew,  and the helper wound up and hit with all of his strength, but the eyes went crossed again. 

""God damnit kid,"" the farmer blurted out in frustration, ""give me that damn hammer.  I'll show you how it's done!""

So the farmer snatched the hammer from his helper and stood in position. He waited for thirty seconds before he looked up and saw the helper pulling the pipe it out the cow's butt. 

""What the hell are you doing, you idiot?"" The farmer asked.  

The helper looked up and said, ""well, I'm not going to put my mouth on the same end that you did.""",It was the farmer's helper's first day.,3

A small church out in the country developed a problem when squirrels moved into the attic.

The people didn't quite know what to do as no one was really in favor of killing the small creatures.  One afternoon while the congregation was having supper on the ground outside the church, a deacon said to the pastor that he had an idea.

When he arrives on the space station, he begins repairs on the broken system, and receives a call from NASA. They tell the man that the rocket is equipped with materials to build a pub on the station,and NASA has been looking to test the effects of alcohol in space. In addition, the crew on the space station wants a pub to get drunk every now and then, and agrees to help the repairman build the pub.

They spend several days constructing it and finish they record all the data they need. The man finally boards his rocket to go back to earth, and pulls out the typewriter to work on his novel.

He was born to a very poor family and after his father died and his mother became ill, he had to work very hard to support his whole family. He tried many shops and tried to get a government job, but no one would take him because he was so poor and low in social status. Eventually, however, he found a kindly baker who took him in and trained him as his apprentice. This man became like a surrogate father to Mianbao, and over time Mianbao learned everything he knew. The baker's business became known far and wide for its delicate and delectable desserts. When the baker passed away, he left his whole business to Mianbao, who had by this time become the most respected and admired baker in all the land. One day, to celebrate the birth of his first son, the Emperor ordered a lavish feast the like of which no one throughout the land had ever even imagined. He ordered Mianbao to come to his castle and prepare the desserts. Mianbao was understandably nervous, as this was by far the most prestigious job he had ever had. He was uncertain what to do, what could possibly be a delicious enough creation to celebrate something as important as the birth of the new heir to the throne of all of China? The emperor sent a team of men and horses to carry Mianbao to the castle in the most lavish fashion that a commoner had ever been transported. The whole journey all he could think about was are all the possible confectionaries he could devise, and he worried greatly about what would happen to his reputation and even potentially his life if he didn't live up to the expectations of the emperor. Finally, just as he neared the castle, Mianbao had an idea. He would make a new kind of dessert that he had never thought of before - a delicious cookie with a very unique, special texture and an amazing taste. He worked all morning at the castle kitchen preparing his special cookies. When the time finally came, many toasts, appetizers, the main course, and sides of all types had been eagerly eaten by all the guests and it was time for the dessert. With great trepidation, Mianbao brought the huge, lavish gold-and-jewel-encrusted plate covered in his special cookies out to the banquet table. As the guests all sipped their rice wine, the emperor picked up a single cookie and took a single bite. His eyes lit up and he turned to Mianbao and enquired, excitedly, why this delicious cookie came apart in such a delicate way in his hand.

Mianbao replied ""Well, your Grace, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.""",Ancient Chinese Parable,2

One day a young woman went to the well to fetch water, and the well heard her crying, and asked “What’s wrong?”

She stopped her sobbing and asked the well “You can talk?”

“Yes,” said the well. “Long ago, the witch who lives in this town gave me life so I could serve as a guardian to the townspeople.”

“Alas,” said the young woman. “I am the daughter of that witch. She lived in peace with the townsfolk for many years. But the new mayor, who is a violent and hateful man, riled the people up against her, and they burned her at the stake. I am young and still do not know very much magic. I tried to curse them, but my curses fizzled. Now I worry I will never avenge my mother’s death.”

“Do not be afraid,” said the well. “I will take care of this.”

The next morning, when the Mayor came to fetch water from the well, he heard an odd noise coming from the bottom. He peered over as far as he could to see what was happening. Then an impossibly long arm shot up from the bottom of the well, grabbed the mayor, and pulled him into the well shaft. There was a horrible crunching sound, and nobody ever saw the Mayor again. The townsfolk apologized to the witch’s daughter, and they all lived happily ever after.
