but when you go out you \*take\* your MOBILE.

  


Sometimes you \*enjoy\* TV, but most of the time, you \*play\* with your MOBILE.

  


TV is (as good as) \*free\* for life, but for the MOBILE, if you don't \*pay,\* the services will be \*terminated.\*

  


TV is \*big, bulky\* and most of the time \*old,\*

After many days with no luck, and the female gorilla getting more  frustrated, he decided to try his last option. So he tracks down the  janitor of the zoo and says to him ""Steve, I have to ask you a big  favor... I need you to have sex with the female gorilla. It's worth 2000  dollars.""

The janitor agrees so long as three conditions are met.

They went to various doctors who prescribed them various meds and treatments but nothing seemed to just work. Finally, fed up with all the meds, the couple turns Lord Vishnu to prayers. They pray for a child and they pray hard. Finally, seeing their dedication and strong prayers, Lord Vishnu finally decides to appear in front of them.

""Tell me my dears,"" he says.

""Lord Vishnu! We haven't had the fortune of parenting a child. Please bless us with a child"", both of them say, tears flowing from their eyes.

""So let be it,"" says Lord Vishnu and blesses them before disappearing.

&amp;#x200B;

Months later, the couple is blessed with a charming baby boy. Their happiness knew no bounds and they thanked the Lord every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Years passed and the boy grew up to a not so charming naughty piece of shit who used to open his mouth either to eat or throw abuses at people, including his parent.

Fed up with the boy, the couple once again pray to the Lord.

Voila! Lord Vishnu appears again.

&amp;#x200B;

""Tell me my dears"", the Lord says.

""Lord Vishnu! It's true we asked for a child but he turned out to be the worst child any parent could hope for. We are fed up with everyone complaining about his foul mouth. Please help us. Help him mend his ways"" the couple said, teary-eyed.

&amp;#x200B;

""I will do as you please"", the Lord says and disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

The Lord appears in the fields where the boy is playing alone with a ball. 

The boy sees the god appeared before him.

""Who the fuck are you?""

""Son! I'm Lord Vishnu"" says the Lord, with a smile.

""So? Should I shit on your face?"" the boy says, unimpressed with the whole God thing.

""Dear son! I know you are foul-mouthed. But one must learn to utter words that bring peace to your soul. Words of beauty, that will bring you happiness. Foul words don't suit the good. They are words for the vile.""

""Are you done before I throw this ball into your fuckin' mouth?"" the boy was clearly not in the mood.

""Boy! You are testing my patience. Foul words just ruin your soul. Bring immense pain to you and your surrounding"", the Lord said, clearly losing his patience.

""Fuck your patience"" the boy roared.

""Another word and I'll kill you boy"" the Lord thundered.

""Let's try you, son of a bitch,"" the boy said.

The Lord, now visibly angry, aimed his 'chakra' at the boy's throat in an attempt to behead the evil being. As the chakra neared, the boy just tilted his head and the 'chakra' passed, missing its target.

&amp;#x200B;

Angry, the Lord cried, hitting his head,

The Pope, understandably angered by this, begins to fiercely chastise the bishop. ""How dare you say such filth in the hall of the Lord himself?"" he says to the bishop. The bishop apologizes again, and the game goes on.

Eventually, the game reaches its final phase. The bishop takes the winning shot, misses, and says again without thinking,""Oh shit, I missed!"" The Pope begins to yell and scream louder than he ever has before. ""I shall smite you with the thunder of the heavens!"" he yells.

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy birthday!"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy birthday"".

I thought... well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn't say a word.

So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!

""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".

""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there...

On the couch...

I asked her what she did for a living. She said she taught sunday school. Now I never had me a Christian girl, but I'm open minded so I took her to dinner.

On the way, I lit a joint and asked her if she puffs.

""Oh heaven's no, what would I tell my Sunday school children.""

I said okay, weed's 50/50 some people do some people don't.  And I took her to the best restaurant I knew. I ordered the steak, she ordered the lobster. I asked for the second most expensive bottle of wine on the menu. When the waitress came to pour, She said she didn't drink.

I said ""you don't drink?!?""

""Oh heaven's no, what would I tell my Sunday school children.""

Excellent food, sparkling conversation but i'm bummed out, I don't know what to do with a girl like this.

Prophetic words, for over the next sand dune they spy what appears to be an Arab market in the distance, and they make for it with the last of their strength. On arriving, they go to the first stall, and they say to the stallholder ""Good day to you, and have you any water for sale?""

""No,"" says the stallholder, ""but what I do have is these delicious desserts. Consider this glorious bottom layer composed of fruits and sponge cake, the middle layer of exquisite custard, and the topping of whipped cream and multi-coloured sugar strands - is it not a sight to gladden the eye?""

And the travellers agree but regretfully concede that it would only make them all the thirstier, so they go on to the next stall. As before they ask for water, but all the stallholder has for sale is another such dessert as the first vendor was selling - a confection of sponge cake and fruit and sugar and custard and cream which, regretfully, does not answer their need for drinking water at all.

And it's the same story at every other stall in the market: a score of different variations on the same dessert theme, and not a drop of water to be had.

Eventually the two Englishmen are forced to concede that there is probably no hope for them here and they set off into the desert once more, and Carruthers says, ""Well, it looks like we are done for indeed, but I have to say, Blenkinsop, that was most strange, wouldn't you say?""

They fell in love, had a great time together, you know. They married eventually, got two children. Then the troubles started in his marriage. The one child got hurt on the playground. His wife started yelling at him. Then that continued. Eventually she abused him. She took his money and went gambling. Eventually the marriage was about to break. So they went to counseling, her gambling addiction came up, she blamed him on it, there was a huge argument, but they just saved the marriage somehow.

Then the other child got into puberty. Now with a daughter in puberty, there was a lot of stress. They had to go to counseling each week. But after half a year or so, the marriage was saved. Still, what bugs me most about that story is that he did never show up to our friday evenings where we drank and watched movies and had men-friends-time. Too busy with his family life. But they hold together and are about to have grandchildren.

Oh, sorry, I digressed. I wanted to tell you why you never should click on the girls near you ads. Yea, well, he got malware and I had to remove it. All his data was lost to some cryptovirus and I had to format his hard disk. On the bright side, when he brought his computer over, my sister fell in love with him, and later married him, as detailed above.","Never click on the ""Girls near you"" ads on shady websites",0

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

After no rescue arrived three days after the horrific crash, he exhausted the scant rations on the six-seater plane and began to search for water and small game. Upon returning from a nearby stream he was delighted to see a large bird perched on a tree stump.  He grabbed a rock and managed to haphazardly stun the bird after which he quickly bludgeoned and defeathered it.  

He built a fire to roast his dinner which was noticed by the search party looking for the ill-fated crash.  Several rescue personnel accompanied by the game warden descended on his camp to discover the man eating his kill for the day on a skewer much too everyone's delight.  But the revelry was short-lived as game warden notice that man was eating a near extinct species of a tagged indigenous bird the California condor. ""What the hell are you doing?"" The game warden exclaimed, ""that's a tagged California condor &amp; one of only three mating pairs in this region!!"". The survivor replied that he was starving and unsure of any rescue efforts I was merely trying to keep himself alive.  He ardently apologized, but the game warden was indignant and felt it was his duty to report the incident to Federal authorities.

Local and national news coverage, as well as the zealous protests of animal rights activists soon made the man the subject of infamy and ridicule in the year that followed. A much-publicized trial followed resulting in the man receiving a hefty fine probation and community service which further outraged his critics.  Now known as the infamous ""California condor killer"" he became unemployed, divorced, and depressed.  Unable to outrun his notoriety he changed his appearance and moved to a small town in the Midwest hoping to be forgotten.

Eating alone in a diner several years later, he was recognized by a high profile reporter passing through town. ""Hey! You're the California condor guy!!! Oh my God I can't believe it! You've got to give me a story you've never told your side that's all any of us ever wanted to do is to here what you had to say!!"".  Again the survivor refused any official story and began to walk away. The reporter quickly collected himself and said ""okay, okay fine just answer one question for me, completely off the record it's just mainly out of curiosity please.""  The man let out a sigh and said ""okay what is it?"".  ""So you're the only man on record to have ever eaten a California condor...""
""Yeah? the exasperated survivor muttered.  ""I just got to know one thing... what did it taste like?"" 

The California Condor Killer took in a deep breath, look both ways and replied: ""you really want to know?"".  ""Yes, yes for God's sake!!""
   ""It tasted like something between a bald eagle and a spotted owl...""",The California Condor Joke,1

After no rescue arrived three days after the horrific crash, he exhausted the scant rations on the six-seater plane and began to search for water and small game. Upon returning from a nearby stream he was delighted to see a large bird perched on a tree stump.  He grabbed a rock and managed to haphazardly stun the bird after which he quickly bludgeoned and defeathered it.  

He built a fire to roast his dinner which was noticed by the search party looking for the ill-fated crash.  Several rescue personnel accompanied by the game warden descended on his camp to discover the man eating his kill for the day on a skewer much too everyone's delight.  But the revelry was short-lived as the game warden noticed that the man was eating a near extinct species of a tagged indigenous bird....the California Condor. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" The game warden exclaimed, ""that's a tagged California condor &amp; one of only three mating pairs in this region!!"". The survivor replied that he was starving and unsure of any rescue efforts, was merely trying to keep himself alive.  He ardently apologized, but the game warden was indignant, and felt it was his duty to report the incident to Federal authorities.

Vigorous local &amp; national news coverage ensued.  The case also drew the ire &amp; zealous protests of animal rights activists which soon made the man the subject of infamy and ridicule in the year that followed. A much-publicized trial followed resulting in the man receiving a hefty fine, probation, and community service which further outraged his critics.  

Now known as the infamous ""California Condor Killer"" he became unemployed, divorced, and depressed.  Unable to outrun his notoriety he changed his appearance and moved to a small town in the Midwest hoping to be forgotten.

Eating alone in a diner several years later, he was recognized by a high profile reporter passing through town. ""Hey! You're the California condor guy!!! Oh my God I can't believe it! You've got to give me a story you've never told your side that's all any of us ever wanted to do here is report what you had to say!!"".  Again the survivor refused any official story and began to walk away. 

The reporter quickly collected himself and said ""okay, okay fine just answer one question for me, completely off the record it's just mainly out of curiosity please.""  The man let out a sigh and said ""okay what is it?"".  ""So you're the only man on record to have ever eaten a California condor...""
""Yeah? the exasperated survivor muttered.  ""I just got to know one thing... what did it taste like?"" 

The California Condor Killer took in a deep breath, look both ways and replied:
  ""It tasted like something between a bald eagle and a spotted owl..."" 😏",The California Condor Killer...,1

&amp;#x200B;

Elon says he wants to drive the first off road Tesla vehicle on Martian soil. James says he brought his ocean diving vessel and will take a plunge into the Martian waters to explore the depths below. Jack mentions that he will pin a giant Lakers jersey and the American flag onto the red rocks so he can see it back on earth. Jack also surprises Elon and James with life-sized cardboard cutouts of all three of them and places them in between their seats. Elon with his entrepreneurship and drunken intellect comes up with a drinking game and gives the cardboard cutouts the names Fake Elon, Fake James and Fake Jack. James and Jack go along with it and enjoy this moment of ingenuity in their drunken stupor. 

&amp;#x200B;

 They're making good progress on their way to Mars and having a good time when all of a sudden they see a huge cluster of comets heading into the trajectory of their spaceship. They're trying to steer off the course of the comets but the gravitational pull and the speed of the comets renders their efforts unsuccessful. They are now on course for a direct collision and all three start praying to God save them with a miracle. 

&amp;#x200B;

They soon see a bright light shining directly into the spaceship and before they know it, they see a giant web around the spaceship that pulls it off course and safely slows them down for a gentle landing onto the biggest comet. Upon landing, they see three alien spaceships controlling the giant web they're in. Another bright light is shining upon Elon's spaceship and in perfect English, one of the aliens announces ""Welcome to our home earthly friends. Please open the entrance to your ship so we can exchange greetings."" Elon does so and all three are amazed at their ability to communicate in earthly languages and their technological advancement. They decide to share their stash of alcohol and weed with the aliens. The aliens give them a tour of the comet after giving them protective gear. 

&amp;#x200B;

After several hours of getting completely hammered, the aliens let Elon and gang know that they have to leave this comet from another one but will safely launch them into space for continuing onto mars. Right before boarding the ship, Jack decides he needs to take a huge dump on this comet. He decides to lower himself into a crater for some privacy. The aliens start rushing Elon and James to the aircraft and soon, they escort them into orbit and launch them into space. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once the hangover wears off, James notices that Elon is sleeping and that Jack is missing. He starts freaking out and wakes up Elon. Elon wakes up from his drunken slumber and asks James ""what's going on? calm down. By the way, where is Jack? I only see the fake Jack here."" to which James responds ""Oh My God Elon, the real Jack is in the comets""",Elon Musk takes James Cameron and Jack Nicholson into his first space expedition to Mars,0

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to cry. They cried, I cried, we all cried together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Apparently, I was still lost.","As a guitarist, I play many gigs.",18

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.""

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

The drunk interjects, sluring his words ""It waz mono y mono I'a tell you. mono y mono."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm pretty sure it's *mano a mano*,"" the man quips.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well anyway,"" continued the bartender ""The one fella, short thick guy with huge arms, pulls out a beer bottle off the ground, bares his teeth, yells, and throws it at the other guy, who's even shorter, even thicker, and has even bigger arms. So the second fella is enraged by this, and he bares his teeth and screams, picks up a brick off the ground and throws it at the first guy!""

""Again, I hate to be pedantic, but it's *mano a mano*,"" the man points out.""That's not even half of it though,"" says the bartender. ""Next, the first guy is punching and beating the second guy, has him down on the ground, almost out, and the second guy pulls a gun from behind his back! Not a clue where he was hiding it. He's shooting and shooting, and the first guy goes and hides behind a dumpster, till the second guy has emptied his his cartridge like a raving loonie. Soon as he's done, the first guy runs, wrestles the gun away, and beats the second guy over the head with it. Unbelievable! The second guy got it back for a bit though, so he's landed some hard hits on the first guy. I'd say they're both a writhing mess in the gutter at this point with as long as they've been fighting.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Mono y mono!"" shouted the drunk, as he fell out of his chair.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well hey,"" the bartender said to the man, ""I gotta clean up this drunk. How about you peer out back for a bit and see if the fight is still going on. That is, unless you have something better to do.""

The man didn't have something better to do. It was 3pm on a Wednesday, and he was in the kind of bar where people fight in the alley.

Upon the walls of photography lies the vessel I will use to capture the moments of my walk in the park. There’s big ones, small ones, red ones, long ones, heavy ones and light ones. I don’t too much care for looks, so I narrow my choices to just the black ones.

I figure I will need to zoom in close to accurately portray the beauty of my park walks. So I pick a long one. I imagine I will be awfully trigger happy, so I choose a large memory card. 

I purchase the camera and the cards and I hop in the car and happily drive all the way home. Once I’m home, I unbox the camera. I read all the manuals. Tomorrow is the day I begin my journey into memorializing my view of the park.

I take some practice photos in my kitchen of salt shakers sitting out. I compose the pictures just so where the image has a story. Once I am happy with my practice shots, I lay to sleep with happy nervousness in the sheets.

I wake before dawn full of glee. I put on my clothes and ready my camera. I hop in the car and drive to the park.

I sit on the bench and pull out my camera and I turn it on. I snap a photo of a squirrel with a nut too big for his hands. I look at the cameras screen to see what I took, and it’s beautiful. As I’m looking at it I hear some birds in the tree next to the bench. I point the camera and click, but the shutter didn’t activate. I look at the screen and see the abysmal red battery. 

With quick thinking, I pull out my cell phone and aim it at the two robins on the branch and snap what is easily the best photo I’ve ever taken. It’s so simple yet so perfect.

Who needs a fancy camera? I got two birds with one phone.",I’ve always enjoyed nature...,4

They  walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping,  squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. They arrive at a fountain,  where the atheist notices the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other.  The man couldn´t be any happier.

A few days later the atheist is having a walk and sees a sad horse sitting on the bench. The atheist asks the horse what it is doing here, but the horse replies that there were no free spaces in horse hell, so it was sent to human hell.

So they walk into a bar, an atheist orders his drink and when the bartender sees the horse he asks ""Why the long face?"".",An atheist dies and goes to hell,3

His wife of 30 years divorced him, his children died young, and his boss fired him after 2 decades of employment. He once heard that people can do certain acts that will bring good fortune, specific to each Star sign. So he traveled to a psychic reader in hopes to find out how to bring good luck into his sad, pathetic life.

The psychic read his palm, looking pensively at the lines and cracks. 
“You are an Aeries!” Exclaims the psychic. 

Jerry looked inquisitive. 
“As an aeries, what can I do to bring good fortune into my life?”

“Well, you must proclaim your star sign to the birds of the air. Once these birds see that you are an aeries, they will bestow upon your head chains of gold and a crown of jewels.”

After hearing this, Jerry left the psychic, excitedly thinking of ways he can profess his sign to the birds. He walked to his apartment in deep thought. But the more he thought, the more difficult it became to think of a solution. Jerry gradually grew depressed. But as he reached the door to his apartment in defeat, his eyes lit up. His smile widened. He knew exactly how to tell the birds. 

He sprang from his front doorstep and ran to the nearest Home Depot. He gathered up all of their wood picket signs and paint, and rushed home. There was no time to lose. He took the paint and wrote “Jerry is an Aeries” across each and every sign. Once he finished, he grabbed all the signs and hauled ass to the nearest baseball field. There he planted each and every sign down in nice neat rows, so the birds can easily read it.

And this became known as Jerry’s sign field.",Unlucky Jerry,0

Thinking it’s safe enough with no one around for miles, they all sleep in their own sleeping bags with no one guarding. However, when they wake up, they discover that half the knights have disappeared!

That night, after walking further into the woods, the king and his 256 knights set up camp after checking for danger. They decide it’s safe enough to sleep without a guard. However, when they wake up, half the knights have disappeared again! Meanwhile, the king spots a speck in the distance.

After the king and his 128 knights travel for hours, they arrange to leave a few guards out while the others sleep for the night. Unfortunately, in the morning it’s discovered that another half of knights has vanished. This time, the king notices the speck has grown to become a silhouette in the distance, but he thinks nothing of it.

The next night, the king and his 64 knights travel, then set up an elaborate system of making sure the knights guarding never fall asleep. However, the morning comes, the king and his knights wake up, and only 32 knights remain! This time the silhouette has come closer and the king can clearly see a man is following them.

After travelling for hours, the knights build a small wall to protect everyone, as well as setting up lots of guards. But, of course, half of them vanish by the morning and 16 remain. The king sees that the man following them is much nearer, but he’s never seen moving.

The next evening, a whole castle is built and fortified, and everyone except the king is put on guard. Come the next morning, only half remain while the follower waits right outside the castle.

This repeats until finally the king has only 1 knight to guard him. They don’t bother with any extra protection and the king falls asleep. However, the knight is gone in the morning and the follower is standing right over the king when he wakes up! The king asks, “What happened to all my knights and why were you following us?”

After hesitating and thinking for a while, he finally drank it.

His friends cheered and immediately tried to convince Bob to take another one and he agree'd because he thought it tasted really good.

It continued like this for a while until someone asked them to go home because they were very drunk. Bob slowly turned around and said:

-Oh look guys, he wants to fight.

But Bob was too drunk to fight so his friends had to stop him...

The next day Bob had gotten accused for a crime he didn't remember committing.

In court the next week the judge asked Bob:

-You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?

-Yes.

-Did you commit this horrific atrocity to Fred and his family?

-I don't know what you're talking about.

-Objection, shouted Fred's lawyer. 

-Objection accepted, answered the judge. 

-All the signs are there, Bob's the one who did it.

One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native American.


‘What are you doing here?’ the old man asked.


‘We are here as a part of a research expedition that will very soon travel to explore the Moon!’


‘The Moon?! Hmm... could you then do me a favor?’


‘What do you want?’


‘Well, the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the Moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people.’


‘What’s the message?’


The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorized it correctly.


‘What does it mean?’ asked the astronauts.


‘Oh, I cannot tell you. It’s a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.’


The astronauts were intrigued with the secret message, so when they returned to their base they searched and searched until they finally found one Native American who could speak old man's tribal language and translate the message. 


When they repeated the message they had memorized, the translator started to laugh his ass off.


‘Why are you laughing man, what does the message say?’


'It says - Don’t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.’
