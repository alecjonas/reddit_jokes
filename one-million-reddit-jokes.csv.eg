The grandfather was very surprised that she would ask such a question. But he decided that if she was old enough to know to ask the question, then she was old enough to get a straight answer.
Feeling uncomfortable, he steeled himself and proceeded to tell her all about human reproduction and the joys and responsibilities of sexual intercourse.
When he finished, the little girl was looking at him with her mouth hanging open and her eyes wide in amazement.
Seeing the look on her face, the grandfather asked her: ""Why did you ask this question, honey?''
""Well,'' the little girl replied,"" Grandma says that dinner will be ready in just a couple secs.''",An 8 year old girl asks a question to her grandfather.,550
post,btrv2u,2qh72,jokes,false,1558993795,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/btrv2u/an_average_father_gives_his_average_son/,self.jokes,,"....a ping pong table for his 12th birthday, and to his surprise the son loves ping pong. Plays it every day and night, and when no friends or family wants to play a round with him the kid sets up the table against a wall and pracices with himself.

After a few years the father notices that his son is playing ping pong less and less, He asks him about this and the son replies, ""Can't. No more ping pong balls"". The father looks and just like his son had told him there were no longer any balls left on the table. ""OK"", he thought, he lost them. No big deal.

Approaching the sons 14th birthday the father decides he wants to do something extra special. He finds his son watching TV and says, ""Son! It's almost your 14th birthday! What kind of bike would you like?!"". The son (without moving his head away from the TV) just replies, ""NO Bike dad, I want ping pong balls"". The father was a little taken back by this, he continued and asked, ""What do you mean? You don't want a bike son? You're turning 14?!?!"". The son made further comment and just returned to his program.

Well this wasn't going to fly the father thought. You know what.. I'm buying him the damn bike! So the father goes to the local sporting goods store and picks his son out a nice stylish bike with all of the shocks and removable doo dads he can get. He also decides to get him a few packs of ping pong balls and throw them in the helmet hanging from the handlebars.

The morning of his sons birthday the father sets up the bike with a big ribbon then goes off to work. Returning home the father finds the bike sitting in the living room seemingly untouched. The bow is still on it, the kick stand still in the perfect little carpet divit it created from this morning. .. but .. all of the ping pong balls were gone. The father assumes the son must be playing ping pong! But to his surprise he finds him in his bedroom playing on his game console.

The father asks the son, ""Son! What is wrong with the bike? don't you like it?""

""Yea dad, good bike, great bike, love the bike"", replies the son.

the father can't help but question; ""so what happened to the ping pong balls"". but the son ignores him. The father assumes his son lost the balls already and is too embarrased to tell him so drops the subject and moves on.

the next year for the boys 15th birthday the father decides he wants him to have a new computer. Knowing this isn't something you can just buy for someone he asks his son, ""Son! What kind of computer would you like for your birthday?"". The son answers shortly, ""No computer, Ping pong balls"". The father thinks this is a bit odd but knows how much his son enjoys ping pong so doesn't say anything else about the subject.

After buying the new computer for his son and setting it up the father (again) tosses a few packages of ping pong balls in with the present and off to work he goes. 5pm rolls around and the father returns home to find the computer hasn't even been started up. His son is sitting in the living room listening to music and the ping pong balls have all dissapeared.

This time the father wants answers; he says to the son ""Son! What was wrong with the computer?""

""Nothing dad, good computer, great computer, love the computer"", replies the son.

OK thinks the father, ""Also what happened to the ping pong balls?"".

The son doesn't reply, going back to his music he ignores the father. Being a good trustworthy son in the past the father decides to let this drop. If his son didn't like the presents he's sure he would tell him.

Approaching the sons 16th birthday the father thinks, ""Ok this is the year! I will finally give him a present he won't be able to ignore! I'll buy him a car!"". The father finds the son and says ""Son! What kind of car do you want for your birthday?"" The son replies to the father with the same reply he's been giving for all occasions from 12 until now, ""Dad, I want ping pong balls"". ""What?!"" exclaims the father, ""You are turning 16! you are getting a car!"".

Being a little annoyed now the father decides to pull a fast one on his son, After buying him a new car he decided to prank his son and fill it from floor to sunroof with thousands of ping pong balls. He put them in the trunk, the vents, the glove box, under the seats.. everywhere.. Pushed the car into the drive way with a big bow on it and off to work he went.

Driving upto the house after work the father notices the car doors are open, so is the trunk. As he gets closed he also notices the bow and ribbons were still on the car... It hadn't been moved! AND ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS ARE GONE! ""Ok"" he says to himself. ""He's good""

Thinking his son just taught him a lesson on pranking the father walks into the house expecting a pie in the face or to be drowned in his own ping pong ball joke... instead his son is just sitting at the computer chatting on MSN.

""Son! Don't you like the car!?"" yells the father.

""Yea dad, good car, great car, love the car"", replies the son.

""Well WTF happened to the ping pong balls?!"" the father almost screams.

But again, the son just ignores his father. The father dismisses this as his son just trying to get under his skin for the innital prank and once again ignores it.

So a few years have passed and for every occasion the son is asked what he would like his reply is only ever ""ping pong balls"". Unfortunatly for the son, around his mid 30's he's diagnosed with a terminal illness and is laying on his death bed.

""Son"", walks in the father, ""You are not long of this world. Is there anything I can do for you or get you to make you more comfortable? Pictures of loved ones? Sweets? Anything?"". The son looking very weak and pale says, ""ping pong balls dad... ping pong balls."" The father doesn't even argue this time; he runs down to the gift shop and gets a basket and fills it with sweets, flowers, goes into his wallet and pulls out all of the family photos and by sure dumb luck there is a 5 pack of ping pong balls in the gift shop so he buys that as well.

Returning to the room the father gives the basket to his son and kisses him on the forehead. He turns around and asks the nurse a question, only to find when he turned back that ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS WERE GONE! This does it: ""Son?"" asks the father.

""Yes dad""

""Have I been a good father to you?"" the father questions.

""Yes dad, you've been a good dad, great dad. I love you dad.""

""Then can I ask you one thing before our time is up?"".

""Yes dad, anything."" says the son. Looking very weak now.

""Ok, well, I just wanted to know after all of these years. What happened to all of the ping pong balls?"" said the father.

""Ok dad... I'll tell you."" and the son took a deep breath.

Then he died.",An average father gives his average son.....,4

After this final refusal to acquiesce to the others' requests, a bit of mud slinging and trash talking ensued for several minutes. This caused the English Headman (over the crew, over the Captain, the direct link to the Queen) to interfere over the line:

The following day, he goes to his school. When its finally his turn to present, the teacher asks him to speak about airplanes instead of cows, since that topic was already presented by another kid.

The guy in the drive thru brings his order to the window.

""Hey, your order is here!""

The dad thought that he should wait a second to help the survivors, then get his kid's dinner.

""Come on it's like -3 degrees out here, it's gonna get cold!""

""Just wait a second""

The dad finishes helping the passengers, and goes back to the window to get his kid's dinner.

He grabs it and gets back in his car.

On the way home he sees four escaped tigers from the zoo attacking a young couple, luckily he used to work at the zoo, and still has a tranquilliser.

The dad get's out of his car and takes out the tigers.

""Ok, hopefully now i can get home""

He gets back in the car but some gang members in armoured cars start to chase him down the road.

It's a straight up car chase like in the movies.

He remembers that when he was a cop, he met this gang while undercover.

he tries to lose them in a forest on the side of the road, he succeeds and never sees them again.

at long last, he makes it home, unfortunately he was back 10 minutes too late, but his kid was patient.

He then realises he lost his kid's dinner.

""Oh, sorry son, i must have lost your dinner""

""but daaaaaaaad, I'm hungry""

**""Hi Hungry, I'm Dad""**",A dad goes out to get dinner for his kid,2

He has been working the route for 30 years. He receives a few thank you cards, and some small gifts, which really makes him feel appreciated.

As his day is coming to an end, he comes to one of the final houses. As he puts the mail in the slot, and the door opens...

A beautiful blonde, stands there in sexy lingerie, and signals for him to come in. He gulps, and closes the door behind him.

The blonde says, ""Come on in, I knew it was your last day, and I thought I'd make you breakfast""!

He is in shock, but sits down, and enjoys one of the best meals of his life. He finishes the meal, not being able to take his eyes off of his, much younger, beautiful hostess. As he finishes, he thanks her, and turns to leave...

As he reaches the door, the sexy blonde grabs him by the arm, and says, ""I have another surprise for you upstairs""! She slips off the lingerie on her way up the steps and disappears into a room...

The mail man throws down his stuff, strips down, and scrambles up the steps. They enjoy an afternoon full of passion. He thanks her for the best sex of his life, collects his belongings, and again turns to leave...

As he opens the door the beautiful blonde runs up behind him, ""I almost forgot"". She hands him a five dollar bill. He stares at her in disbelief and confusion, ""I have to ask, breakfast was great, upstairs was even better, but what is the $5 for""?

The blonde explains, ""Oh silly, my husband and I knew it was your last day. I told him I wanted to do something special for you. He said that old bastard, fuck him, give him five bucks... but breakfast was my idea""",Retiring mail man,50

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,17

The customer replies, saying that he wants coleslaw on the bottom, cheddar cheese with no chili flakes on top, followed by sliced chicken on top of the cheese. The worker puts sliced beef on the bottom, cheddar cheese with chili flakes in the middle and lettuce on top. *The customer gets internally aggravated at the worker, but then the customer suddenly recognizes the worker. After he recognizes the worker, he immediately knows what might be going on, but he doesn't tell the worker.* The worker asks him if he wants any sauce on his sub. The customer tells the worker to **not** put BBQ sauce on his sub. The worker then asks how he wants his sauce to be put on the sub. The customer says to **not** spell out the letters S, A and L with BBQ sauce. The worker then grinningly spells out S, A and L on the sub with BBQ sauce. The customer then tells the worker **not** to close the sandwich, **not** to wrap the sandwich up in paper, **not** to get a baggy of Nacho Cheese Doritos and **not** to get a bottle of Pepsi. The worker smiles even more and surprisingly wraps up the sub, gets the baggy of Doritos **and** get the bottle of Pepsi for the customer. The customer notices that the worker smiles about the whole situation, and asks the worker with a big smile to pay for his order. The worker walks up to the customers and says ""Wait wait wait, I can't do this!"" The worker laughs to the customer and tells him ""You probably knew this by the time you kept on smiling, but I'm Sal Vulcano from the TV show *Impratical Jokers*, and the guys in the back just challenged me in this ear piece to do the exact opposite of what you asked.

The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the Blackwall Tunnel approach recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu.

 A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. 

By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with lorrys, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. 

The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. 

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Lorry""",Blackwall Tunnel has been closed and why the speed limit has been reduced:,25

So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,1

Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, as a look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees. “Whew,” says the leopard. “That was close. That Chihuahua nearly had me.”
Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But the Chihuahua saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, “Here monkey, hop on my back and see what’s going to happen to that conniving canine.”
Now the Chihuahua sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, “What am I going to do now?” But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn’t seen them yet … and just when they get close enough to hear, the Chihuahua says… “Where’s that damn monkey? I sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another leopard.”",The Chihuahua and the Leopard,1

The Captain says, ""I can't say I condone this but I understand about 'urges', so the camel can stay.""

About a month later, the Captain starts having his own 'urges'.  Crazy with passion, he asks the Sergeant to bring the camel to the back of his tent.

Putting a ladder behind the camel, the Captain stands on the ladder, pulls his pants down and has wild, insane sex with Molly.

When he's done, he asks the Sergeant, ""So, is that how the other men do it?""

“What’s wrong, Jim?” The first agent asks.

“You don’t understand!” He said.

You could hear a muffled gasp from all the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that poor Tom must have experienced.

""Tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every movement caused him terrible pain. We prayed as the doctors performed a very delicate operation, which lasted for over five hours, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, by wrapping wire around it to hold it in place.""

Again, the men in the congregation were unnerved and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery that was performed on Tom.

""Now,"" she announced in a quavering voice, ""thank the Lord, after six weeks, Tom is now out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

All the men sighed with relief.

The minister rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say. 

A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium.

No one believes seniors . . . everyone thinks they are senile.

An elderly couple was celebrating their sixtieth anniversary. The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighborhood after they retired. Holding hands, they walked back to their old school. It was not locked, so they entered, and found the old desk they'd shared, where Jerry had carved I love you, Sally.

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars!
Jerry said, We've got to give it back.
Sally said, Finders keepers. She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.

The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?

Sally said, No.

Jerry said, Shes lying. She hid it up in the attic.
Sally said, Don't believe him, hes getting senile

She blames smart phones and internet memes for this. However, Ms. Delinsky a clever lady, and she thinks she has a plan. She's going to start a 'meme' in her class: Quiz Position. She explains to her students that it's sort of like Dabbing, but instead, you do a sick move with your pencil. It can be anything you want, as long as you don't stab anybody and you end up with both hands on your desk and your mouth shut.

&amp;#x200B;

It works as well as she could have hoped. Most of her class thinks Quiz Position is hilarious, and she has a run of weeks where it becomes much easier to settle them down. Of course, there are always bad apples, and Ms. Delinsky's bad apple is named Stan. Stan is a little shit and mocks the other students over their sick moves, and generally seems prepared to become a middle school douche by Ms. Delinsky's estimation. Of course, the venom is taken out of him a little bit  because of his speech impediment: whenever Stan tries to tell somebody that Quiz Position is stupid, half the time it comes out 'spupid.' Even so, Ms. Delinsky's efforst are successful, and at the end of the year, Span--as she mockingly calls him to her husband--goes off to become a fifth grader and somebody else's problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next school year, Ms. Delinksy does a little research and figures out what the new hot internet meme is and starts up Quiz Position with her new class. And by now, it's spread all over the school. A couple of her teacher friends tell her that they've adopted it and it's working great, but to make it catchier, they're calling it 'Quizition.' Ms. Delinsky thinks that's great, and promptly adopts the portmanteau, and her success continues.

&amp;#x200B;

But about half-way through the year, Delinsky gets a new student in her class, who is just *the worst.* On his first day, Devon pulls a girl's ponytail, starts rapping in class, and then gets in a fight with another student. She expects him to be just like Span. But little does she know, Devon is also a break dancer. So when she calls for Quizition, Devon promptly busts a sick move and drops into it. Delinsky is floored. The whole class is floored.

&amp;#x200B;

No one expects the Span-ish in Quizition.",So Ms. Delinsky is trying to get her 4th-graders to settle down for a quiz.,8

And what the hunter didn’t notice was that there was a mouse watching everything. The mouse thought ‘if that fly drops six inches, that fish will jump out of the water and the bear will get him.

Rather than publicly profess his disdain for Uncle Joey, the man kept his views between himself and his parrot.

The man would talk to his parrot for ages about ""Stalin this"" or ""Stalin that,"" and eventually the parrot started repeating some of these phrases back to the man. ""Go to Siberia!"" the parrot would say. ""Down with Communism!""

Being that the parrot was considerably louder and lacked the self-control of the man, the man's neighbors started to overhear the parrot screeching obscenities about Stalin and communism. Several calls were made to the KGB, and early the next morning, a group of agents were pounding on the man's front door.

""Who is it?"" the man groaned, rolling out of bed and still halfway asleep.

""This is the KGB. Open this door at once! We have heard talk of conspiracy against the state in this house, and we are here to investigate."" the agents yelled through the door.

The man scrambled to his feet and looked around for a place to hide the parrot, who was squawking about Stalin again. Without a second thought, the man threw the parrot into his freezer. He calmly made his way to the front door and opened it for the agents. The agents wasted no time in their search for conspiracy. One agent interviewed the man, and the rest turned his home upside down looking for the parrot. They opened the freezer and found the poor bird shivering from the bitter cold. The agents took the bird out and tried to interview it, but the only thing it could say was:

""Long live Stalin! Long live Stalin!"" over and over again. 

The KGB agents began to laugh and apologized to the man for the misunderstanding and inconveniencing him so early in the morning. Before they left, they kindly reminded the man:

It goes like this...Attila was known to be very fond of dangerous wild animals. He used to collect all these exotic animals that he came across in his conquests. His favorite was a big ferocious snake. He was so fond of it that he used to bring it with him everywhere. But his snake lost its appetite perhaps due to stress the frequent travelling. So Attila, wishing to save his prized pet, sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. But unfortunately they could not help him. 
One day a wizened sage came to him and told him to feed the serpent only young female virgins.
Attila was pleased with this idea and was delighted to find that the city he raided just happened to a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food.
But the snake refused to eat or even touch the consecrated virgins. Enraged, Attila ordered to have the sage executed.
Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and a woman to me.""
Curious, Attila did as he asked. Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.
""Now hold this with both hands,"" he instructed.
Attila did so, and as soon as he did that, the snake let out a terrifying hiss and swallowed the virgin whole.
To an amazed Attila, the old man said, 
""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.""",Attila's Legend.,13

After 50 years of marriage it’s not such a bad idea.

He goes down to the store and asks the shop assistant to show him a nice shear negligee. She selects one from the corner of the store with a $250 price tag and brings it over to him. “Oh this isn’t nearly half as shear enough for what I’m looking for. Do you have anything else?” he asks. 

She goes behind the counter and gets another negligee from under the desk. This one costs $300 dollars. She hands it over to the elderly gentleman who inspects it closely. “It’s a little better but I’m looking for something that is shearer still!”

The assistant goes out the back and after a few minutes returns with a third negligee, this one priced at $500 and the most shear of the three. “Fantastic,” says the man “this will do perfectly.” The assistant gift wraps it all for him and he returns home.

On the night of their anniversary the couple go out for a lovely dinner and upon returning home the husband gives the gift box to his wife and tells her to take it upstairs, put it on and come out onto the landing to present herself to him while he admires from down in the foyer.

The wife takes the present upstairs and lays the box on the bed, opens it, unwraps all the paper and finds the negligee. “What a silly old man” she thinks to herself as she inspects the gift, “does he really think this is what I want?”. She wraps it all back up in the box and decides she’s going to return it and get something she really likes. As for the presentation to her husband though, she takes off all her clothes and goes out onto the landing completely stark naked.

From down in the foyer, her husband admires her and remarks on how beautiful she looks standing up there above him. She prances around a little bit to appease him and as she walks back into the bedroom inviting her husband up, he begins up the stairs and says to himself “For $500 you think they could have fucking ironed it!”",An anniversary story,6

Please do me one favor: when you get to heaven, somehow you must let me know if there’s women’s softball up there.”

Rose looked up at Barb from her deathbed and said, “Barb, you’ve been my best friend for many years. If it’s at all possible, I’ll do this favor for you.” Shortly after that, Rose passed on.

A few nights later, Barb was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to her, “Barb, Barb!”

“Who is it?”, asked Barb, sitting up suddenly. “Who is it?”

“Barb, it’s me…Rose.”

“You’re not Rose. Rose just died.”

“I’m telling you, it’s me, Rose,” insisted the voice.

“Rose! Where are you?”

“In Heaven,” replied Rose. “I have some really good news and a little bad news.”

“Tell me the good news first,” said Barb.

“The good news,” Rose said, “is that there’s softball in heaven. Better yet all of our old buddies who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we’re all young again. Better still, it’s always springtime, and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play softball all we want, and we never get tired.”

He decided that he needed them gone. As he was walking, he saw a man with a sign that said “Homeless vet. Need money.”  

“Perfect,” he thought, and approached the veteran. They negotiated a deal, but the teen had no money - but, he figured, he would have money once the inheritance came through. 

“Tell you what,” he said, “I can give you $10 now, but I’ll give you half my inheritance when it comes to me.”

“Yeah, okay,” said the vet. 

“By the way, you can call me ‘John’.  What’s your name?”

“Well, my real name is Jürgen because I was born in Zurich, but most people find that too hard to say, so I mostly just go by ‘Army’.”

“Okay, Army, here’s the deal. My parents go to the 9:30 church service, and they usually go to the mall after. Can you get them in the store?” the teen asked, handing over a photo of the doomed couple. 

“You bet”

Sunday came, and sure enough the parents were at the mall by 11:00. The vet followed them into the Dick’s Sporting Goods. Taking his trusty shank, he killed them both, but he was immediately caught by the security guard. Jürgen confessed everything. 

The next day, the paper read “Swiss Army knifes 2/$10 at Dick’s”",A teenager was sick and tired of his parents.... [Dad Joke],12

I quickly drove home, and went into my apartment. I walked inside and headed straight for my bedroom. There, I found my wife lying naked on the bed, but no man around. I quickly started searching my apartment to see where he was hiding. I was about to give up when I decided to check the balcony. When I did, I saw a man hanging over the edge of the balcony by his fingertips. I yelled “Found ya!” and punched his fingers till he lost his grip. He fell two stories but landed in a bush. Worried that he was still alive, I went inside, grabbed my refrigerator, and heaved it over the balcony over the bush. The exertion of lifting the fridge gave me a stroke, so I died.” St. Peter smiles, and agrees that qualifies as a unfortunate death. He lets the man through. The next man approaches and says “So I was doing gymnastics on my balcony when I lost my balance and fell off. I managed to catch myself on the balcony below me, but then some nutter punches my fingers till I fell! I landed in some bushes and survived the fall, but the next thing I know, a refrigerator falls on my head!” St. Peter laughs, and lets the man through. The next man comes. St. Peter asks “So how did you die?” “Picture this. I’m naked, hiding in a refrigerator...”",St. Peter’s in a bad mood and decides today he’s only going to let people who died in really sad ways through the pearly gates.,7

A new woman joins their club. When she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, ""I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?

""No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says ... Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m. He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay"".

She's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. They congratulate her and invite her back the next week. She smiles and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she plays left-handed. The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes and grins. ""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,"" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his Willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",Only fifteen minutes,5013

post,bt55k5,2qh72,jokes,false,1558855465,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bt55k5/your_duck_is_dead/,self.jokes,,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""

""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",Your duck is dead,1

David wants to borrow a horse from his neighbor, Jack.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure you can borrow my horse,"" replies Jack. ""But one thing you have to know about this horse. He is trained to start when you say 'Thank God', and he stops when you say 'Help me God.'""

&amp;#x200B;

So David gets on the horse and practices. ""Thank God"" he says, and the horse breaks into a trot. ""Help me God"" he announces, and sure enough, the horse stops. After practicing a few times, he feels confident and begins his journey.

&amp;#x200B;

As he is riding along a road, he sees that the road ends up ahead with a steep cliff. Suddenly David realizes that he has forgotten the word needed to make the horse stop.

&amp;#x200B;

""Whoa"" he squeaks, desperately. The horse keeps going.

&amp;#x200B;

""Um -  stop please"" he yells.

&amp;#x200B;

But the horse keeps galloping.

&amp;#x200B;

Now fearful that he is about to die, David  screams out, ""Help me God."" As trained, the horse stops suddenly -- right at the edge of the cliff.

&amp;#x200B;

Shaking like a leaf, David  pulls out his handkerchief and wipes the sweat from his forehead. ""Whew"" he exclaims, ""Thank God!""",The Religious Horse,16

The dog notices and starts to panic but as he’s about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly “mmm…that was some good lion meat!”. The lion abruptly stops and says ” woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can”.
Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily “get on my back, we’ll get him together”. So they start rushing back to the dog.
The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts “where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago.

For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

Why am I telling you all of this back story?

Since he wanted to experience the whole chinese culture he planned to visit every attraction, learn more about every tradition and sample every dish china had to offer.

So he went for the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the Yangtze River and the Mausoleum of Light. He even visited the 2000-year-old Terracotta Army and the Li River in Guilin, where generations of chinese painters and poets had been inspired by the beauty of nature.

Pete also met the most powerful shaolin monks, who taught him their secret zen techniques. He learned to play the erhu, the traditional chinese violin, with his magical overtones. He mastered the art of acupuncture, massage and the doctrines of materia medica, which involve using human body parts to cure diseases.

Pete ate every food he could find, going from restaurant to restaurant comparing menus. He tried all kinds of dumplings, spring rolls and dim sums. He also found out about the traditional dish “ants climbing up the tree“, which (despite chinese culinary history actually involves eating ants) does not really contain ants. When he eventually ordered the dish, he told the waiter: “Man, I was so disgusted by the name of this dish I was almost certain this would be the only chinese dish I would never try, but then I read that it doesn't really contain ants.“ 

The waiter answered: “If you really want to try everything, you have to sample the real ant dishes they have across the street. But you gotta watch out - if you are not used to this kind of food you have to tell them you want a dish made with virgin ants. Because if the ants just ejaculated they are pretty stale and hard to swallow.“ Pete thought about this for a moment and said... “So I guess the real choke is always in the come ants.“",Pete in China,2

At his father's funeral the boy swore that he would no longer love tractors, banishing them from his life.

One day, a few years later the boy who is now a young man is walking down a street in the city. He hears sirens in the distance, he runs down to see what's going on. The fire brigade had been called out to a burning building filled with fire and smoke.

The firefighters weren't able to enter the building as the smoke was already too much for them to handle. The boy overheard this, he knew what he had to do.
""Don't worry men I can clear the smoke"" he said to the firefighters. They tried to stop him as he ran into the building but it was too late he was gone.

A few seconds later the boy emerged from a smokeless building 

The confused yet amazed firefighters could only ask ""how did you do it""

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. So much so, that Juan's opponent in the presidential race tells the public to vote for Juan. Juan wins in a landslide and now he's the president. But this time he's not doing such a good job. He's not making good deals with foreign countries, taxes go up, and there's road closures everywhere. The public turns on Juan and they're looking for anything to use against him.

The pressure gets to Juan.

One day he comes home and his wife hasn't made dinner yet and he gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset... 

That he beats his wife.

And just as he realizes what he's done, his kids come running into the kitchen yelling and screaming and he gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset...

That he beats his kids.

And he realizes what he's done and goes to see his cow to calm down. He starts to milk his cow, remembering simpler days when he was just a farmer in a small town. And just as he's about to finish filling the bucket with milk, the cow kicks it over. He gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset...

That he beats his cow. 

And he's so disappointed in himself. He's let down his wife, his kids, his cow, and his country.

Well one of the White House staff see this and leaks it to the press. The public is livid. They hate Juan. He lied to them! He does beat his wife! He does beat his kids! He does beat his cow! They cry for impeachment. Juan decides to hold a press conference to address the nation.

Juan gets up on stage to make his speech when someone in the crowd yells ""Down with Juan!"" and shoots him with a golf gun.

Not sure what a golf gun is, but it sure put a hole in Juan.",So this farmer named Juan wants to run for city council.,26

He ultimately decides that while he may eventually forgive his wife, he cannot let the man go and so Dan decides to beat the shit out of him. He steps into the storeroom for a minute to find a suitable weapon, but to his dismay his wife and the man are both gone when he unlocks the bedroom door. From the open window sill, he deduces that they must have escaped through it. The fact that his wife decided to run away with the guy infuriates Dan even more, and he swears revenge on them both. 

Dan asks around and finds out that the man has been visiting his house regularly for the last few months. After poking around some more, he comes to know that the man his wife ran away with is a manager at the grocery store that is in their neighborhood. Dan decides to track them both down and teach them a lesson. He chases them far and wide, all over the country. They've been staying at motels, and he's always a few days late in getting to them - they're already gone by the time he arrives. Yet, he bides his time - he knows their money has to run out soon. 

Finally, one day Dan's chase leads him to a motel called ""eslaf swen"". As is usual, he asks the manager if he's seen his wife (he shows a picture) and a man. The manager tells him that yes, the couple had been there, but left a few days ago. And he had overheard them say something about a brothel over in the town a few miles away. Dan deduces that their money must have run out, and they must be planning to make some at the brothel. Filled with disgust, Dan makes his way to the brothel. 

On arriving at the brothel, he finds that there is one particular door outside which there's a long queue of men. He asks the pimp about the reason for that. 
Pimp: ""We have only had Mexican prostitutes in our establishment so far. First time ever, a blonde walked in a few days ago and offered herself! Easiest money of my life, everyone's lining up to fuck her!"" 
Dan is incensed because he knows exactly who the fuck is behind that door. 
Dan: ""Did she come in here with a man? Where did the man go?"" 
Pimp: ""Oh yes she came with a guy alright, he just sits inside and collects the money, we split it at the end of the day.""
By this point, Dan has lost it. 
Dan: ""I've come a long way over a long time, searching for that woman and that man. I'm going to fuck them up pretty bad."" 
Pimp: ""I'm sorry, I don't think these men will let you get in the way of their fun."" 
Dan: ""Then I'll beat each and everyone of them up too"".

She lived alone in her small apartment. She put on her nightdress and slippers, then made herself a cup of tea.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just as she was sitting down in front of the TV, the lights began to flicker. Suddenly, the TV went off and the lights went out. She was plunged into darkness. 

&amp;#x200B;

“The power must have gone out,” she thought to herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

She finished her cup of tea, then got a flashlight from the kitchen drawer and went to bed. She was very tired, so she kicked off her slippers and collapsed on the bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her bedroom window was open and the curtains fluttered in the gentle breeze. The moon shone through the window, casting frightening shadows on the wall. Her eyes slowly began to close as she drifted off to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, she heard a loud creak. She opened her eyes and wondered what it was. Perhaps it was just the wind, she told herself. She tried to relax and go back to sleep.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just then, from the kitchen, she heard a loud noise that sounded like dishes being smashed.  

&amp;#x200B;

A hoarse voice whispered, “Tonight, you will die.”  

&amp;#x200B;

The old woman was startled. “Who’s there?” she cried.  

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m going to enjoy killing you,” the hoarse voice replied. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Whoever you are, get out!” cried the old woman. “Leave me alone!” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Die! Die! Die!” whispered the voice.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fear gripped her heart. In a panic, she reached out for the flashlight, but it wasn’t on her bedside table. She tried to find her phone, but she couldn’t remember where she left it. She lay in her bed, gripping the sheets and shaking with fear.  

&amp;#x200B;

“I’ve come here to kill you,” said the voice.  

&amp;#x200B;

The old woman’s pulse was racing and her heart was beating fast. She was so terrified she could barely breathe. She scrambled out of bed and cowered in the corner. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Please!” she begged. “I’m an old woman! I’ve never harmed anyone! I don’t deserve to die!”  

&amp;#x200B;

“There is no escape!” said the voice. “I’m going to kill you slowly and painfully!” 

&amp;#x200B;

Crouching in the corner, the woman could not bring himself to move. She was paralyzed by fear. Her hands were shaking convulsively. Her brain ceased to think properly. The terrifying voice echoed in her head over and over, “Die! Die! Die!”  

&amp;#x200B;

“No, no! Please!” she moaned. “I don’t want to die!”  

&amp;#x200B;

She began beating on the wall with her fists, hoping to wake the neighbors. She tried to get up, but her legs were weak and she fell to her knees. Her breath came in shuddering gasps.  

&amp;#x200B;

“I can’t take it anymore!” she wailed. “If you’re going to kill me, then get it over with! Do it quickly! Put me out of my misery!”  

&amp;#x200B;

Exhausted, the old woman began crawling across the floor to her bedroom door.  

&amp;#x200B;

“Say your prayers,” the voice growled. “You’ll be dead soon.” 

&amp;#x200B;

With her last ounce of strength, the old woman grasped the door handle. She wanted to be brave. She wanted to look her killer in the face before he snuffed out her life. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Prepare to die!” said the voice. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Go ahead, do your worst!” the old woman screamed.

He'd  have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later  the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The  Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He  responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only  one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my  head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing  to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I  pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our  sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He  bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile,  the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't  have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three  days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me  that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we  were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...'  said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.",29

I put my best lizard-healer expression on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little lizards was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do.

“Honey,” I called, “come look at the lizard!”

“Oh, my gosh!” my wife exclaimed. “She’s having babies.”

“What?” my son demanded. “But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!”

I was equally outraged.

“Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn’t want them to reproduce,” I said accusingly to my wife

Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?”she inquired (I think she actually said this sarcastically!)

“No, but you were supposed to get two boys!” I reminded her, (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth).

“Yeah, Bert and Ernie!” my son agreed.

“Well, it’s just a little hard to tell on some guys, you know,” she informed me (Again with the sarcasm!).

By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it.

“Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,” I announced. “We’re about to witness the miracle of birth..”

“Oh, gross!” they shrieked

“Well, isn’t THAT just great? What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little lizard babies?” my wife wanted to know.

We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later.

“We don’t appear to be making much progress,” I noted.

“It’s breech,” my wife whispered, horrified.

“Do something, Dad!” my son urged.

“Okay, okay.” Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gentle tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.

“Should I call 911?” my eldest daughter wanted to know.

“Maybe they could talk us through the trauma.”

“Let’s get Ernie to the vet,” I said grimly.. We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap.

“Breathe, Ernie, breathe,” he urged.

“I don’t think lizards do Lamaze,” his mother noted to him.

The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass.

“What do you think, Doc, a C-section?” I suggested scientifically.

“Oh, very interesting,” he murmured. “Mr. and Mrs.. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?”

I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.

“Is Ernie going to be okay?” my wife asked.

“Oh, perfectly,” the vet assured us. ‘This lizard is not in labor.. In fact, that isn’t EVER going to happen. . .Ernie is a boy. You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um . . um . . . masturbate. Just the way he did, lying on his back.” He blushed, glancing at my wife.

We were silent, absorbing this.

“So, Ernie’s just . just . . . excited,” my wife offered.

“Exactly,” the vet replied, relieved that we understood.

More silence. Then my wife started to giggle. And giggle. And then even laugh loudly.

“What’s so funny?” I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness.

Tears were now running down her face. ‘”t’s just .that . .I’m picturing you pulling on its . … . its. . . teeny little . . ”
She gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.

“That’s enough,” I warned. We thanked the vet and hurriedly bundled the lizard and our son back into the car.. He was glad everything was going to be okay.

“I know Ernie’s really thankful for what you did, Dad.” he told me.

“Oh, you have NO idea,” my wife agreed, collapsing with laughter.","Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was “something wrong” with one of the two lizards he holds prisoner in his room.",7

He says, ""You know, its a shame that you have done so much and can't take it with you. I'm going to do something special just for you.""

He hands the man a briefcase, saying, ""I'm going to give you one day to go back down to earth. You can gather up anything you want, and whatever you can fit in this briefcase you can bring with you into heaven.

As the man is walking around back on earth, he takes a moment to think what he wants to fill the briefcase with. He's drawn to the hundreds of millions of dollars he made over his lifetime, but he knows there's no way it will all fit.

As he's thinking, he passes a store with a huge sign saying ""WE BUY GOLD,"" and he has an idea. If they buy gold, they probably sell it to. ""I can fit a lot more worth of gold in my briefcase than of cash,"" he thinks.

First, he goes to his bank and withdraws all of his money. He then goes to the store and buys out all of the gold they have. The $20 million of gold bars only fills the briefcase a little more than half full. He then hurries over to another store with a ""WE BUY GOLD"" sign and buys them out of the $10 million of gold bars they have.

As the sun begins to set on his last day on earth, the man finds one last store and buys $8 million more of gold bars, filling his briefcase to the brim.

He sits down on the curb to rest, proud of how smart he is, thinking to fill the briefcase with gold, letting him bring $38 million into heaven.

As the last rays of the sun slip below the horizon, he is transported back to the gates of heaven where St. Peter meets him and asks to see what he brought.

Beaming with pride, the man opens the briefcase, showing Peter the rows of gold
