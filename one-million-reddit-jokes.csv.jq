Then she went out on the back porch and gave Ol' Spot (the yard dog) a double handful. Ol' Spot ate every bite. 

All morning long, Janet watched Ol' Spot and the wild mushrooms didn't seem to affect him, so she decided to use them. The meal was a great success, and Janet even hired a helper lady from town to help her serve. She had on a white apron and a fancy little cap on her head. 

After everyone had finished, they relaxed, socialized, and played dominoes. 

About then, the helper lady from town, came in and whispered in Janet's ear. She said, ""Mrs. Williams, Ol' Spot just died."" Janet went into hysterics. After she finally calmed down, she called the doctor and told him what had happened. 

The doctor said, ""That's bad, but I think we can take care of it. I will call for an ambulance and I will be there as quick as possible. We'll give everyone enemas and we will pump out everyone's stomach Everything will be fine. Just keep them calm."" 

Soon they could hear the siren as the ambulance was coming down the road. The EMTs &amp; the doctor had their suitcases, syringes, and a stomach pump. 

One by one, they took each person into the bathroom, gave them an enema and pumped out their stomach. After the last one was finished, the doctor came out and said, ""I think everything will be fine now, and he left.""

Just gotta push past that threshold.

Now we have this threshold broken we just stay here for my entire time and laugh with very little work required. I swear i can just keep talking about this same thing for 5 minutes straight and get everyone in here laughing. The best is when you laugh so hard that you cry.. Just a nice full out laugh, the one where you physically cannot laugh any harder. Just a maxed out laugh, the one where you dont even make a sound. Oh this is fun. (the idea at this point is that im laughing naturally and the crowd is laughing too).

As a business student i learnt about cash flow ratio, which automatically translated to laugh flow ratio for me.

The man makes sure that he dresses extremely nicely so he’s wearing a professionally tailored suit complete with tie and freshly polished shoes.

The pope comes out and begins to bless and shake hands with the people in the line one by one.

The first person comes forward and receives a blessing and so does the second, third and the fourth person. But then the fifth person steps forward and he isn’t dressed like everyone else. He’s homeless and wears a tattered trench coat and his hair is messy. Instead, the pope gives this man a hug. The homeless man exits the line and the next few people step up and they all receive a blessing.

The man sees this and decides that he doesn’t just want a blessing, he wants a hug too. So he leaves the line and finds the homeless man and he says
“I’ll pay you $1000 for that jacket.”
The homeless man happily takes the money and gives the man the jacket. The man puts it on, messes up his hair and rejoins the line. 

The line moves slowly but eventually the man makes it to the front of the line. The pope opens his arms, hugs the man and whispers in his ear,

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates: 

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! 

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: 

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. 

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: 

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 

""That's nice,"" she thinks, ""but I want more."" 
So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: 

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 

""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. 
She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 

""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" 
Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. 

PLEASE NOTE: 

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street. 

The first floor has wives that love sex. 

The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer. 

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

I think there's somebody under it.  
I'm scared. 
I think I'm going crazy."" 
  
""Just put yourself in my hands for one year"", said the psychiatrist. 

""Come, talk to me three times a week and we should be able to get rid of those fears."" 
  
""How much do you charge?"" 
  
'$200 per visit,' replied 
the doctor.     
  
'I'll think of it and if needed I will come back to you,' 
Robert said. 
  
Six months later he met the Psychiatrist on the street.     
 
'Why didn't you come to see me about those fears you were having?' he asked.   
  
'Well, $200 a visit three times a week for a year is an awful lot of money! 

An Indian friend of mine cured me for the price of one plate biryani and a bottle of coke.

I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went and bought myself a new SUV"".

""No thank you,"" says Bill, returning to the Sudoku he is filling out with a crayon. ""All the other inmates have been gossiping about your little job all day, and I want nothing to do with it.""

Confused, the guard persists, ""Bill, seriously man. We need to do some maintenance on the roof, and the warden told me to select a small work complement of our most exemplary inmates to do the job. I've literally only seen this happen in the movies. Don't tell me you're passing up on the chance to get out of this hell hole and feel the sunshine on your face.""

Unimpressed, Bill simply replies, ""I'll pass.""

At this point, the guard is completely bewildered. He gets right up in Bill's face and says, ""Hey, man, what's wrong with you? Any other guy in here would kill to have a shot at an easy work complement like this!""

Annoyed, Bill calmly sets aside his crayon and his sudoku, takes off his glasses, looks the guard in the eye, and replies, ""Haven't you read my file? Roofies are what got me in here in the first place.""

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,157

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.”…

Yes, she says, “I remember it well.”

OK, he says, “How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time’s sake?”

“Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!”

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle, thinks to himself, ""I’ve got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I’ll just keep an eye on them so there’s no trouble."" So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans gingerly against the fence, the old man moves in...

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned a valuable lesson about life and old age that he didn’t know before.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I’ve got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, “Excuse me, but that was something else. You must’ve had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?”

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply, “Fifty years ago that wasn’t an electric fence.”",An elderly couple is sitting in a restaurant.,26

I will hide inside the statue, and when the lion comes, I will shoot him.""

That night the villagers made the replica and put it in the jungle along with the hunter. They waited the entire night and did not hear anything. The villagers went out to look for the hunter and went to the spot where the left him. They saw the statue cracked and on the ground. They looked inside and found the hunter, shaken and tired and brought him out. 

They asked him, ""What happened to the lion?""

He replied, ""To hell with the lion! Who was the son of a bitch who left the bull untied?""

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it.  He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.  Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights.  He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation.

The entire upper section of the tavern has fantastic pairs of tits carved all over, and it is quite a sight to behold.

The man asks the artist, ""is this all your work?""

The artist responds, ""it is. I have dedicated my life to appreciating the bosom of a woman.""

Jokingly, the man says, ""I too appreciate the finer tits in life!""

The artist leans close and whispers, ""then I have a secret to share with you. Every night, the barkeeper's wife waits in bed upstairs with the lights off, waiting for the barkeeper to come in and fuck her. She has the most fantastic set of tits you'll ever see. So, if you wait for the bar to get really busy, you can sneak upstairs and get in bed with her, and she'll be never the wiser.""

The man laughs off such a ridiculous story and goes to sit down. However, the idea tantalizes him, and after an hour the bar starts to get really busy and the barkeeper is run off his feet.

Out of curiosity (and a little help from booze), the man gets up and sneaks up the staircase in the corner. Upstairs he finds a closed door. He turns the handle and peers inside. The room is dark but he can make out a bed with a figure lying in it.

Heart pounding, he goes in, closes the door behind him, crawls into bed, and snuggles up to the woman. She immediately moans softly, and so his puts his arm around her to find a huge pair of bare breasts. He immediately notices they're fake, but he doesn't care. The woman warms up to him quickly and they start making out. Before long, she unzips his pants, and gives him the best blowjob he's ever had.

After finishing, the man feels extremely guilty and admits to the woman, ""I must confess. I am not your husband, I'm so sorry"".

He finds an arena where the bull fighting had just ended, and sees a lot of people filing into a restaurant across the street. 

The young man sits down and begins looking at the menu, when suddenly he hears the sound of music. A man in a tuxedo comes out of the kitchen with a fancy covered plate in hand, followed by another man playing the trumpet.

The man in the tux sets down the plate on a nearby table and lifts up the cover, revealing two large spherical objects. The people at the table immediately begin digging in. 

The young man asks the waiter what those people ordered, and the waiter responds “It’s las bolas del toro, the balls of the bull”.

The young man notes that they look delicious and asks to order them, however the waiter lets him know that there is only one bull fight per day, meaning only one order per day.

The young man requests that he get las bolas del toro the next day, and leaves.

He comes back the following day, after heavily anticipating the meal, to the familiar sound of the ruckus outside of the arena, and the familiar sight of people filing into the restaurant. He excitedly sits down at a table, waits to be served, and tells the waiter he is ready for his meal. 

20 minutes later the sound of music returns, as does the waiter with the covered plate and the trumpet player close behind him. People around the young man cheer and gawk.

The plate is set down on the table, and the cover is lifted. This time, however, there are only 2 small spherical objects on the plate. The young man, outraged, complains to his waiter. “Sir, I ordered las bolas del toro, not whatever the heck this is!”

I rushed out of the balcony door and did not find anyone. As I looked down from the balcony, I saw a man running out and he was dressing himself. I was very angry. I grabbed the fridge and threw it at him. It was very heavy. That was how I strained my back.""

He replied, ""You know I have been unemployed for a while now. Today was the first day at my new job. I forgot to set my alarm and I was late.

The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling.  Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving.  After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely *abhored* his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed.  I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said 

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""  

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework.  Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child.  That name has been in our family line for generations."" 

 Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan.  The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall.  After we arrived, he had gotten the name\-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change.  I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice.  Tears began to stream down his face.  He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved.  The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray\-bans, and an american flag t\-shirt bursted into the room.  Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.  

""D\-D\-Dad?"" 

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

Petrus looks at the nuns and shouts ""Listen up all of you who have served God so well. Before you enter Heaven, you should be free of sin""

The first nun moves towards Petrus and speaks to him softly.

Nun: Forgive me Petrus for I have sinned... While i was working at the Vatican, I... I gave the pope a handjob with my right hand because he asked me to do so... I'm so ashamed now!

Petrus: Don't worry, just wash your right hand in the water and you can freely enter Heaven!

The nun starts washing her right hand, enters the gate and disappears within the light.

The second nun walks toward Petrus and starts talking.

Nun: Oh Petrus, i've heard what the last nun before me did and I have to admit.. I also gave the pope a handjob while I was working at the Vatican, only I used my left hand..

Petrus: Wash your left hand in the waterbucket and you will be freed from sin!

The nun starts washing her left hand and walks through the gate into the light.

The third nun in the queue starts walking forward and approaches Petrus. Suddenly five other nuns hastily leave the queue and start running towards the waterbucket like madmen as one of them shouts:

The tribesmen take the sailors to their chief. The chief, in very broken English, speaks to them,

""You trespass here, now I have test for you. Go deep into forest. Pick for me 3 fruits, and return to me. The test begins then.""

And so the 3 sailors, being watched closely by the tribesmen, do just that. The first sailor returns to the chief with 3 apples. The chief says,

""Time for the test. You take all 3 fruit and 1 by 1 you put them in your bum. You not make any sound, you not make any face. You do this you live. You become one of us. You fail, you lose head.""

The sailor begrudgingly begins the task, realizing it is his only hope to live. He succeeds with the first apple. After a moment of recuperation, he begins once again; he was successful. On the third apple, however, he grimaces. He is met with an immediate and swift death.

The second sailor returns from the forest with 3 cherries. The chief repeats:

""Time for the test. You take all 3 fruit and 1 by 1 you put them in your bum...""

The sailor, content with his choice, begins with the first cherry. Easy. He grabs the second cherry. No problems. He grabs the third cherry. As he's finishing up, he breaks out into laughter. The chief's pleased smile quickly fades and is replaced by a rage filled scorn. He kills the sailor on the spot.

In the afterlife, the first sailor asks the second sailor,

""You were so close!! What happened? Why did you break?!""

The second sailor replies,

""I couldn't help it! I lost it when I saw the third guy coming back with 3 pineapples.""",3 sailors crash their boat while sailing close to the shore of an unexplored island.,39

“We raise chickens too, but we raise them for their eggs,” said the girl. “One time we put our eggs in a basket in the back of our truck to take them to market, but on the way we hit a bump and the basket flew out and all the eggs broke.”

“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket!”

“Excellent,” said the teacher. “We have time for one more story- who would like to share?”

“My dad told me a story about my aunt Becky, who was a pilot in Desert Storm.

So she drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn’t go to waste and when she crash landed there were 100 enemy soldier waiting for her. So she killed 80 with the machine gun until she ran out of ammo, then she killed 10 with the machete till the blade broke off, then she killed the last 10 with her bare hands.”

Somehow this works, and the bear doesn’t leave Jim hanging. Jim decides to call the bear “Steven” before starting on his way out of the forest. A few minutes go by, and Jim turns around to find that Steven has been following him. Still super drunk, he thinks, “Oh, cool. I have a bear friend.” and just keeps on moving. Soon, after seeing how Jim is continually stumbling and faceplanting out of sheer drunkenness, Steven positions himself so that Jim can ride on his back. Jim climbs onto Steven, and Steven takes Jim all the way home.

The next morning, Jim wakes up, thinking that he must’ve dreamed up all of the bear stuff. He soon finds Steven sitting at his front door, so he lets him into the house. Realizing that everything had actually happened, he calls up Matt, his best friend, to tell him about his crazy night.

“Hey Matt!” Jim says.

Later that week he realizes that he might be wrong with his prediction, so he walks into the city and uses a pay phone to call the local weather station.

He asks them, ""Can you tell me if the coming winter will be colder than usual?""

The guy at the weather station says, ""Actually, yes, we have information that the coming winter will be a cold one.""

After hearing this, the Chief goes back to his reservation and tells them, ""This winter will be very cold.  Collect as much firewood as you can.  We need to be prepared for a very cold winter.""

The next week, the Chief goes back into the city and calls the weather station again.  He asks, ""Do you have any updates on how cold this winter will be?""

The guy responds, ""Uhhh, this winter could be one of the most severe we've seen in a long time.  You can expect the conditions to be extreme.  Very cold.""

So the Chief goes back to his reservation and says, ""Every able-bodied man, woman, and child needs to be out collecting firewood!  Collect as much as you can!  Collect wood like your life depends on it!""

Another week goes by and the Chief goes back into the city to call the weather station.  He asks, ""Do you have an update on this coming winter?""

The guy at the station says, ""This is going to be possibly one of the coldest winters EVER on record.  At the very least it's going to be one of the coldest we've seen in decades.""

Her dad looks up, 'I'm sorry honey, with your mom out of town, and without a second vehicle, I wouldn't want something happening to you; and risk an emergency.' 

The girl storms back up stairs- cools off and decides to try again. She heads back downstairs... 'Daddy, can I please, please, have the car tonight? I will do extra chores for a week.' Sensing her desperation, her dad pauses; 'I'm really not comfortable letting you take the car out tonight honey, I am sorry.' 

Growing more and more frustrated, the girl decides to employ all of her resources. 'Daddy, please; this is is the party of the year.. I'll do anything at all, please, just name it, I really need the car tonight'. Again, her dad looks up, raises an eyebrow and says: 'Anything at all?' The girls eyes perk up... ""Yes Daddy! ANYTHING!"" 

Her father looks down at his lap and then back up at his daughter. 'Well, with your mother being gone, I could sure use a blowjob.' 

With disgust, his daughter stares at him. Soon her anger resides and she thinks 'what the hell, fine!'

She gets down on her knees and starts to blow her dad, sucking and stroking... a few licks in, she stops and looks up at her dad with a foul look on her face; 'What the hell dad, your dick tastes like shit!'
