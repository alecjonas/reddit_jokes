Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.
They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and are horrifically executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist like the others.""

""It almost looks like he's waving,"" said the second Alien.

""Let me see,"" said the third Alien. ""Wow! I don't believe it.""

""What?"" Asked the second Alien.

""It's Dave!""",3 Alien leaders are discussing the fate of humans.,13

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Rich, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Rich and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Rich! What's up? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Rich's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Rich that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Rich says.

""Barrack Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Rich says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At his house, Obama spots Rich walking towards his door and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Rich, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Rich, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Rich. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Rich and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Rich says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Rich emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Rich returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Rich asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Rich?'

The finals of the National Poetry Contest last year came down to two finalists. One was a Duke University Law School graduate from an upper crust family; well-bred, well-connected, and all that goes with it. The other finalist was a red-neck from Southeast Tennessee A &amp; M. The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less and the poem had to contain the word ""Timbuktu"". The Duke graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started, he jumped up and recited the following poem: 

Slowly across the desert sand
Trekked the dusty caravan.
Men on camels, two by two
Destination Timbuktu.

The audience went wild!! How, they wondered could the red neck top that?! The clock started again and the red neck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:

Tim and I, off hunting went
Found three girls in a pop-up tent.
They were three, we were two,
So, I bucked one and Timbuktu.",The National poetry contest,18

BUMP

He looks back warily and through the fog sees an upright casket hopping its way down the street toward him.

Terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing after him.

He runs up to his door, fishes out his keys and enters. He slams the door behind him and locks it as quickly as he can. But the casket doesn't stop.

It smashes through his door, and chases him up the stairs. The casket's door is swinging wildly, clapping as it bounces after him.

He rushes into his toilet, and locks himself in again. He's panicking, his heart is racing and he's soaked in sweat. 

Alas, the casket tears through his bathroom door as well. The man reaches out to find something to throw at the casket, and grabs the first thing he gets. 

It's a bottle of cough syrup. Desperate, he throws it at the casket.

Immediately, the coffin stops. ",A man is walking home alone one foggy night...,121

The mother said she would only for the money to put his sister and him through college and to pay off bills. The sister said yes in a heart beat just for the money. So with this information, the boy goes back to his father for an explanation. 

Son: ok dad I asked both mom and sister if they would sleep with another man for a million dollars and they both said yes. 

Father: well there is your answer right there!

Son: I don't get it at all...

Father: well, in THEORY we could have two million dollars, but the REALITY is that we live with a couple of whores!",The difference between reality and theory,7

""get a horse ready, Im in a hurry""

""which one dad?""

""don't care, first one you see""

He takes a shower and rushes out to mount the horse for the trek, since he figures he's running late, he takes a shortcut, a road with a reputation to be haunted.

a few minutes later in the middle of the road, flames and brimstone erupt suddenly and violently as a great, red, horned demon appears before him.

The cowboy is stunned with fear, but the demon calms him down

""hey... hey... Im not here to kill you or anything, sorry about scaring you, listen, its been a while anyone ever comes down this road, so for your bravery, I'll grant you three wishes""

""alright... I want money, infinite money"" stammers the cowboy.

the demon snaps his fingers ""It is done, what else?""

""I-I- I wanna be handsome""

again, the demon snaps his finger and says ""good choice, what else?""

The cowboy now, with a certain smugness taps his mount and says ""I want my genitals to be comparable to my mount's""

The demon raises an eyebrow ""You know, not everyone is into that, right""

""Just do it, come on""

""Fine"" says the demon ""It is done, farewell traveller""

and like that, the demon disappears, The cowboy rushes to the party and finds a mirror in the salon, he notices that while he looks not too different, most of his wrinkless and blemishes in his face disappeared and all the ladies are blushing when they pass by him, slowly, he notices that whenever he spends any money, a 100 dollar bill appears on its place in his wallet.

After a long night of partying, he goes back home to sleep, he wakes up early in the morning and passes by his son eating breakfast.

""So, how was the party?"" his son asks

""It was good, really good"" he says as he walks to the toilet, in order to take a piss.

""Yeah, you look... better, must've been great""

The cowboy doesnt respond, and about 3 minutes later, his son gets worried about the silence.

""Dad... you okay in there?""

""Yeah, son... I think I am, I just got one question""

""go ahead""

Judge: To prove your innocence, you are to cut a fly.

The ninja takes a step back and the assassin steps forward.

All of a sudden, the judge, ninja and assassin notice something fall to the ground from the fly while the fly itself starts buzzing in a much higher pitch.

The rabbi steps back and says: circumcision requires precision.","A ninja, assassin and rabbi are in court",1

Fred tried not to be irritated, but soon the flinching man got on his nerves and he hopped off the train at the next station and ran to the next carriage.

So Fred tried to be tolerant but again the blinking man became too distracting and he hopped into a third carriage at the next station.  To his dismay, Fred sat next to a man who continued to flick his fist toward the floor.  Fred didn't waste time. ""Don't tell me,"" said Fred, ""you picked that up in Afghanistan didn't you!""

Next was Donald Trump. He said: ""I’m the smartest president america has ever had, and I’m loved all over the world."" He took the second chute and jumped out.

The last two were the pope and a 10 year old boy. The pope said to the boy: ""I’m old and don’t have many years left, you’ve got your whole life ahead of you. Also, I’m sure to go to heaven. You take the last parachute, and God be with you.""

The boy replied: ""Thank you for thinking of me, but there is no need for that. The worlds smartest president took my backpack.""

After several weeks providing physical labour to the farmers he asks if there is a more effective way to help them. The farmer replied to him ""Father, it has not rained in months. And when the season returns the rain is so sparse we can barely get our crops to survive"". With some consideration that night, the priest says a quick prayer that night to help the farmers by giving the best season of rain the country had ever seen.

As he woke up the next morning, miraculously it was raining outside. Not only that, it was pouring rain, the most rain the region had ever seen. Within the following months, the crops were plentiful and the area was having an economic revolution.

His work was noted and he was eventually invited to meet the Pope to discuss the change in the region he had brought about, as the Pope was holding a summit for influential priests. He packed his bags without hesitation and jumped on the 12:30 flight to the Vatican to meet his mentor. The day comes and he shakes hands with the Pope, when the Pope asked him ""Father, what contribution have you made to society which brought you here?""

At one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door.  
He took out a business card, wrote 'Revelation 3:20' on the back of it and stuck it in the door.  
When the offering was processed the following Sunday, he found that his card had been returned. Added to it was this cryptic message, 'Genesis 3:10..'

""Hello good sirs, and welcome to the Kingdom of God. In heaven we have but one rule: DO NOT step on a duck.""
""I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?"" questioned one of the men.
""Over the years, many misconceptions of heaven have arose. Yes, it's a pretty nice place. No, its not perfect, but its close. You see the only problem is the ducks. If you step on a duck it will begin to quack and then all the other ducks will begin to quack and its simply a nuisance for us all. So if you step on a duck, you must suffer the consequences."" Saint Peter replied.
The three men looked at each other, laughed it off, and continued into heaven. As far as the eye could see there were ducks everywhere. Almost immediately one of the men accidentally stepped on a duck. Just as Peter had said, the duck began to quack and then the ducks around him began an audible tidal wave of quacks.
Soon after the quacks had passed, Saint Peter approached the men in hand with a hag of a woman. Without a word, he shackled the hag to the man that stepped on the duck and left.
The other two men were careful not to step on a duck. Although they tried there best, one of them eventually stepped on a duck. The same phenomenon of before arose and Saint Peter arrived again with a huge amazonian woman with warts all over her face. He shackled the woman to the man and left.
The final man treaded with care and spent many days and nights successfully stepping around the ducks. After a while, Saint Peter approached the man with a beautiful woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left without a word.
The man was so delighted he audibly said to himself, ""Wow, what did I do to deserve this?""
The woman replied, ""I don't know, but I stepped on a duck...""","Whatever you do, don't step on a duck.",38

As he’s getting in the bed later that night, he hears the voice again saying “quit your job”. Again he thinks nothing of it and goes to sleep. 

When Chuck wakes up he hears the voice again, “quit your job”. He thinks to himself, ok I really need to see a therapist about this voice. 

Chuck gets an appointment with a local therapist later that afternoon. He tells the therapist that he has been hearing a voice that is saying to quit his job.

The therapist says, “Well in situations like this sometimes it’s best to listen to the voice as it is most likely your conscious talking to you.” 

Chuck listens to the therapist and decides to go quit his job. Once he quits his job he hears the voice again, “sell your house”.

He puts his house on the market and it sells the very next day for $200,000. He deposits the money in his account and the voice says, “ go to the airport”.

Chuck drives to the airport. The voice says, “buy a ticket to Vegas”. He again listens to the voice and gets on the first flight to Vegas. 

As he is stepping off the plane the voice says, “go to Caesar’s Palace and head to the roulette table”.

Chuck complies with the voice and walks up to the roulette table. The voice says, “put all of your money on red 34”. 

Chuck places all $200,000 on red 34. The dealer spins the wheel and the ball lands on black 15.

The rabbit eats the toastie, gulps down the barkeep, and with a cheery ""cheers barkeep!"" Walks out of the bar.

The next day the same thing happened again, the rabbit walks into the bar and has the same order. This happens every day for the next few months, and the rabbit is beginning to be a regular at the pub. Until one day the rabbit walks into the bar and asks for the usual only to be told by the bartender that they didn't have any ham left but he could make the rabbit a cheese and onion toastie if the rabbit wanted. 

The rabbit ponders this for a few seconds before agreeing to a cheese and onion toastie.
The rabbit eats down the toastie, gulps down his pint, says cheers to the bartender and leaves.

The next day the rabbit doesn't turn up, and the bartender is a bit worried but thinks nothing of it, maybe the rabbit just didn't fancy a toastie today. That night however, the bartender woke up to a bright light shining in his eyes, and It was the ghost of the rabbit at the end of the bed. 

The bartender immediately starts asking the rabbit what happened as the rabbit was fit and healthy the day before, to which the rabbit replied;
""I had been eating cheese and ham toasties for so long, when you gave me a cheese and onion one, you gave me a case of mixin-ma-toasties""

The engineer notices that a lot of things aren't working and are in dire need of fixing. The air conditioning is busted, the network is overloaded, there's power shortages everywhere, everything is overheating. He mentions this to the little demon and suggests he could try to fix things. He also had a few ideas about redesigning the place to make it more efficient. The demon takes him to Lucifer, and Lucifer is enthusiastic about the whole idea and gives his permission.

A few months later God decides to visit Hell for an inspection. He is greeted by the new renovated Hell and he's absolutely speechless! The corridors are now well lit and properly ventilated. The air conditioning is working and the thermostat is fixed. The elevators are working again. There's no more loud noises of grinding and screeching coming from all the machinery. The lava spill has been contained. All the horrible fumes are now gone and the denizens of Hell use electric cars to travel. There's even a monorail being constructed. The electrical grid has gone geothermal. Cell coverage was full and there was even wifi. Not only that, but several clubs were under construction and there was already a kick-ass pool with attached jacuzzis. Some bulldozers were building a beach and a tropical-themed resort nearby. The condemned souls were enjoying their time playing sports in new gyms, walking in parks, racing with muscle cars, playing video games and doing all sorts of other activities.

God furiously works to Lucifer's office, kicks the door open and walks in

""What the hell is going on here Luci?""

""Well we got an engineer and he fixed the place up for us""

""You can't get engineers. Our contract clearly stipulates that all engineers belong with me in Heaven.""

""Well too bad, I'm not giving him over""

Safe to say, when the whale awoke, he was distraught. He swam and swam, searching everywhere, but to no avail. 'WHERE IS MY SON' he bellowed, disturbing fish everywhere. This distress caught the attention of a wise old sea turtle. 

'I saw your son', said the turtle swimming over to the whale, 'he was kidnapped by krill. I think I can take you to him'

Grateful, the whale accepted this offer, and the pair set out, searching hastily. After many hours of fruitless looking, they came to a large white cloud, and they came to a stop. The turtle looked sombre. 

'I have bad news', he said mournfully. 'The krill have used their surprisingly adequate war skills once again. They have lactated so much, that they have created this giant, impenetrable white cloud. It's so wide, so high, so thick. I'm so sorry, but it's over.'

The whale would not accept this. 'I'll swim through it! He said'

'No', returned the turtle. The milk is bizarrely poisonous for whales. 

'Okay then, we'll wait for it to disperse, then we can go after them again!', the wale countered

'It will take days!' cried the turtle. The cloud is miles wide, and miles thick. There's no hope.

'Alright then, can't I go over it, can't I even look over it?', the whale nearly sobbed in desperation.

The turtle looked him dead in the eye. 'You don't understand. There's no use spying over krill milk'",The scariest and most feared whale in the entire ocean had his son kidnapped by krill... (an original joke),11

Due to a medical condition, he was not allowed to leave the castle nor ever set foot under the sun. All he had for company were the beautiful cornfields at night where they swayed most gracefully under the florescent light of the moon. Each night he wept over the knowledge of a world that he would never be able to explore. His loneliness in him cut so deep that the patch of the cornfield where his tears often fell upon resulted in a corn sprout that grew a deeper shade of yellow and green than the rest. The goddess of the moon who sympathized with the unfortunate prince decided to blessed him with company on his 18th birthday by turning the patch of corn into a fully fledged corn girl. She had hair golden as the sun, skin tender as starch and wore a frock green as the husks itself. She was beautifully striking in stature with a gentle appearance and when she saw the prince in his pain, leaning against the window, she fell instantly in love with him. A steward who saw the transformation happen immediately sent men to help the freezing lass into the castle. There she was treated as a guest of honor and for once the prince found companionship in the corn girl. It wasn't long before they were both madly in love but with his condition, there was little they could do but muck around in the castle. The prince came to realize that relationships required more than just feelings. There were responsibilities and commitment and boy, communication was hard work! Due to a lack of social circle growing up, he realized he was utterly boring and it began to show as he often noticed the corn girl sighing and wistfully looking out the castle windows. He tried in vain to keep her entertained, going as far as to hire an esteemed playwright in the kingdom and a performing troupe who would visit the castle every week. He made them promise to perform their tale in stages so as to keep his true love guessing for the following week's episode. It worked for a while and he saw the boredom fading from her eyes. And yet a week later, due to an illness on the playwright's part, the story, written by the performers appeared to have lost its plot by having a character central to its story killed off. The corn girl was so disappointed she stomped off before the end credits. They had a big fight that night, the prince and his lady. And with that she was gone. Left the poor prince in his sleep. The next morning the prince had the playright and the troupe put to death and called for the corn fields to be burnt. When asked by his trusty steward for an explanation, the prince was heard to have said, ""Apparently it seems, corn flakes and serials are simply highly overrated.""",The prince and the corn (wall of text warning),3

Each day, the person sticks a new sticker on Trump, looking nearly identical to the first, except for one thing: every sticker has a higher price written on it than the last.  
On the first day, the sticker has the number one million on it. Trump peels it off, looks at it, and says “It’s that you think so highly of me!” And tosses it aside.  
A week later, the sticker reads ten million. The president smiles proudly and goes on with his day.  
A month later, the sticker is labeled one billion. During an interview, Trump pulls the man into the view of the camera, and says “This man is my greatest supporter! He will be awarded for so proudly supporting someone as great as me!”  
This goes on. Soon enough, the sticker man has been appointed the President’s right-hand man. And every day, the man puts the sticker on Trump’s suit, each day reading a higher number than the last.  
Then one day, the price drops a bit, but Trump doesn’t notice.  
From there, the number decreases little by little, still going unnoticed by the President.  
Suddenly, the price drops to 100. Trump finally notices this, pulling the sticker man aside and screaming at him. “You’ve committed a great treason against the United States of America and our nation’s great president! What do you have to say for yourself?!”  
The man calmly replies “Your value hasn’t changed at all. It was simply inflation that made the numbers rise. And as I observed, the inflation not only affected the numbers, but also your ego.”  
“Yes, and so?!” The president yells, furious.  
The man continues “I was hypothesized that the deflation of the price would do the same thing, look at how wrong I was.”

Somewhere in the middle of nowhere his car starts to sputter, steam billows from the hood and the car comes to a stop on the edge of the road.

As he gets out he inspects the car and comes to the conclusion that he's SOL without a mechanic and decides to walk. After a couple hours of seeing nothing but desert in all directions he eyes some farn animals and a small homestead in the distance. As he approaches the farm he can clearly make out the form of a person. He runs with joy up to the man and can now see that he's an elderly Mexican gentleman.

He approaches the man, asks for some water and is granted it. After explaining what happened and receiving some responses of understanding in broken English, he looks over the nearby fence and sees a strong looking work horse pulling a plow. He looks to the man and says ""Sir, is that your horse?""

The elderly man offers an affirmative nod and is met with another inquiry.

""Sir, will you sell me that horse? I could use it to ride to a nearby town and get a mechanic to fix my car.""

The Mexican man takes a second and says ""No, no. I can not sell. That horse no look so good.""

""What do you mean?"" The businessman replies. ""I can see from here that he's a healthy, strong horse. Let me buy him from you."" 

The Mexican man again responds with ""No, I no sell. That horse no look so good. Is bad horse.""

The man, insistent at this point says ""I'll give you all the money in my pocket, two thousand dollars for that horse.""

The Mexican man stops and thinks for a second, putting his finger to his chin and finally says ""O.k. I sell you horse."" 

The two make the exchange and the man rides off into the distance on the horse.

Six hours go by and the sun is beginning to set when from the west, silhouetted by the setting sun, the Mexican farmer can see the outline of a person making his way towards the farm. As he approaches, he recognizes the businessman who bought his horse. The man approaches the farmer, bloodied, clothes torn and very angry looking. He struts up to the Mexican man and says

""What the hell you backwater prick, that stupid horse walked itself with my ass on it right off a cliff right after I left with it!""

The Mexican looks the man in the eye and says 

""I try to tell you! The horse no look so good!""

He goes home in his broken down car to break the news to his wife only to find out that she's been cheating on him with his extremely successful best friend. ""Thats it"" he thinks and jumps out his window. Unfortunately he lands on his car and survives. As a last ditch effort he reaches into his pocket to pull out his gun, but instead, he accidentally pulls out his phone to see that he's recieved a message from a good friend of his. The message reads ""i heard that you lost your job, why don't you come down to rome. I'll introduce you to my boss, and maybe we can get you some work"". The man, pumped up with newfound hope, grabs the first ticket he can find and travels all the way down to italy. On the way there, his plane breaks down and crashes on a deserted island. The man however, does not let this stop him and swims untill he sees a boat which carries him to italy. He then grabs a ride in the back of a broken down European car. Finally after hours of travel he reaches the hotel that his friend is staying at and asks the lady at the front if his friend is in, she replies ""no, but he was expecting you. He's just gone down to that public congregation in town"". Not wanting to wait the man goes down to the congregation where he sees his friend's boss, who's staring at the stage where for some odd reason is friend is standing with the pope. He walks over to the boss with nervous energy. Wanting to make a good first impression, he thinks of something funny to say. So he says "" who the fuck is that standing on the stage with dave"".

The man agreed and the Golf Fairy disappeared.  He finished his round well under par, playing the best golf of his life.  Soon, he was winning pro-am tournaments, and got his picture on the covers of Golf Digest and Sports Illustrated.  Clearly, he was the best golfer in the world!

Until exactly one year later, he was at the same golf course where it had all began, and he sliced his tee shot deep into the thicket of trees again.  He was surprised he had hit such a bad shot, and went deep into the trees to find his ball.

Once again, the Golf Fairy appeared to him.  ""So, how was this last year of golf?""

The man answered, ""Oh, it was the best in my life.  Everything you said about it was true.  Thank you.""

The Golf Fairy asked, ""Okay, so how was your sex life?""

The man looked down and said, ""Not bad.""

The Golf Fairy looked surprised.  ""Oh really?  How many times did you have sex last year?""

The man answered, ""Twice.""

The Golf Fairy started mocking him.  ""Twice?  In a year??  You call that 'not bad'???""

News spreads about the son’s passing and the father is being charged with child negligence. During his highly televised court trial, the prosecutor asks the father, “How could you have been so careless, how could you have not known you needed to aid and medicate your son?!”

The man, pumped up with newfound hope, grabs the first ticket he can find and travels all the way down to italy. On the way there, his plane breaks down and crashes on a deserted island. The man however, does not let this stop him and swims untill he sees a boat which carries him to italy. He then grabs a ride in the back of a broken down European car.

The people there told him: 

""Sir, if you want to bury her back in the United States, it's going to cost you $5,000 to bring back her corpse. But since she died at the hotel, we can do the funeral here in Israel for free.

The man immediately refused and said he would pay the $5,000 fee to do the funeral back home.

When in the USA, his wife came up to him and said: 

""I really love what you just did for my mom. That proves me that you actually loved my mother and you respected her""

Man: Babe, are you crazy?! Those Israelis are the same people who buried Jesus and three days later he came back to life. I'm not about to take that risk with your mother.
