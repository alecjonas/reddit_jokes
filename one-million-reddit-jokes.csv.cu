He was duly processed, stripped, washed and given his prison garb and taken to his cell. 

His cellmate was a giant of a man - seven foot tall, built like a brick shithouse, muscles in places most people don't have places and an obviously enormous packed lunch. He was a scary looking motherfucker, tattooed and scarred. ""Hey - welcome to your new home,"" he said softly, ""we'll get on just fine.""

Our new inmate was suprised that his cellmate wasn't as mean or bad as he looked, so set about trying to make the most of his new life, stowing his meagre possessions and getting used to the din of all the men and trying to make his bunk comfortable. 

During the day, they talked and got to know one another. Both seemed to make friends with each other so easily. The giant was so helpful, giving advice about how to adapt to life in porridge. This seemed like a fairly good situation in a bad place. 

Finally, night came and so did lockdown. Lights out and quietness fell heavily on the wing. 

The big fella hoarsely whispered, ""We get lonely without women in here. Sometimes we fool around, you know? It's just one of those things. Nothing to it. Just relief. You feel me?""

Terror fell on our hero. His heart was pounding, he was sweating. He had noticed the trouser snake his cellmate was packing. His arse clenched, his balls ascended heavens high and his willy looked like a second belly button. Fear possessed his entire being. There was no way out - the cell was locked and no one to turn to for protection. 

The giant guy whispered, ""This is going to happen, one way or another. You're new, so I'll take it easy on you. I'll make you a deal. You wanna be daddy or mommy?""

Relief flowed throughout the newly incarcerated man's body and mind. He wasn't going to suffer that worst of indignities after all. He managed to stutter, ""I'll be daddy, thanks"", wiping the sweat from his brow.

“I bought a mosquito net in case our roof blows away. I can also use it to catch fish in the retention pond out back. These are the times we must be tough so we can persevere and see this thing through. To see if we're made of stronger stuff.”

""Well, my teacher sent me to the principal, the principal sent me to the superintendent, the superintendent sent me to the mayor, the mayor sent me to the governor, the governor sent me to the senator, the senator sent me to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State sent me to the Vice President, and the Vice President sent me to the President, and the President sent me out of the country because I don't like peanut butter,"" Johnny said.

""What!"" Exclaimed the pilot, ""that is not okay. You need to get off of my plane.”

So the pilot gave Johnny a parachute and made him jump out of the plane, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and as he was getting close to the ocean, Johnny released the parachute. He fell some more, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, until eventually he landed in the ocean. 

Knowing that his only chance of survival was to get to land, Johnny detached the parachute and looked around to see if there was any land nearby. Luckily, he saw a beach on the horizon and started to swim towards it. He swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam for what felt like hours until eventually he got to the land.

Upon getting out of the water, he saw that there was a road going along the beach with a sign on the other side that said “Peanut butter free zone.” Finally, Johnny would be free of the condiment that had ruined his life! In his excitement, Johnny ran across the road and got hit by a truck and died. 

The moral of this story is: always look both ways before you cross the street.",Johnny was in class one day when his teacher asked each student to say one thing they didn't like.,0

He sees that this is a woman and, as he catches up to her on a par 3, that, in fact, she's very attractive. He's interested and suggests that they play the rest of the round together. She agrees and a very close match ensues. She turns out also to be a very talented golfer and she wins their little competition on the last hole. He congratulates her in the parking lot then offers to give her a lift when he sees she doesn't have a car. All in all it's been a highly enjoyable morning. 

On the way to her place, she thanks him for the morning's company and competition and says she hasn't enjoyed herself so much on the course for a long time. ""In fact,"" she says, ""I'd like you to pull over so I can show you how much I appreciated everything."" He pulls over, they kiss and she gives him the best oral sex he's ever had. 

The next morning he spies her at the first tee and suggests they play together again. He's actually quite competitive and slightly peeved that she beat him the previous day. Again they have a magnificent day, enjoying each other's company and playing a tight, competitive round of golf. Again she pips him at the last, again he drives her home and again she shows her appreciation. 

This goes on all week, with her beating him narrowly every day. This is a sore point for his male ego but, nevertheless, in the car home from their Friday afternoon round, he tells her that he has had such a fine week that he has a surprise planned: dinner for two at a fancy candle-lit restaurant followed by a night of passion in the penthouse apartment of a posh hotel. Surprisingly, she bursts into tears and says she can't agree to this. 

He can't work out what the fuss is about but eventually she admits the reason. ""You see,"" she tearfully sobs, ""I'm a transvestite."" He is aghast. He swerves violently off the road, pulls the car to a screeching halt and curses madly, overcome with emotion. ""I'm sorry,"" she repeats. ""You bastard,"" he screams, red in the face, ""You cheating bastard. You've been playing off the women's tees all week!!""",A fellow has a week off and decides to play a round of golf every day....

So, back in the middle ages, before we realized cows could give meat and we just knew they could give milk, right? There was this really dumb farmer that was tending to his cows. So, he let them to pasture and they ended up finding a patch of marijuana, right? So they ate it all because the resin was sweet, and the ended up getting REALLY stoned, just completely wasted. Remember, this is the middle ages so we didn't really understand anything medically. So the farmer walks out to check on his cows and sees them all tumbling around and acting foolish and he panics. So he goes and grabs his pitchfork and walks back and starts stabbing the fuck out of them. Just kills each and every one of them. When his wife saw, she runs out and says ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" And he turns and says....

“I cannot, father.”

“You are not ready.”

Years went by and the father grew older as the boy grew stronger. One morning, the father entered the boy’s room and asked, “Can you build this?” and the boy replied, “I must try.” To this response the father only nodded and left the room. The boy packed his few belongings and left soon after. 

The boy then travelled north to work with many other boys from many other small villages. There the boy worked building a great wall to defend the kingdom from outside invaders. He worked hard, slept very little, driven to be able to answer his father’s question. Weeks, then months, then years passed. One by one the other builders perished under the harsh working conditions. Finally, only the boy remained. He worked night and day until he finished constructing the wall as far as he could see to the east and to the west. Once he was finished, he returned home. 

When the boy returned home, his father, now an old and frail asked, “Can you build this?” to which the boy replied, “I can and I did, father.” The father nodded, collapsed and died.

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was a man who drove trains for a living,32

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day her grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put his daughter to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, ""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day her grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later, when the girl was going to bed, the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could survive until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

After the surgery, he looked better than ever! His entire family was amazed, but none of them ever learned where the skin came from; they assumed it was his own. 

One night John is overcome with emotion so he begins to cry and tells his wife ""I love you so much. I'm so grateful for your sacrifice."" 

She shrugs and says ""Honey, all of the thanks I need comes when your mother kisses you on the cheek.""",John's face was burned in an accident,14

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the Chairman of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the customer is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the Chairman's office.

The chairman of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, ""£165,000"". The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.

The chairman was surprised and asked, ""What kind of bets?""

The elderly woman replied, ""Well, I bet you      £25,000  that your testicles are square.""

The chairman started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the chairman and said, ""Would you like to take my bet?""

""Certainly"", replied the Chairman. ""I bet you £25,000 that my testicles are not square.""

""Done"", the elderly woman answered. ""But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness."" ""No problem"", said the chairman of the Bank confidently.


That night, the chairman became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the chairman's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the £25,000 bet made the day before that the chairman's testicles were square.

The chairman confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his trousers etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.

The chairman was happy to oblige.

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the chairman if she could touch them. ""Of course"", said the chairman. ""Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.""

The elderly woman did so with a little smile.

Suddenly the chairman noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, ""Oh, it's probably because I bet him £100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the Chairman of the Bank of England !""",The old lady and the bank,29

Pretty soon, the destination of his elevator-ride is showing up on the display: ""Hell"" 

""Well"", the man thinks, ""I've had a good life. Fair's fair I guess."" 

The elevator opens and to his surprise hell isn't all fire and brimstone - it's a lush meadow with a pleasant blue sky and a small man in a white suit waiting for him, a beaming smile on his face. 

""Excuse me"", the man asks, ""I think I'm at the wrong place."" 

""No, no, I assure you, this is alright"", the man in the white suit says. ""This is indeed hell. And yes, I am the Devil."" 

The man is surprised but decides not to question it. Instead he asks: ""Can I have a look around?"" 

""Feel free"", the Devil encourages him. 

So the man walks around and finds hell to be rather pleasant. People sitting at swimming pools, laughing, talking, enjoying what seems to be the best food afterlife has to offer. But after a while, he notices a huge wall in the distance. Curious, he approaches and finds that the wall seems to be stretching infinitely in both directions. He follows it for a while and eventually spots a crack which he looks through. 

On the other side, it's hell in the worst sense: Fire is everywhere. People are screaming in agonizing pain as red-hot hooks are pierced through their skin. They are boiled alive, every bone in their body gets broken and demons of all shapes and sizes laugh at their pain. Struck with horror, the man turns around to run but freezes as he sees the Devil standing behind him. 

""What's up with that wall?"", the man asks in horror. 

""Oh, that"", the devil says offhandely. ""That's the Christians. It's the way they want it.""",A man dies and finds himself in an elevator,15

Moments later, another young lady, prettier than the last, walks into the bar, and they confer between themselves and decide she deserves a 9.

Many years before, Jacques had helped place all his friends and family into cryogenic sleep. He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”

Jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”",The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,3

A couple days later, the replacement priest is hearing confessions. The first person comes in and tells him that he has stolen from a friend. Sure enough, when he looks at the chart, he finds theft and tells the man to say 2 Hail Marys. 

The next person comes in and confessed to the priest that she has lied to her boss. The priest looks on the chart and finds lying, and tells the woman to say one our father. 

Later on, a woman comes in and tells the priest that she performed oral sex on her boyfriend. The priest is looking on the chart but can’t find oral sex anywhere on there. He begins to panic and opens to door where he sees one of the altar boys walking past. 

He calls him over and asks him what father usually gives for oral sex.

The altar boy says “usually two candies and a soda.”",A priest is going on vacation,113

God tells him, “Now, Bill, you lived an extraordinary life. The products you made helped many people. However, there were also some debacles like Windows 95. I’m unsure whether to send you to Heaven and Hell. This is why, I’ve decided that for the first time in eternity, I am going to let you choose.”

Bill Gates replies, “That will do just fine. Just take me to Heaven and Hell and I can choose for myself.” God obliges. First they visit Heaven. Heaven is beautiful, a true sight to behold. Bill is amazed. There is every type of food imaginable, and beautiful women everywhere! However, he notices that there is no wine or alcohol. He asks God why this is. God tells him, “My son, it is seen as a sin to consume alcohol, and after all, this is heaven.”Bill thinks about this and decides it makes sense, although he is clearly disappointed. 

Four hours in, and Bill is getting bored, so he decides to start chatting up a woman. He talks to her a little bit and asks if she wants to go back to his place. She gasps and says, “Absolutely not! This is the Lord’s Palace! Sex before marriage is prohibited here!” 

Bill is quite annoyed at this point and decides he has had it with Heaven. He finds God and tells him, “God, I want to see Hell.” God willingly acquiesces. He snaps his fingers and suddenly, they appear in Hell. Bill looks around and sees copious amount of alcohol flowing in rivers. He realizes that women, even more beautiful than the ones in Heaven are leading men back to their homes. Bill, without thinking twice says, “I want to go to Hell!” God acquiesces. 

Two weeks pass. 

God decides to check on how Bill is doing. He goes down to Hell to check on him. When he gets there he finds Bill horribly tortured and nailed to a massive cross. Bill, upon seeing God, screams, “How the hell could you do this to me? Hell is nothing like you showed me!

So every week he’d write down a new joke on posters and put them in as many places as possible. One day, however, he put up a joke that someone didn't like, and in the middle of the night, they tore every single joke down. The next day, the man went around town and saw all of his jokes on the ground, causing him to into fall into extreme depression, and for a while, he refused to leave his house.

Eventually, he managed to get back on his feet. While he was walking around, he noticed that the same joke was put back up in all of the usual spots. Later, a former criminal noticed the old man and introduced himself as the guy who replaced all of the posters.

Stunned at the revelation, the old man asked “Why would a person like you help me at one of the lowest points of my life?”

To which the ex-con replied “I think your joke is hilarious, and after not seeing it up for two days, I thought it would be good karma to repost it.”",There was once an old man who loved telling jokes,6

First, she tried moving to Canada. With its liberal social policies, and accepting populace, it seemed the perfect place. But the very first night in the hotel, she made a call to the manager to request additional towels, and the call ended with ""Have a good night, Mr. Ita."" Taking that as a sign that Canada was not the place for her, she booked a flight to leave early the next morning.

So she tried going to the United States, which had made some strides recently in LGBT rights. But let's be honest, the US is kind of a dumpster fire right now, what with the Nazis and such, so she moved on.

Finally she flew to Cuba, just to sit on the beach and escape from everything. Everyone in Cuba was so kind, so accommodating, and addressed her respectfully. She even went out without any makeup, and still, everyone went out of their way to use her new pronouns. 

After two weeks, she contacted a local realtor and said she wanted to buy a house.

""Why would you want to stay here, when you could live anywhere in the world?"" asked the realtor.
