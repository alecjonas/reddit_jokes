Explaining that he had to make a full report of the situation to the authorities he quickly slipped on the parachute and jumped.

The scholarly gentleman stood up next and explained that he had studied at Oxford, Harvard, Yale and other such schools and that he was one of the most intelligent persons in the world. He said that the world needed his wisdom and great learning. So he grabbed a parachute and jumped.

The pastor considered his age and the fact that he had lived a full life and told the boy that he should use the last parachute. The boy scout calmly said, ""Don't worry, we'll both be okay. The most intelligent person in the world just put on my backpack before he jumped.""","4 people, 3 parachutes, one plane about to crash.",12

Things were great for the colony there. They had lots of food and no one around to bother them. Everyday the ants would go out and collect food for the queen then relax and cool off in the stream. But one day when the ants got back from collecting food the stream seemed a little smaller than the day before. At first the ants were worried but then they decided that there was plenty of water to go around anyway. So days passed and the stream kept getting smaller and smaller until one day the stream bed was completely dry. The ants were of course concerned and so they asked their queen for guidance. To their alarm the queen had become very very ill due to dehydration. So the ants decided to send a party out to find something for the queen to drink. The ants went north searching under ever rock and leaf looking for something to save their queen. They marched on and on for what felt like years and finally came across an overturned soda can. “Finally something to save our queen we’re saved.” hollered the ants but as they approached they noticed a long line of bees at the soda can. One brave ant approached a bee and inquired if they might have some soda for their dying queen. “Sorry kid can’t you see there’s a line, if we let everyone with a sob story through we’d have chaos.” Said a burly bee. The ants conversed with each other but finally they decided the line was too long for them at the soda can so they foraged on. Further north the ants pushed through heavy winds across dangerous mountain passes until the ants felt as if they were about to collapse. But just as they thought they could walk no further one ant spotted a water bottle in the distance. The ants scurried over to it, more cautious this time so they wouldn’t get there hopes up again. As they got closer the ants noticed a long line of lady bugs. The brave ant approached and asked a nice looking lady bug. “Excuse me ma’am but may we take some water to our queen she is very sick.” Said the brave ant. “I’m sorry little ant,” said the Lady bug “but can’t you see we’re waiting to swim in that water so we can’t let you take it.” The ants were crushed but the brave ant told all of his friends, “we can keep going and we must keep going for our queen.” So once again the ants pushed ahead. For days and nights they marched through the beating desert sun and frigid moonlit nights they marched. Finally they came upon the strangest thing. They saw a large picnic of bugs all having a merry time just at the edge of forrest. As they approached the brave ant noticed a large bowl of red koolaid.

They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realizing that he just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500. He is amazed, and he says, 'I suppose a blow-job is $1,000?'

The hooker replies, '$1,500.'

'I wouldn't pay that for a blow-job!'

The hooker replies, 'Step over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that's worth every cent of $1,500.'

The guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car and says, 'Sign me up.'

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it but he feels he truly got his money's worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker,' How much for some pussy?'

The second stage was giving the robots a perfectly humanoid stucture and give them the ability to perfectly copy human actions.  
  
The third was making them combat ready.   
   
The final stage involved making the robots make more robots.  
     
The robots made in the first stage were called Alpha generation. All robots were coloured in red-yellow gradient, the colours of the Soviet flag.  
  
 The first robot Alpha-A was so crude it couldn't be controlled once it went outside its range of 14kms. By the time the last robot in the generation was made, remote control technology had been so improved, a person in Moscow could control a robot as long as it was inside the Kuiper belt.    
  
The first robot of generation Beta, Beta-A, had wheels for legs and claw machine for arms. By the time Beta-Z was made the robot was so  humanoid, it could browse reddit while taking a shit while at work.  
  
By this time the Soviet Union had already fallen apart and the cold war was over. But the plans didn't change, though the gradient the robots were painted in changed to the colours of the Russian flag.   
    
The Beta genaration robots were so bad with guns, they could aim at the ground and still miss. But by the time the third stage was over and Gamma generation was perfected, they could hit a humming bird's tail feather while riding a roller coaster.   
   
To make the robots make more robots the fourth generation of robots were trained at the factory where mass production had started. The first robot Delta-A was only good enough to screw nuts and bolts and spray paint the gradients in the assembly line.  
  
 As more advanced robots were produced, they were given more advanced roles in the production process. Delta-X was so advanced, it was given the job of designing Delta-Y. Delta-X did such a great job, Delta-Y was said to be the best robot that had ever been made in factory.  
  
It was so versatile, it was given jobs in military, hospitals, as a teacher and at one point, the job of painting the gradients in the assembly line, because we all know, `Delta-Y by Delta-X gives the gradient at a point in a line.´",At the peak of the cold war the Russians started a project to mass produce war robots.,6

For their new research, several sociologists have designed a device that registers every expletive used in the immediate vicinity to determine how often swearing words are used by different social groups. The device had a radial screen with arrows, so the sociologists figured it would be most efficient to put it in a popular US bar by replacing a wall clock with it. After everything was set, the experiment began.

A group of Swedish guys walk in this bar, have some drinks and walk out after about an hour. The device shows '0 expletives'.  
A group of Chinese guys walk in, have a drink and walk out. The device reads '2 expletives'.  
A group of Germans walk in, have some sort of a party and walk out after several hours. The device shows '10 expletives'.  
A group of Americans walk in, have drinks and walk out. The device reads '15 expletives'.  
A group of Irish guys walk in, have drinks and walk out after several hours. The device reads '25 expletives'.  
A group of Russians walk in, have multiple drinks and after 5 hours they do **not** leave. Time passes and after a couple more hours the sociologists begin to wonder what is going on. They come in and notice that the device is missing and the Russian guys are still there having drinks. Then this dialogue takes place:  
***The sociologists:*** Hey, guys... Erm...What happened to the device on the wall? You know, the one that looked like a wall clock?  
***One of the Russian guys:*** You mean that weird superpowered electric fan? It's over there. We had to unplug it: it nearly blew our first vodka bottle away!",A good Russian joke about Russians :),10

he slipped. When he slipped, the fence split him in
half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half
of Don survived! Each half got up, started hopping
away, and essentially started living separate lives.

The left half, more prone to rational thought, spent
most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting
gig. The right half, more creative, picked up painting,
and taught pottery at the local community college.

On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the
townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both
halves of Don at the same place. Indeed, nobody
could think of even one occurrence of this happening.

Now one day, half a man walks into a bar. The left
half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local
watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of
whisky, which the bartender poured for him

At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down,
asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which
nodded back. As the bartender poured him the beer,
the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to
cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02.

The bartender was astounded-- he was the first
person to see the two halves interact since the
accident. As it dawned on him how rare this was, the
bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted: 

""Whole Don here for just one minute!""

One day, my parents got into an argument about the seating arrangements. The argument ended when dad called mom a bitch, and mom retorted by calling him a bastard. Not knowing what those words meant, I went and asked my mom “What does bitch and bastard mean?” Clearly flustered, mom replied “Bitch is a fancy word for lady and bastard means gentleman.”

Satisfied with the answer I went into our lounge to help grandma with cleaning. She stubbed her toe and said “Shit!” I asked her, what shit means. Pausing for a bit, she confidently told me “Shit, is a fancy word for carpet.”

On the day of the party, I was helping mom cook. She burnt herself while cooking the chicken and yelled “Fuck!” I asked “Mom, what does Fuck mean? She replied “Sweetie, Fuck is just a fancy word for cooking.”

Then I went to watch dad shave. Unexpectedly, he cut himself while shaving and said “Ah, Testicles.” I asked him what testicles meant. Flustered, he replied “Uhh, testicles is just a fancy word for beard”

Then everyone started arriving. I gathered everyone in the lounge and tapped my glass with a spoon 3 times. When I finally got everyone’s attention I welcomed them by saying,

“Good afternoon Bitches and Bastards, please wipe your feet on the shit. My mom is fucking the chicken and my dad is shaving his Testicles.”",The Party,9

&amp;#x200B;

In preparation, he goes to the phone book and looks up a local music teacher. He calls him up and says  


""Hey, I saw that you teach musical instruments, and I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but the issue is, I'm a horse. Can you help me?""  
The music teacher says, ""Not a problem, I've taught many animals to play instruments before, this'll be nothing.""

&amp;#x200B;

After months of practice, the Horse gets really good at guitar.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse soon realizes that the music video had 4 people in it, and to recreate it, he would need help from his friends.

So he calls up his friend Duck and says, ""Duck, I saw this really cool music video on line that I want to recreate. I learned how to play guitar and I want you to learn the keyboard.""

&amp;#x200B;

Sure enough, Duck gets the contact information from Horse of the man who taught him to play guitar and calls him up.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi, I heard that you taught my friend Horse how to play guitar, and I was wondering if you could teach me how to play keyboard? There's an issue though, I'm a duck.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man replies ""Sure! I taught Horse to play guitar, surely I can teach you how to play keyboard.""  


After a few more months of lessons and practicing, Horse and Duck are really good at guitar and keyboard.

&amp;#x200B;

Remembering that they needed 4 people, they called up their friend Cat.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey cat, we need more people to recreate this music video and we want you to learn how to play drums,"" so Cat calls the music teacher and says, ""Hey, I wanna learn drums, I know you taught Horse to play guitar, and Duck to play keyboard, and I'm a cat. Can you help?""  


The teacher says, ""Sure! I can teach any animal to play any instrument.

&amp;#x200B;

As figured, the three animals are practicing and taking lessons and they all get very good at their instruments.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, they realized they needed a fourth person for their band, so they call their friend pig and give him the rundown.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse calls him and says, ""Pig look, the three of us can all play the guitar, drums, and keyboard, now we just need you to play bass,"" so of course, pig calls the music teacher and says, ""Hey, I wanna learn how to play the bass, I know you taught Horse to play guitar, and Duck to play keyboard, and Cat to play the drums, and I'm a pig. Can you help?""\\

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course!,"" he says. ""I can teach any animal to play any instrument.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been around a year at this point, and the animals are finally ready to recreate the music video.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse sets up the recording equipment at his house, and they successfully recreate the music video and upload it to the internet, and it is a HUGE hit.

&amp;#x200B;

After millions of views on their now viral music video, they get a call from a talent agency. They schedule a meeting, and at the meeting, the manager says, ""Guys look, you're 4 animals who can all play instruments and sing, you are obviously very intelligent and we want to send you on tour.""  


The animals are ecstatic, and accept the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

After just a few short months of the 4 animals being on tour, they are very popular.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, while on tour, Horse gets a phone call from the manager.  


""Horse, look. We just received word that your grandmother is in the hospital dying and we think it'd be best if you flew back home to see her."" Horse regretfully obliges and has his understudy fill in for him while he's gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse gets to the hospital back home to find that his beloved grandmother is already dead, with no known final words or will.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse is devastated, after flying back all that way for her to just be dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Horse has been sitting in the hospital for a couple hours at this point, trying to help as he can with the issue at hand. In the middle of the chaos, Horse gets another phone call from his manager.

&amp;#x200B;

""Horse, look. I heard that your grandmother just died and I'm very sorry, but I have more tragic news. The tour bus with all of your friends, roadies, and understudies has flipped and no one survived. I'm very sorry.""  


Horse is obviously in hysterics at this point, and is on the verge of going mad. After he calms down, and some time passes, horse decides to head to a local club to take his mind off of things.

&amp;#x200B;

The horse walks into the club, walks up to the bar, and the bartender says, ""Hey Horse, why the long face?""

So after some thinking the couple decide in favor of the safer low track, but even so, as they are crossing the mountains, the wife falls behind at some point, and just disappears. The husband is heartbroken and the whole party searches for her, but to no avail. So, after several days, completely exhausted, he comes back to Paris. Although the search is ongoing, he’s convinced his wife is dead, so as homage to her, he decides to go look at this one French painter she loved. And lo and behold; who but his wife is standing in front of one of the paintings! 

So he embraces her from behind and says into her ear with a mixture of love and exasperation:

&amp;#x200B;

In a dusty one-street Old West town — the kind of place with muddy roads, one hotel, two whorehouses, and three saloons, all on the same block — there's a bartender who's new to town, only been there a couple days and felt lucky to find this job at a place where there are some pretty saloon girls and a great piano player. This is his second day tending bar, and by late afternoon there are a couple dozen patrons in the joint.

When the piano player takes a break to hit the head and the place seems quiet for a moment, the bartender hear mad hoofbeats outside, and pokes his head through the swinging doors to see a guy on a horse, galloping full-speed into town. The horse if frothing at the mouth, and a the guy rides up to the saloon, not even bothering to hitch the poor beast, and as he hops off, the horse drops dead from exhaustion.

This guy pushes past the bartender into the saloon, and hollers, ""Everybody! Get out of town! Big Ed's a-comin'!""

Everyone in the bar — everyone — jumps up like they were shot out of a gun, making for the door so fast tables get turned over in the process, and the bartender hears many voices outside yelling to everyone else in town, ""Big Ed's a-comin'! Big Ed's a-comin'!""

The rider asks for a glass of water, chugs it, then hurries for the door, and the bartender grabs his arm, saying, ""Who is Big Ed? What's the story? Why is everyone so scared?"" The guy replies, ""I don't have time to explain it to you, kid. Big Ed's a-comin'! I'm getting out of here!"" He pulls his arm away, bolts out the door, and runs down the street trying to find a horse or a ride.

Even though it's been only minutes, the bartender can see the entire town is already getting gone. Horses, buggies, stagecoaches, and wagons are leaving so fast the place feels like a ghost town within 30 minutes.

But the bartender figures, whoever this Big Ed guy is, he's probably going to be thirsty, and why would he be a threat to one lone bartender in an empty town? Plus, he doesn't have a horse so he'd be running on foot to who-knows-where. So he decides he'll stay put.

For the next hour he cleans up the saloon, putting tables upright, cleaning glasses, wiping down the bar...and then he hears it. It sounds like a cross between very heavy, slow hoofbeats and *thunder*. He goes outside and looks up and down the road but can't make out anything, but something is kicking up a cloud of dust maybe a mile down the road into town. He knows the saloon owner has a spyglass he keeps in the office (in his youth the owner had been first mate on a merchant ship), so he heads inside to get it, and notices the bottles behind the bar are all rattling from the rumbling ground. He finds the spyglass, heads outside, looks through it down the road and sees...a huge fucking *elephant* being ridden hard and fast (and steered by its ears) by a mean-looking, hulking bad-ass — wearing bandoleers across his chest, rifles across his back — who so big he makes the elephant look like it's the size of a horse.

Holy shit. Staying here was a mistake. It's too late now. The giant and his elephant are on the edge of town before the bartender can even get his wits about him.

As bartender backs through the swinging doors, and heads trembling behind the bar, the elephant thunders up to the saloon, shaking the whole empty town. The bad-ass hulk of a man jumps down from the elephant — BOOM! the ground shakes! — and ties the elephant to the hitching post *by its trunk*. As he walks up the couple steps to the boardwalk, the wood cracks under his weight. He storms into saloon and up to the bar, and says in a voice like thunder and gravel, ""GIMME A WHISKY!""

Still trembling, the bartender grabs a glass and a bottle, and tries to pour, but he's so scared he's forgotten to take out the cork. The giant swipes the whisky bottle from his hand, bites the neck off it, spits the neck on the ground, chugs the entire bottle, then *eats the bottle*, grinding the glass with his teeth and swallowing like it's nothing more than an apple.

The bartender, by now cowering up against the back counter of the bar, says in squeak of a voice, ""Can I get you anything else, mister?""

And the guy says...

...

He climbs the hill but as he nears he is beaten and kicked back down the hill by the guards. As he picks himself back up again he hears, ""Peter. . . Peter,"" but now in even fainter tones. With determination in his heart Peter limps back up the hill and manages to sneak past the guard as the Centurion is beating another spectator.

Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel!

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.",14

The old man thinks for a second. He reaches into his pants, pulls out his wallet, and removes a carefully folded piece of paper. He unfolds it and shows it to the genie.

""This is my home country of Israel,"" he says. ""They have never known peace, there is constant strife and turmoil, and my people have been persecuted throughout history. Can you bring peace to my country and people?""

The genie bows. ""Master, I am sorry, but there are limits even to my power. I cannot do this task.""

A  son moved away to go to college, taking leave of his family and the  family dog, Blue. A few months later, his father got a call from his  son.  


""Dad,"" he said, ""there's an amazing program here that teaches dogs to talk!""  
   
That's amazing!' his dad said. 'How do I get Blue into that program?'  


'Just send him down here with $2,000,' the son said. 'I'll get him into the course.'  


So his father sent the dog and $2,000.  


About two-thirds through the semester, the boy called home again.  


'So, how's Blue doing, son?' his father enquired.  


'Awesome!  Dad, he's talking up a storm... But you just won't believe this.  They've had such good results with talking, they've begun to teach the  dogs how to read.'  


'Read?' exclaimed his father. 'No kidding! How do we get Blue into that program?'  


'Just send $4,500. I'll get him into the class.'  
The money promptly arrived.   
   
But  our hero noticed an impending problem. At the end of the year, his  father would find out that the dog can neither talk nor read.  


Then,  finally, he came up with a plan. First he gave the dog to a nice  family. Then he went home at the end of the year to see his excited  father.  
   
'Where's Blue? I just can't wait to talk with him, and see him read something!'  


'Dad,'  the boy said. 'I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we  left to drive home, Blue kicked back in the recliner to read the Wall  Street Journal. Then he suddenly turned to me and asked, 'So, is your  dad still seeing that little redhead barmaid at the pub?''  
The father groaned and whispered, 'I hope you shot that bastard before he talked to your mother!'  


'I sure did, dad!'

The first thing he noticed, besides the nice red sports car, was how hot the driver was! Drop dead blonde, the works.

""I've pulled you over for speeding, Ma'me.... could I see your drivers license...?""

""...What's a license...???"" replied the blonde, instantly giving away the fact that she was as dumb as a stump.

""It's usually in your wallet..."" replied the officer. After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it. ""Now may I see your registration..."" asked the cop.

""Registration..... what's that....?"" asked the blonde. ""It's usually in your glove compartment..."" said the cop impatiently. After some more fumbling, she found the registration. ""I'll be back in a minute..."" said the cop and walked back to his car.

The officer phoned into the dispatch to run a check on the woman's license and registration. After a few moments, the dispatcher came back;

""Ummm.... is this woman driving a red sports car?"" ""Yes...."" replied the officer ""Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?"" asked the dispatcher ""Uh... yes"" replied the cop.

""Here's what you do...."" said the dispatcher. ""Give her the stuff back, and drop your pants...""

""WHAT!!? I can't do that. Its..... inappropriate..."" exclaimed the cop.

""Trust me..... just do it...."" said the dispatcher.

So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said. The blonde looks down and sighs..... ""Ohh no... not ANOTHER breathalyzer......""

The first evening, the ship's Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner:

'Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter's Debutante Ball. I would like you to send three well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance. They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: No Jews please.'

Sending a written message, the captain replied:

'Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending three of my best and most prized officers.

One is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.

The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern university in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD. In Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.

Finally, the third officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .'

Upon receiving this letter, the mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by three handsome naval officers (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).

At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, three very handsome, smiling black officers.

Her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, 'There must be some mistake.'

'No, Madam,' said the first officer, 'Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes.'","""No Jews Allowed""",27249

The man saw John holding an extra drink and said,""Ah, you must want to hear the story of my big orange head."" John replies, ""Yes, I was told if I buy you a drink, you will tell me your story."" 
The man starts to speak, introducing himself as Ron. Ron tells his story: ""One day I was walking along the beach, and I was looking out into the sunset, it was a beautiful day. All of a sudden, a sharp pain ran through my toe, as I had stubbed it on an object in my path. I looked down, and saw a brass lamp with some writing on it. I picked up the lamp and rubbed the writing to get a better look, but then a genie flew out thunderously, and said 'You have freed me from 10,000 years of slavery, and for this, I shall grant you three wishes'. At this point I was stunned, but I knew what my first wish was going to be. I said that I wish to be the wealthiest person on the planet, so the genie snapped his fingers and money started to flow from my pockets. I checked my bank account balance on my phone and the number of zeros extended beyond my phone's screen. I had a deed in my hand owning a 50 bedroom mansion filled with staff waiting for my return. ""
""That's incredible!"" exclaims John, ""so what was your second wish?"" Ron continues, ""my second wish was that I would marry the most beautiful woman in the world. The genie snapped his fingers again, and from the sea emerged the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I fell in love with her the moment I saw her, and the genie married us right then and there on the beach. It was one of the most incredible moments of my life.""
""Wow, I wish I could have stumbled upon this lamp,"" says John, ""but none of this describes why you have a big orange head?"" Ron says, ""continuing on, I had one wish left. I wanted this wish to be unique, so I sat on the beach and thought about it for what felt like a lifetime. After this time, I had come to realize what I wanted for my third wish...""

""... And ever since that moment I have lived my life getting free drinks from people who want to know about my big orange head""

",John walks into a bar and sees a strange man in the corner.,4

At this point, after the Weinstein revelations, he was convinced that the show business industry was completely corrupt and directors and producers only cast people who were willing to do “favours” for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

He’d turned down a director in the recent past who had said “we can come to an arrangement, if you catch my drift”. But James had always said to himself that he could get the good roles on merit alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling hopeless, as a last resort before he did anything rash, he decided it would be a good idea to text his elderly ex-drama teacher, Dr Winston, for some advice. He knew that if there was anyone he could trust, it was him. Dr Winston had never been wrong in all the time he’d known him. 

&amp;#x200B;

*James: Hi Dr Winston, I’ve been working so hard to get roles and absolutely nothing’s working for me. I am at the point where I feel like I might do something I regret, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes. Do you have any advice for me?* 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes, he got a reply.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dr Winston: Hi Jam es*

*Dr Winston: Nice to h ear from yo u*

*Dr Winston: All you ne ed to know is*

*Dr Winston: The pen is*

&amp;#x200B;

Then nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

James put his phone down. His worst fears had been confirmed. He wasn’t gay, but if he was going to get anywhere he knew what he was going to have to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

He decided that he didn’t want to waste anymore time and immediately called up the director who’d made a pass at him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He went over that afternoon and did the deed with the slimy old director. It was horrible. He knew he was going to be scarred for life after this, but at least he had a role.

&amp;#x200B;

He got home and sat with his head in his hands, disgusted with himself. His phone buzzed again. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Dr Winston: Sorry James. I had to write that in a rush before I went to lunch with my wife.*

*Dr Winston: As I was saying*

*Dr Winston: All you need to know is*

*Dr Winston: The pen is mightier than the sword. You’re a beautiful writer. Write them a letter/script and they will see what a wonderfully talented individual you are. They’ll snap you up in no time. You know you can trust me on this.*","A young frustrated actor, James, was desperately looking for a role.",5

Then, he proceeded up her thigh, stopping just at the uppermost portion of her leg. He continued in the same manner on her right side, then suddenly stopped, rolled over and became silent.

post,ba70vu,2qh72,jokes,false,1554573467,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ba70vu/a_gambling_problem/,self.jokes,,"So there's an 80 year old man who one day gets a call from the IRS. 

IRS: hello sir we've noticed large amounts of money moving into and out of your account and I need you to come down for a meeting tomorrow and explain some things or we may have to perform an audit. 

The old man agrees and after a good long minute he decides he's going to get himself a lawyer. 

The next day the old man and his lawyer show up to their meeting and sit down with the IRS agent, the meeting goes as follows. 

IRS: so we've noticed large sums of money moving into and out of your bank account and we may have to perform an audit if you don't tell us where all this money is coming from.  

Old man: well you see I have a bit of a gambling problem. 

IRS agent: you mean to tell me, that all this money is from gambling? What do you even gamble on??

Old man: horses, fights, actually I'll gamble on anything really. 

IRS agent: you'll gamble on anything? Give me an example. 

The old man thinks for a minute and comes up with a brilliant idea. He says ""I bet you $5000 that I won't be able to bite my left eye!"". The IRS agent thought long and hard before deciding there's no possible way he could bite his eye and agrees. With that the old man takes his glass eye out and bites it. 
""Aww shit"" the IRS agents jaw dropped in disbelief and before he was able to pick it back up the old man spoke up, ""now I don't want you to be upset with me mr IRS agent so I'll make you a deal, I'll give you a chance to earn back your money and even more if you take my next bet. I bet you $10000 that I can bite my right eye too!""

The IRS agent thought even longer and even harder about this but he knew the old man wasn't blind because he was walking perfectly unaided. So he excepted, and with that the old man took out his false teeth and bit his right eye. ""oh fuck ya, you old con bastard""
""Now now"" the old man exclaimed, ""I'll give you one more chance to earn all of your money back plus even more! I bet you $20000 that if your trashcan is on the other end of the room, and I'm standing on your desk, that I can't piss in that trashcan without spilling a single drop."" The IRS agent replied faster than light knowing that what the man had offered was impossible, ""you're on!"" He shouted excitedly before moving his trashcan to the other side of the room. 

With that, the old man whipped out his dick and sprayed piss all over the room and all over the IRS agents desk. The agent cheered for joy and laughed and hoorayed as he had just won $20000. He then looked over to the lawyer who had his head in his hands. ""what's wrong with you?"" He asked.

""He bet me $100000 that he could get you to enjoy him pissing on your desk""",A gambling problem.,94

The game kicks off and after 20 minutes, the elephant scores a nice trunked finish from the edge of the box; the spider couldn’t get any of its eight legs near it. 

Just before half time, the leopard roared its team to a 2-0 lead with a deft finish from the penalty spot.

At half time the small animals manager had to make a change, he decided to sub on the centipede for the ant.

As soon as the second half began, the centipede dribbled the ball around 5 large animals and scored an incredible goal to make it 1-2. A few minutes later the centipede repeated this feat to equalise. 

The match eventually finished 6-2 to the small animals, with the centipede scoring all six goals. At full time, the lion walked up to the centipede wanting to swap shirts and said “blimey centipede, you’re an incredible football player! Why on Earth were you not on the pitch for the first half?”

The centipede replied “I was busy putting my boots on!”",A football match,2
