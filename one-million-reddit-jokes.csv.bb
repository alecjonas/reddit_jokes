He said yes it’s a fantastic job, the money isn’t as good as being a dentist but you get to keep the tips. 

Also you get to use all the latest cutting edge technology. 

Some people think that actually I am really expensive but the last thing I want to do is be a rip off. 

I do offer discounts but then again Most of my customers are Jewish and  it’s true they just can’t resist anything that’s 10% off. 

I indulged him a little bit and said that’s fascinating do you ever circumcise famous people? 

Yes he said the other day I circumcised Stephen Spielberg. He came in and asked for the directors cut. That’s actually ended up getting fired from my practise? 

You got fired i said? What happened? 

Well I got the sack he replied. It’s fine though I’ve joined a new practice where we only circumcise elephants and rhinos. Is there much money in that I asked? No he said but the tips are massive. Anyway I intend to make some extra income by releasing my book this year.

The father asked, “Why did you say good-bye grandpa?” 

 

The little girl said, “I don’t know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.” 

 

The next day grandpa died.  The father thought it was a strange coincidence.  A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this: “God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.” 

 

The next day the grandmother died.  Oh my gosh, thought the father, this kid is in contact with the other side.  Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed, the dad heard her say: “God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.” 

 

He practically went into shock.  He couldn’t sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.  He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch sent in and watched the clock.  He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.  He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound.  Finally, midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home. 

 

When he got home his wife said, “I’ve never seen you work so late, what’s the matter?” 

 

He said, “I don’t want to talk about it.  I’ve just spent the worst day of my life.”

The guy in the Mini smiles back at the guy in the Roller and raises an eyebrow as he in turn presses another button and his seat reclines slightly, all while he's starting the guy in the Rolls Royce in the face. Mr Rolls Royce takes up the competition as he smugly presses a button on his dash and his seat reclines and his arm rest contours up slightly. Mr Rolls Royce winks as he does this knowing he's scored a point here. 

As the lights go amber the guy in the Mini reaches forward and presses yet another button on his centre console and his rear seat smoothly flattens out into a bed. Lights go green and he's away leaving the guy in the Rolls Royce with his jaw dropped open.  Mr Rolls Royce is fucking livid. Being done over by that little pip squeak, he decides to drive straight to his local Rolls Royce garage. He gets there and demands that they drop everything and he tells them that at the press of a button he wants the rear seat of his car to open fluidly into a double bed. The mechanic tells him it can be done but it'll be incredibly expensive and he'll be without his car for a couple of weeks. 

Two weeks later he picks up his car and then spends the next two months driving round looking for that little fucker in the Mini. There's no way he's letting him think he's got one over on him.  For two months straight he's driving around town looking for this Mini and its driver. He looks everywhere, can't find him, and he's getting despondent until one day he sees this Mini parked up down a little lovers lane. Gleefully he pulls up next to this Mini which is gently rocking back and forth with its windows all misted up. He pulls up level with it and rolls his window down and knocks on the window of the Mini. The owner of the Mini clears the mist from his window with his hand and looks quizzically at the smug face of the Rolls Royce driver and asks what he wants. Mr Rolls Royce who has been waiting for this moment for two months now simply presses a button on his centre console and delivers what he believes to be the killer blow as his rear seats smoothly switch and expand into this beautiful double bed complete with satin sheets. Two roses on the pillow complete with two flutes of champagne pop up ready to use.  With a massive grin the guy in the Rolls Royce simply says to the guy in the Mini

One day, John meets a woman and they start dating. But the woman is tired of all the tractor related items in Johns home. 

Girl: John I really like you but you have to get rid of all that tractor stuff or else it’s over. So it’s either me or the tractors. Choose one.

John: Ok, I choose you then. If this is what it takes to stay with you then alright. I’ll get rid of that stuff right now.

So John does just that. He has regular posters and paintings up, he got rid of all the toys and he got normal bedsheets too.

He then goes to the pub with his friends for some drinks.

Friends 1: John I’m so glad you got rid of all that tractor stuff.

Friend 2: Yeah, whenever we met up you would only talk about tractors and I started worrying that you wouldn’t be able to stop.

Suddenly, the pub catches fire and everyone runs outside and does a headcount. They realise that someone is missing.

They hear a scream from inside. 
Before his friends could stop him, John runs in looking for the person.

He hears the screams coming from the bathroom but the door to the bathroom is covered by smoke and flames.

John sucks up all the smoke, kicks open the door and carries the person out over his shoulder.

When John gets the person to safety all Johns friends were really confused.

Friend 3: John how did you do that!?

He's got pretty decent moves and this guy is absolutely shredding on his equally tiny piano that came with him. I was taken aback because I hadn't seen this sort of stuff before. So I wait until all the patrons in the bar got bored with the little 11 inch pianist, and I ask the guy where in the heck he found an 11 inch pianist. He tells me that he got it from his genie in a bottle. I call BS on him because theres no way that's possible. Sure enough, he pulls it out and it's pretty old, but it could still be a prop or whatever. I'm a natural skeptic you see. Anyways, he tells me to rub it and make a wish. Skeptically, I rub it, and a huge plume of smoke appears and it envelops the room to where I cant see anything. A genie appears and asks what my wish is. I say, alright, if this is real, I want a million bucks. He snaps his fingers and theres a blinding flash of light and I lose my vision for a few seconds before it turns back to normal. When the chaos clears, I hear a ""quack quack quack"", and to my horror I see a million ducks all throughout the bar and out the doors. I'm angry, and I say to the man wielding the 11 inch pianist, ""hey man that genie ripped me off"", and proceed to say ""he must be deaf or something , I asked for a million bucks not ducks"".

The policeman thinks nothing of and moves to the pigs. The Brunette thinks quickly and tries to mimic the pigs and yells “Oink” “Oink”.

post,epk7ns,2qh72,jokes,false,1579185800,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/epk7ns/new_hr_policy/,self.jokes,,"Dear Employee:

As a result of the reduced budget, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.  


Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.

This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be allowed to look for jobs outside the company.

SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase is called SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All workers who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management. This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).  


Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but maybe SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.  


If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).  


As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received these will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.  


The management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our SHIT (Special High-Intensity Training). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area.

  
If any employee feels that they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor. Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure that you receive all the SHIT that you can stand.

And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.",New HR policy,34

post,eph7m5,2qh72,jokes,false,1579167804,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eph7m5/very_long/,self.jokes,," First off, let me describe to you a little creature.

 There lives in the forest a little guy known as a 'Twid'. A Twid resembles nothing so much as a Smurf on psychedelics. They have punked out hair, multi-colored skin, tattoos and piercings. Also, the sole reason for a Twid's existence on this world is for one purpose.

 Twid's exist to have fun.

 So, on to our story.

 One fine day a solitary Twid was ambling through the forest, looking for something fun to do. He was particularly bored this day (near-death for a Twid) and he felt that a morning walk through the forest would provide some form of entertainment he couldn't find back in Twid village.

 He's making his way along when he spots a rabbit sitting in a glade, minding it's own business, as rabbits are wont to do. The thought strikes this Twid that it might be fun to chase the rabbit, so he goes running towards it. Sure enough, the rabbit dashes off in the other direction and the race is on!

 Over hills, through the brush, and around trees the pair runs. The Twid is giggling madly as he runs after the rabbit, all thought of boredom forgotten. It's when they rabbit turns and heads up a large and steep hill that this story takes a strange turn.

 You see, there's an old ogre who has chosen the top of this particular hill to lie down on for a midday nap in the sunshine. When the rabbit reaches the top of the hill and runs over him, the ogre awakens with a start, not sure of what just happened. He looks down the hill and sees this obviously deranged Twid giggling and running towards him at full speed.

 So, he stands up, and when the Twid reaches the top of the hill, the ogre kicks him!

 Down the hill the Twid rolls, coming to rest at the bottom. He jumps back up to his feet and dashes up the hill again. Rolling down the hill had been the most fun ever! He gets back to the top and, surely as it did the first time, the ogre kicks the Twid down again.

 The Twid does this over and over, running back up the hill to have the ogre kick him back down. After a few dozen times, the idea strikes the Twid that this would be so much more fun with his friends!

 So he dashes back to Twid village and rounds up all the other Twids, telling them about the ogre and the hill deep in the forest. All the Twids head out to see about this new fun the first Twid had found.

 Before long, a game had started. The Twids would line up on side of the hill, and the ogre would kick them down the other side.

 Well, the rabbit that our original Twid had been chasing was wondering what was going on. He had been enjoying being chased by the Twid, and went back looking for him. Seeing the line of Twids going up the hill and being kicked down by the ogre, he decided to give it a try.

 So he gets in line, and when he reaches the top of the hill, the ogre just shrugs at him.

 ""What's wrong,"" asked the rabbit, ""aren't you going to kick me too?""

 The ogre replies, ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Twids.""",Very long.,4

He got a big shard of glass in his eye making him blind in one eye, he had to walk around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for months. Then suddenly he disappeared along with my girlfriend, apparently they bonded during the time after his injuries. They eloped, left me behind without even a note.

For the third time, the man backed off. For the third time, he put his pants back on. For the third time, the dog jumped off the cow's back and walked away.

The man was about to lower his pants a fourth time, when a huge, hairy monster jumped out from behind a bush. The beast looked like a cross between a lion and a gorilla that was the size of an elephant. He chased the man and his companions through the jungle.

Finally, the monster had the man, the dog, and the cow cornered. The man closed his eyes and waited for the beast to kill him. Suddenly, he felt something grab him, and the next instant he was flying through the air. 

When the man opened his eyes, he was sitting safely in a tree with a woman who was holding a vine. He figured that the woman must have rescued him. The woman swung back down on the vine and rescued the dog and even the cow, and carried them into the tree. Then she jumped down from the tree and effortlessly killed the enormous monster.

After the woman lowered the other three from the tree, the man took a good look at her. She was completely naked, and very beautiful. She also had some pretty impressive muscles, which somehow made her even more beautiful. The man was so stunned, all he could say was, ""You...you saved our lives.""

""Were you on a cruise?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" said the man. ""So was I,"" said the woman. ""When I was five years old, I was on a cruise with my family. Then the ship sank, and I was the only one to survive. I swam to this island, and it wasn't long before I had my first narrow escape from one of those huge monsters. I had to make myself strong in order to survive here.""

""You are the first human I have seen in fifteen years, and I would be willing to do anything for you.""

The man looked at the beautiful, naked woman with a sly grin on his face. ""Anything?"" he asked. ""Oh, yes!"" said the woman.

""In that case,"" said the man, ""would you take my dog here for a walk?""","A man, a dog, and a cow were on a cruise when their ship sank.",165

I started the exercise just as he suggested. I was able to pull with one arm easily and finished 12 reps in no time. The trainer looked surprised.

Then i switched the arm. And suddenly the weights feel too heavy. I could hardly pull the weights. With much effort I was able to finish 4 reps. Couldn't finish the 5th one.

I started wondering why it was that I am able to pull the weights easily with one hand but was struggling so badly with the other. That's when it hit me

One day he sees a woman, with no arms and no legs just lying in the sand and crying. 


So he walks up to her and asks what's wrong and she says 


"" well all my life, nobody has ever given me a hug."" 


So he's just like ""fuck it, i'll give you a hug!"" 


He gives her a hug, she's ecstatic, and he goes on his way.


The next morning the same man, running on the same beach, sees the same woman and she's crying again.


""What's the matter today, honey?""


""Well you see, all through my life i've never been kissed""


So he gives her a kiss, she's happy again, and he goes on his way.

On the third day, the man sees her again and once again she's crying. Getting sick of this he walks up to her and says


""What's the matter today?""


She looks up at him sheepishly 


""Well, all through my life... i've never been fucked.""


He thinks to himself for a moment...


""Okay"" he says and her eyes light up.


He picks the woman up and starts walking to the edge of the water and then hurls her into the ocean.

After a couple of weeks the wife asked, “Honey, have you ever noticed that she only goes up to people with boom boxes and other electronic devices?”

He hadn’t and said so. Then she said, “Tomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what she’s really doing.”

Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. “Well, is she selling drugs?” she asked excitedly.”

“No, she’s not.” he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.

Robert your father’s brother

So I was talking to my husband who’s from England as a I heard a very confusing phrase talking to another English person at work earlier on today.

Wife: “Honey, what does Robert your father’s brother mean?”

My husband grins.

Husband: “it’s another English slang for the term ‘bob’s your uncle’ and come to think of it, it’s quite complicated to describe. But, I’ll use it in a sentence.” 

He ponders for a short while.

Husband: “So you know how I was struggling to fit everything in the cupboard?” 

Wife: “Yes?”

Husband: “Well I bought that cupboard organiser from target and put all the small stuff so everything could fit and then bobs your uncle.”

Slightly confused I smiled and said “Ok! I guess that sort of makes sense!”

Later on that evening me and my husband were getting frisky. We began to have some real hot steamy sex. He was pounding me very hard in all the right places

Husband: “you like that?” He says while breathing heavily.

“Yeah” I respond “go faster, fuck me faster”

The tempo picks up, and my husband is pounding me really hard. I feel like I’m close to climax and I anticipate my husband is too. 

Husband: “how’d you want me to fuck you?” he says as he goes in a hard motion.

I was in such a deep sexual state I didn’t respond.

He slaps my arse and repeats “come on, how’d you want me to tuck you”

I let out a loud orgasmic groan as I say “like Robert, your father’s brother”",Robert your father’s brother,0

Wife: “Honey, what does Robert your father’s brother mean?”

My husband grins.

Husband: “it’s another English slang for the term ‘bob’s your uncle’ and come to think of it, it’s quite complicated to describe. But, I’ll use it in a sentence.” 

He ponders for a short while.

Husband: “So you know how I was struggling to fit everything in the cupboard?” 

Wife: “Yes?”

Husband: “Well I bought that cupboard organiser from target and put all the small stuff so everything could fit and then bobs your uncle.”

Slightly confused I smiled and said “Ok! I guess that sort of makes sense!”

Later on that evening me and my husband were getting frisky. We began to have some real hot steamy sex. He was pounding me very hard in all the right places

Husband: “you like that?” He says while breathing heavily.

“Yeah” I respond “go faster, fuck me faster”

The tempo picks up, and my husband is pounding me really hard. I feel like I’m close to climax and I anticipate my husband is too. 

Husband: “how’d you want me to fuck you?” he says as he goes in a hard motion.

I was in such a deep sexual state I didn’t respond.

He slaps my arse and repeats “come on, how’d you want me to tuck you”

I let out a loud orgasmic groan as I say “like Robert, your father’s brother”",Robert your father’s brother,2

As he sits there, mulling over his day, he hears a high-pitched voice say, ""That shirt looks great on you!”

The man looks around, doesn’t see anything, and returns to his drink thinking nothing more of it. But then, a moment later, the voice returns, this time offering, “You seem like a really cool guy!”

Again, the man looks around, sees nothing, and returns to his drink, wondering if he should get checked out by a professional. Finally, when his nerves have cooled and he believes the voice is gone, he hears, “I bet your parents are really proud of you!”

He slams down his drink and looks around wildly. Frustrated and finding no possible source of the voice, he calls over the bartender. He says, “Hey barkeep! What’s that voice I keep hearing?”

“Oh, those are the peanuts,” the bartender replies. “They’re complimentary.”",A guy walks into a bar after a long day at work and orders a drink.,18

True, the grass is always greener on the other side, and one might cross the road in hopes that those pastures truly will be more full of bird seed and such.  But in doing so, one risks not only the near certain death associated with being run over by a truck but also something much worse: Disappointment.  

But should we instead stay where we are, never striving for more?  Should we sit in our cozy hen houses, admiring the fat hens as they stride back and forth?  Is not this its own form of death, ladled out in tiny little helpings of feed?  Does not the the banality of happiness itself risk finally disappointing, as in the end nothing is achieved but the passage of too much of our too little time.

Are those roosters who cross the street therefore adventurers seeking more or just lost souls desperately running from the nothingness that fills them?  What leads a rooster to be motivated to cross a road?  What inner drive compels action in a world gone stale?

""Wow,"" the guy replies. ""You actually understood and answered me!""

""I happen to be a highly intelligent thoroughly educated bird."" says the parrot.

""OK! Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?"" the guy asks.

""Well,"" the parrot says, ""this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my penis around the perch like a hook.  You can't see it because of my feathers.""

""You really can understand me can't you?"" says the guy.

""Actually, I speak Spanish and English, I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy, you name it.    
You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion.""

""Sorry, but I just can't afford $2500 for a bird, no matter how interesting he is.""

""I'm defective, so the truth is, nobody wants me cause I don't have any feet. You can probably get for less, just make an offer!""

The guy offers $20 and walks out with the parrot.

Weeks go by. The parrot is sensational. He has a great sense of humor, he's interesting and is a great companion.  The guy is delighted.

One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot goes, ""Psssssssssssst,"" and motions him over with one wing. ""I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but it's about your wife and the postman.""

""What are you talking about?"" asks the guy.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

Cinderella wept so violently that she could barely speak. And, even more so, to listen. Fairy decided to wait. Let the goddaughter calm down a bit. 

A few minutes later, Cinderella blew her nose in the apron and said almost calmly:

""He ... He was so sweet. So kind. He understood me without words. And so handsome! I was so happy. But it all ended when the clock struck midnight. And now I don’t have the reason to live.""

""How is it - no reason? - Fairy was amazed. - Dummy, didn’t you understand? Nothing ended, everything is barely begun. The prince is crazy about you and doesn’t want to hear about the other brides. He picked up your shoe on the stairs, I hope his dad is bright enough to put a well-trained search dog on the trail. Well, anyway, the prince seriously intends to look for you. He will find you, wait and see. And you're golden. 

“What does the prince have to do with it?” - asked in a trembling voice Cinderella. Tears flowed down her cheeks again, but there was no strength left for violent sobs.

""How - with what? - taken aback Fairy. - You said yourself - the prince is handsome, kind, dear, understands everything...""

""No, - Cinderella waved off. - The prince is a great dancer, but this is perhaps his only virtue. I'm talking about the coachman.""

""But how will we afford the monthly payments, honey?"" bemoaned the driver.

""We could save a lot of money if you would quit drinking wine and spirits, babe,"" replied the passenger.

""Oh yeah, well we would save even more if you would stop leaving all the lights on in the house, day and night, dear,"" the driver retorted. The passenger sighed.

""The car really is lovely. Tell you what,"" offered the passenger. ""I'm willing to unscrew every lightbulb in the house until the car is paid for, if you're willing to forego alcohol for the duration. At that rate we'll have more than enough. What do you say?""

The driver considered this for a moment, and smiled. ""It's a deal, my love,"" and the two lovers shook hands. Suddenly, there arose a deafening ""BANG!"" as all the car's airbags deployed at once. After making sure they were both alright, they called the dealership, who sent out a tow truck with a mechanic.

As the couple shook off their shock and alarm and the tow driver hitched up the car, the mechanic connected a wireless adapter to the diagnostic port under the dashboard, and began taking readings on a smart phone.

As he checks out the menu trying to decide what he wants, he sees a waiter bring a dish to another customer.

The other customer starts eating what appear to be two large meatballs with great gusto. When the waiter comes to his table, the man asks about the dish. ""Oh Senor, that is the Matador Special,"" replies the waiter in broken English, ""Our very best dish! Fresh vegetables, beans and zee cojones from zee bull. We get the cojones immediately after the bull fight. Exquisito!""

""Okay, that's what I'll have,"" says the businessman.

""But I am very sorry Senor, but that dish is only available once per day.""

Disappointed, the man chooses another dish and plans to order the Matador Special the next day.

The next day the man goes to the bull fight again, and afterwards stops into the restaurant. Just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees another waiter bringing the Matador Special to a customer who got there before him. ""Damn!"" he says to himself. ""And tomorrow's my last day here.""

So the next day, he skips the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early. He is the first one seated, and proudly proclaims, ""I'll have the Matador Special!""

""An excellent choice, Senor!"" responds the waiter. Soon afterwards, the waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly small, and taste rather foul.

post,eogoai,2qh72,jokes,false,1578978323,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eogoai/hairstyle_competition/,self.jokes,,"Hello, my name is John and I would like to tell you about the time I entered a hairstyle competition. You see, I have always loved trying out different hairstyles and colors. It is something I have put great effort into!

It was about February of last year that the idea of entering a hairstyle competition crossed my mind when I was walking around in town and saw a flyer on a board. It said something along the lines of ""Calling all hair extraordinaires! $1000 prize for the best hairstyle!"" I saw that it was almost exactly a year away. Plenty of time to grow my hair into an extraordinary style! The flyer had a chunk of writing missing out of the bottom but overall looked legit, so I considered giving it a shot. 

Throughout the following weeks I became more and more invested in this competition. I started sketching ideas. One was an all light blue color, sprayed straight up to the sky. The next was a green, red and yellow combo in liberty spikes. They were pretty good, but none seemed quite right.

On day I was sitting on the couch flipping through channels when Dr Phil came on and I got an idea. *Wouldn't it be hilarious -* I thought, *if I had that but the part with hair was super long!* While this would certainly not be a cool hairstyle, I realized that I had to do something profound and unique if I wanted to stand a chance in this competition! If I showed up with something which I deem ""boringly unique"" like a mohawk or a mullet I sure to lose! That was it, I was determined to somehow end up with this legendary hairstyle I had in mind, it would be my win, my moment! I was going to do it!

Now I knew it would be difficult to recreate Dr Phil's legendary male pattern baldness doo on top as I have been blessed with thick hair! I was going to have to shave it constantly, but it was worth the effort, worth the effort for sweet, sweet victory! I got a quality razor, the ""Merkur Futur Adjustable Safety Razor"" to be exact! I carefully parted my hair buzzed down and trimmed the top with my beard trimmer and then lathered up shaving cream and shaved my mop of hair. I'll be honest, not the greatest look but the sides were not particularly long at this point so at least it just looked like your standard skullet. It was alright really, I could wear baseball caps and look as normal as everyone else. No worries! Now it was all about growing those sides out, I realized that the possibility of having extensions might be needed but I was going to get them as long as possible first.

It was at about the halfway point to the competition now and it wasn't until then that I realized I probably could have just grown it all out and then shaved the top close to the competition but whatever! I was saving 25% of hairs worth of Shampoo and Conditioner! So, I shaved and grew and shaved and grew for another couple of months and the competition was vastly approaching. I decided extensions were the way to go and so I looked online and found a great set! I tested them out and they went down to my knees, perfect! 

After all this waiting it was finally the night before the competition! I was feeling the nerves, it would suck to put all that effort in not to win! I went to the store to get my styling supplies, spray, straighteners, curlers. You name it, I had it in that shopping cart. I reassured myself my hair had to be the best and went to sleep.

The day of was here! I got up at 5 o'clock ready to style my hair for the contest. First, I freshly shaved the top. Second, I dried and straightened the sides and back. I placed the extensions in carefully and began straightening. I then curled some parts and platted others. In the end my hair was looking like the perfect mess I had been looking for. Bald as an egg on the top and flowing and luscious on the sides and back. I was ready!

I got in the car carefully making sure not to mess anything up, I glanced over at the flyer for the address and I was on my way. I showed up to the venue super early, I thought it would be fun to get to know everybody and just chill! I could feel my heart beating out of my chest, I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car. The event person greeted me with a smile and said ""welcome!""

""thanks!"" I responded

He then glanced down briefly and said, ""You've really dressed up for the occasion haven't you!""

""Indeed!"" I said, ""I mean, I had to!""

""Ah!"" he said ""Best of luck my friend...so...where is the little fella?""

""I'm sorry?"" I retorted

""Where's your dog?"" ""If they have hair anything as extraordinary as yours, they're sure to win!""",Hairstyle Competition,6

The doctor curiously looks into the situation. 
    “Turns out your penis is too large and it’s pulling on your vocal chords sir, we can remove 9” of it and it should clear your problems speaking”, says the doctor. Flabbergasted, the man storms out of the doctors office in a huff. “Thh..th..the hell wih..wihh..with thaa Doctor.. i.. i.. need mm.mmmore th..than fuh.. four inches“ 
      
      Years go by, and opportunity after opportunity seem to pass by because of his problem speaking, the man decides to undergo the surgery and contacts the doctor. The procedure was a success and the doctor was able to fix his vocal problems. 

  Two months after his surgery, he’s landed a career, a beautiful girlfriend, and things seem to be looking up for him. All the things he thought to be missing out on in life are happening around him.. BUT!! there’s this new regret building fast in the pit of his mind.
 “I miss my big cock terribly, my girlfriend craves passion, my confidence is starting to fade. I need to change things and get my cock back” he remorsefully said to him self as he heads to the doctors. 

   He storms into the doctors office demanding his penis be re-lengthened. “Doctor change my penis back at once. I don’t care about the speech impediment I want my lonely life back with my big cock!!”. The doctor slowly stilts his eyes from the newspaper he is reading to the mans face. He casually sits back in his chair kicking his feet up and with a smirk on his face the doctor blurts out

 “guh..guhh..get th..thh..the fuh..fuck out uh..uhh..of muh..muhh..my uhh..uh..uhh..office!!!”",Too much cock..,9

post,eof6l2,2qh72,jokes,false,1578970815,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eof6l2/no_sex_tonight/,self.jokes,,"I’ve never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said “I don’t feel like it, I just want you to hold me.”

I said “WHAT??!! What was that?!”

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear…”You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.”

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey.”

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all dear; let’s go to the cashier.”

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel like it.”

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, “WHAT?”

I then said “Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You’re just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”
