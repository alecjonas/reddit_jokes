He took her to see several rooms, and when everything was settled, the lady returned home to make the final preparations to move. When she arrived home, she realized that she had not seen a W.C. That's a water closet to the British. We would call it a bathroom. So she wrote a note to the schoolmaster asking him if there were a W.C. around. The schoolmaster's English was very poor, so he asked the parish priest if he could help in the matter. Together they tried to discover the meaning of the letters W.C. and the only solution they could find for the letters was a 'wayside chapel.' The schoolmaster then wrote to the English lady the following note:

""Dear Madam,

I take great pleasure in informing you that the W.C. is situated nine miles from the house you occupy, in the center of a beautiful grove of pine trees surrounded by lovely grounds. It is capable of holding 229 people and is open on Sunday and Thursday only. As there is a great number of people and they are expected during the summer months, I would suggest that you come early, although there is plenty of standing room as a rule.

  'You will no doubt be glad to hear that a good number of people bring their lunch and make a day of it, while others who can afford to go by car and arrive just in time. I especially recommend that your ladyship go on Thursday when there is musical accompaniment.

  'It may interest you to know that my daughter was married in the W.C. and it was there that she met her husband. I can remember the rush there was for seats There were ten people to a seat usually occupied by one. It was wonderful to see the expressions on their faces.

  'The newest attraction is a bell donated by a wealthy resident of the district. It rings every time a person enters. A bazaar is to be held to provide plush seats for all the people, since they feel it is a long-felt need. My wife is rather delicate, so she can't attend regularly.

  'I shall be delighted to reserve the best seat for you if you wish, where you will be seen by all. For the children, there is a special time and place so that they will not disturb the elders. Hoping to have been some service to you.

Sincerely,
The Schoolmaster""

   ""I'm glad you asked!"" Says the bartender. ""I've been running me an impossible contest, and it's twenty bucks to enter. You puts the money in and I pours ten of my special cocktails. To win the pot, you've gots to overcome three challenges."" The bartender holds up his fingers and counts down, one by one.
   ""First, you've gots to drink all ten cocktails. Drain 'em dry.
   ""Second, there's a kennel out back where Ol' Measles the bulldog lives, and he's got him a rotten tooth that needs a-pullin'
   ""Finally, there's this ol' lady what been lonely for some special company for the past ten years. 
   ""If'n you can drain them tumblers, snatch that there tooth, and make sweet love to the ol' lady you win the pot. Up for it?"" 

   Clearly, the bartender was insane. ""Not for me, thanks. Just give me a stout."" The man takes his drink and sits as far away from the bar as possible.
  As the night wears on, the man can't get that jar of money out of his head. That's a *lot* of money. And the bartender's challenge isn't really all that bad, not for that much money, and old ladies need love too. Besides, he'd be so blackout drunk from the cocktails he wouldn't remember a thing. 
   Having finally convinced himself, the man pulls out his twenty and shuffles up to the bar. 

   ""WE HAS OURSELVES A NEW CHALLENGER!"" The bartender yells as he lines up ten glasses. The entire bar stops what they are doing and circles the man, excited and cheering. 
   By the third drink, the man is already sloshed. By the fifth, he can hardly stand. At the seventh, he has to take a break and make more room. But finally, somehow, slurring and stumbling the bartender shows him the way to the kennel and explains which tooth he'll have to pull. 
   ""Glott idt,"" he garbles, and the bartender shuts the door behind him.

   Someone unplugs the juke box and the patrons crowd around the back door, listening. There are sounds of clinking and clanking. Shuffling. A latch. Everything is quiet.

   And then it begins. Growling turns to barking, barking evolves into the sounds of a most vicious struggle, man against beast. 
   Ripping and scratching and biting and colliding. Something breaks with a loud BANG. Every so often the patrons hear the man scream like there's bloody murder. Finally, there's a pained yelping from the dog and a deep, choked silence. 

   The patrons lean together towards the door, straining to hear. Did the man survive? Did the dog? 
   An insistent knock scares the literal pee out of a  poor lady with her ear to the door at that moment, but nobody notices because when the door opens it does so to a scene from a horror film.

   The man is drenched in blood. His clothing is shredded and caked in mud. The kennel is broken. Part of the man's ear is missing. Ol' Measles is whimpering in the far corner.

  ""Oh lordy"", whispers the bartender. The man drunkenly limps inside, leaving a trail of mud and blood. 
   The bartender is just beginning to wonder how he's even alive when the man asks, slurry but business-like:

    ""So, where'sh that old lady with a toothache?""

Three man found three bricks and decided to throw them in the air to see who was the strongest, the last brick to hit the ground would prove the man who threw it as the strongest. They throw it, and the first brick flew for 5 seconds before hitting the ground. The second brick flew for 10 seconds before hitting the ground. The third one threw it so high that the brick never came down. That's it. That's the joke. (Or is it)

The second joke: A women wanted to fly to europe but the only flight she could book was one in which they didn't let pets in, and she wanted to bring her parrot with her. The plane also didn't allow you to smoke.(this happened back when you could smoke in some planes). So the women put her parrot in her hand baggage and went on the plane. Mid flight the captain of the plane is just passing through and he has a cigarette on his mouth. He then tells the women (just chatting you know) that the flight is all good and they'll be in Europe in no time. The parrot then makes a sound and the captain goes ""What was this?"" And as the parrots makes some more noise, the captain grabs it and tells the women ""Pets are forbidden in this plane"" and throws the parrot out of the plane. The women then grabs the captain's cigarette and yells ""You're not allowed to smoke either"" and throws the cigarette out of the plane as well. 
5 minutes passes and the women looks through the window, and sitting on the airplane's wing is the parrot, and he has something in his mouth. What is it?

Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. 

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" 

Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.

so there’s a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake. the first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. the second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. the third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

the kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it’s a valuable resource to have. the first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. the second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. the third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

the night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. the knights in the second kingdom aren’t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.

in the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

the next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. in place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. the battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides",alright you guys have posted some pretty bad jokes on here but not one comes close to this doozy,232

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man who droves train in Bulgaria,38

-Yes indeed. Last night I had to wake up to go the bathroom and when I opened the door, the light turned on by itself. God is watching over me. And when I went back to bed, when I closed the door, the light just turned off. God is watching over me.

After the appointment, the Doctor a bit curious called George's wife to check on this story.

-Hi, George visited me today and told me that God was watching on him and that last night when he went to the bathroom, God turned the light on and off for him. Is that the whole story ?

An enterprising Texas Ranger decided to track him down.
After a long and difficult search, he traced the bandit to his home town. 
On a hunch, he checked the town's cantina, and sure enough, there was the robber. 
The only other people in the bar were the bartender and a scrawny, older man at a back table. 
The time was right to make a move.
The ranger drew his revolver, charged into the cantina, and announced: ""You are under arrest. 
I get a reward for you, dead or alive. Tell me where the money is, and I'll let you live. 
If you don't, I'll shoot you right here, and save myself the trouble of having to take you back to Texas alive.""
But the bandit didn't speak English, and the Ranger didn't speak Spanish. 
As it turned out, the scrawny man at the back of the bar happenedd to be a lawyer. 
He knew the robber, and was bilingual, and quickly offered to translate for the two of them. 
The ranger said: ""Tell him that if he doesn't tell me where the loot is, I'll shoot him here and now.""
Upon hearing what the Ranger had said, and seeing the cold look in his eye, the bandit knew that the Ranger meant it - if he did not give up his loot, he was a dead man. 
Terrified, the bandit blurted out in Spanish that the loot was buried in an old barn at the outskirts of town.
""What did he say?"" asked the Ranger.
The lawyer answered: ""He said, 'You don't have the nerve to shoot me, Yankee swine.",(Long)A Mexican bandit made a specialty of crossing the Rio Grande from time to time and robbing banks in Texas....,11

""I can just squeeze this out all silent and deadly,"" he thinks, ""and not have to interrupt the flow of my strategy.""

This does not work. The fart is audible to everyone in the room. Strangely, it sounds a lot like the word ""Honda."" The man is so rattled that he leaves the meeting room. It gets worse from there: every time he farts (and he soon realizes how frequent this is) it sounds like ""Honda."" sometimes it's a deep baritone **HONDA** and sometimes a tiny soprano ^honda but it's always ""Honda,"" and it's always humiliating.

This doesn't just disturb him; it freaks out his bosses, his girlfriend, his landlord, and even the lady who makes his smoothies. He's an embarrassment to all of them. Within months he's been evicted, dumped, and fired. His Jag has been repossessed. He spent all his savings first on doctors and then on faith healers and alternative medical professionals, with no success. No one can cure him. 

One day, in a half-drunken stupor, he realizes he's down to his last $50. He decides to get completely drunk and jump off a bridge. He ends up wandering through Chinatown looking for cheap booze. He lets one rip. He doesn't even try to stop them, these days: *Honda*.

""Hey you,"" says an elderly Asian man exiting a nearby store, ""You have problem!""

He walks faster, but the old man catches up, grabbing his arm.

""You have problem! You have tooth problem. Go to dentist quickly before it becomes worse.""

He shakes off the old man and staggers away, seeking hooch. However, he notices  a low-income dental clinic on the next block. What the hell... he goes in. His mouth has kind of been hurting, now that he thinks about it.

The dentist informs him he has a seriously abscessed tooth. 

""Huh,"" he thinks. 

The procedure isn't pleasant, and afterward he's completely broke. He decides to skip the booze and head straight for the nearest bridge. On the way, however, he passes gas... and it sounds completely normal. He tries again, and again. He's cured.

This man's courage and motivation return. He cleans himself up, borrows a suit, interviews with his former competitors, and so on. Within six months he has a better job, a better car, and--he is convinced--a more beautiful girlfriend. Eventually it dawns on him that he owes his recovery to the old Asian man. He buys the biggest gift basket he can find, hides a bunch of cash inside, and heads for Chinatown.

He finds the store, locates the old man inside, and tries to give him the basket.  The old man refuses, saying,

""It was nothing. Where I come from, everyone knows this.""

""Knows what?"" asks the lawyer.

""Abscess makes the fart go 'Honda.'""",A lawyer joke that isn't really about lawyers [long],2

Putin runs home and bursts through the door yelling, ""Donald, bring two cups, tonight we drink vodka!!!"" He pees in the cups and sure enough, it's the best vodka either had ever tasted. They drink into the wee hours of the morning.

The next night he comes through the door and again hollers, ""Donald, bring two cups, tonight we drink vodka!!!"" This continues all week until Friday night when Putin comes in the door and exclaims, ""Donald, bring me one cup!!!""

Donald is upset and asks, ""Vladimir, all week you say bring two cups and we drink vodka, so why tonight do you only ask for one cup?""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The legend of the three kingdoms,3

Two members of the US Army, Jack and Thomas, (both flutists) band decide to have a little fun, and go AWOL. They go out on the the bars, and get rightfully drunk. They're having the time of their life, doing shots, and dancing. Jack Says to the Thomas,

""we better get back to base before the Major finds out.""

""I suppose your right, says Thomas, but I met this really attractive girl and I think she wants it.""

""Well we can request a minivan Uber, and you can take the third row"" says Jack

Thomas offers the girl a ride back to her house, as it is only a few miles off base.

So they call an Uber back to base, and things between Thomas and the girl start getting hot. About 15 minutes later they arrive at her house. Thomas asks for her number, but suddenly she says ""I cant see anyone, I'm only in high school""

""ARE YOU TELLING ME I JUST FINGERED A MINOR"" says Thomas

""I wont tell""

She gets out of the Uber and the Van pulls away.  

""OK Thomas"" says Jack, ""Look i know your probably freaking out right now, but I don't think shell tell. Just stay calm, B Sharp, and no body will find out.""

Just then Jacks phone rings.

""Who is calling you at this hour"" - Thomas

""I don't know, nobody knows were out""

Jack reaches in his pocket for his phone and a look of fear covers his face - ""O SHIT IT""S MAJOR C""

""Well you better pick it up, it'll be worse if you don't""

Jack picks it up, and immediately a loud, deep voice starts screaming at them. ""Listen here you fucking maggots! You better get your sorry asses back to base, so help me God if your don't, your own mothers won't recognize you when I'm finished. Tomorrow you two will wish you were never born.

and listened to the duck's chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head
sadly and said, “I’m sorry, your duck Cuddles, has passed away.”

The distressed woman wailed, “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am sure. The duck is dead,” replied the Vet.

“How can you be so sure?” she protested.
“I mean you haven’t done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.”

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left
the room.

He returned a few minutes later with a Labrador.

As the duck’s owner looked on in amazement,
the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it
out of the room.

A few minutes later he returned with a cat.
The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, “I’m sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.”

The Vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck’s owner, still in shock, took the bill. “$. 3000!” she cried, “$. 3000 just to tell me my duck is dead!”

The vet shrugged, “I’m sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $100, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it’s now $3000",A woman brought a very limp duck in to a veterinary surgeon...,173

Not a minute passed, but Peter once again heard his name called whisperingly, ""Peter, Peter...!""

He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people.

Trump asks how she knows if they're intelligent.

""I do so by asking them the right questions,"" says the Queen. ""Allow me to demonstrate.""

Trump watches as the Queen phones David Cameron and says, ""Mr. Prime Minister, please answer this question: your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?""

David Cameron responds, ""It's me, ma'am.""

""Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir,"" says the Queen. She hangs up and says, ""Did you get that, Mr. Trump?""

Trump nods: ""Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!""

Trump, upon returning to Washington, decides he'd better put his entourage to the test. Trump summons to-be Vice-President Mike Pence to the White House and says, ""Tell me Mike, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.""

""Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?""

Trump poses the question: ""Well, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Pence hems and haws and finally asks, ""Can I think about it and get back to you?""

Trump agrees, and Pence leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republican senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Pence calls Rex Tillerson at the State Department and explains his problem.

""Now lookee here, son, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Tillerson answers immediately, ""It's me, of course.""

Much relieved, Pence rushes back to the White House, finds Donald Trump, and exclaims, ""I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Rex Tillerson!""

And Trump replies in disgust, ""Of course not, dumbass! It's David Cameron!""

The man buys his wife a magic dildo. He introduces the magic dildo to his wife, ""Its magic! All you have to do is tell it what to do, and it'll do it!!""
   In disbelief the woman decides to test it. ""Magic dildo, give me an orgasm!"" So the magic dildo quickly flies between her legs and begins to please the woman. The magic dildo is VERY effective. 
   Seeing that the magic dildo is a big success, the man leaves on his business trip with little fear of infidelity. 
   The man has been gone several days now and the wife decides to try out the magic dildo once again. The magic dildo works wonders! One orgasm, two orgasm, three orgasms! The little thing is amazing, but as time goes by the woman grows bored of it and she has a busy schedule. 
""OK magic dildo, stop!
...
I'm done now, I've had enough!""
   For some reason her commands aren't working. She tries for several minutes to get it to stop, but she just can't figure it out. 
Realizing that too much time has gone by already and she has too much to do yet, she decides to go about her business as usual despite the magic dildo still going full-speed-ahead.
   The woman is driving down the road as she reaches yet another orgasm; as you might imagine, such a thing while driving causes her to begin to drive erratically (or ""erotically"", pun intended). 
   A police officer sees her erratic driving and pulls her over. The woman hopelessly tries to explain the situation. She has a magic dildo causing her to orgasm countless times and she can't get it to stop!
   As seems to be the common reaction, the police officer is in disbelief and looks the woman in the eye and says ""Hah! You expect me to believe this shit? Magic dildo my ass.........""",A very busy man needs to leave on a long business trip...,8

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out a beautifully ornate old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like any other dildo in this shop!”

The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo Dildo, the door.”

The Voodoo Dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo Dildo, box!”
The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”
He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.
After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the Voodoo Dildo. 

She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.
After four orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.

 On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she hastily cried, ""The Voodoo Dildo! stuck in my pussy, can't get it out!! Ahhhhh! Need..To..Get..It..OUT!! H-h-help M-m-me!!!""

The officer looked at her incredulously for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!”",Voodoo Dildo,1
