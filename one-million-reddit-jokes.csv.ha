ow a grown man to suck on their breast. But  low and behold, the poor man finally found a rather buxom young girl who  had recently given birth and was willing to help him out--for a price.

The  man was desperate because his condition was growing worse, so he agreed to pay the woman the amount of money she demanded. After all, the woman  had a newborn baby to care for and the father had abandoned them to  their fate.

Well, weeks went by and the awkwardness began to fade.

One  day, the woman realized that the man's suckling was beginning to arouse her sexually. It became almost unbearable and finally, in a sensuous  voice, she said, ""Is there anything else you'd like?""

The man paused in his suckling for a moment, looked up at her, and said, ""Yeah, got any cookies?"" ",There was a gentleman living in a small village,10

“Well, Rabbi, what do you do with the candle drippings?” he asked.

“A good question,” noted the Rabbi. “We actually save them up, and when we have enough we send them back to the candle maker. And every now and then, they send us a free box of candles.”

“Oh,” replied the auditor somewhat disappointed that his unusual question actually had a practical answer.

So he thought he’d go on, in the traditional obnoxious way...

“Rabbi, what about all these cookie purchases? What do you do with the crumbs from the cookies?”

“Ah, yes,” replied the Rabbi calmly, “we actually collect up all the crumbs from the cookies and when we have enough we send them in a box back to the manufacturer. Every now and then, they send a box of cookies.”

“Oh,” replied the auditor, thinking hard how to fluster the Rabbi.

“Well, Rabbi,” he went on, “what do you do with all the foreskins from the circumcisions?”

“Yes, here too, we do not waste,” answered the Rabbi. “What we do is save up all the foreskins and when we have enough we actually send them to the IRS.”

“The IRS?” asked the auditor in disbelief.

“Ahh, yes,” replied the Rabbi, “the IRS. And about once a year they send us a little dick like you.”","A bright, young graduate joined the Internal Revenue Service.",1598

So the man puts down the box and opens it and then he pulls a small piano out of it and places it on the bar and then a little man as well.

The little man walks up to the piano and starts playing !

The barman was blown away by this and agrees to the drinks and asks ""where did you find him?""

“Well “says the man, “I found this magic lamp”. Goes back in to the box and pulls out this old brass oil lamp.

“I rubbed it and a genie appeared and granted me one wish and then he said I must pass the lamp on to the next person that did me a kindness”

“Wow” says the barman.

The man then says “as you gave me a drink I’m going to let you have the lamp”

“Be careful what you wish for tho”

So the barman rubs the lamp and then makes his wish………

Next thing the bar has ducks everywhere!!! Crapping on the bar and the floor and all over the customers!!!!!

From that day on I despised tractors, hated everything about them. Never wanted to see another one in my life, so I moved to the big city. It was ok for a few years. Just regular urban life. Then, local farmers organized a protest downtown and rolled in with at least thirty tractors. Old wounds were ripped open and I walked into the nearest bar where I sat for god knows how many hours.
Then, out of the blue, she took a seat next to me. Prettiest thing I had ever seen. We talked for a while and had a few drinks but she kept coughing and sneezing. It was all the cigarette smoke that was bothering her and I was not going to let that ruin our evening.
So, I finished my beer, took a one deep breath, cleared the whole bar of smoke, held my breath, walked outside and blew all the smoke away.
As I casually strolled back to my seat, she just sat there with eyes wide open and asked how on earth did I do that.

They round-up the leaders of all countries in the world.

 Just to give an example of his intelligence he proclaims that he can touch the genitals of each world leader blindfolded and guess exactly who it is.

 Donald Trump yells out ""fake news"". 

So the leader of the aliens says that he will prove it and if he is wrong the aliens will leave the planet earth. 

They line up all the world leaders and blindfold their leader. He starts with Putin, touches his genitals and yells ""Putin"". Next up is the leader of France, he touches his genitals and yells out ""Its Macron"". He goes through each leader and guessing everyone correctly. 

When he gets to Trump, and as soon as he is about touch his junk, Trump turns around. The alien leader touches him and yells ""It is Angela Merkel"".

 Donald Trump starts jumping around in joy because the alien leader was wrong. And the aliens embarrassed, leave the planet earth to be enventually destroyed by humans.

Well, this was not good news to the cardinals, who argued about it at length. Finally, they went to the Pope with the doctor and explained the situation. After some thought, the Pope stated, “I agree, but under four conditions.”

The cardinals were amazed and there arose quite an uproar. Over the noise a single voice asked, “And what are the four conditions?”

The room stilled. There was a long pause.

The Pope replied, “First, the girl must be blind, so that she cannot see who she is having sex with.

Second, she must be deaf, so that she cannot hear who she is having sex with.

And third, she must be dumb so that if somehow she figures out who she is having sex with, she can tell no one.”

My partner didn't turn up.""

""Sure,""  they said, ""You're welcome."" So they started playing and enjoyed the  game and the company of the newcomer. Part way around the course, one of  the friends asked the newcomer, ""What do you do for a living?""

""I'm a hit man,"" was the reply. 

""You're joking!"" was the response. 

""No,  I'm not,"" he said, reaching into his golf bag, and pulling out a  beautiful Martini sniper's rifle with a large telescopic sight. ""Here  are my tools.""

""That's a beautiful telescopic sight,"" said the  other friend, ""Can I take a look? I think I might be able to see my  house from here."" So he picked up the rifle and looked through the sight  in the direction of his house. ""Yeah, I can see my house all right.  This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see  my wife in the bedroom. Ha Ha, I can see she's naked! What's that? Wait a  minute, that's my neighbor in there with her. He's naked as well! The bitch!"" He turned to the hit man, ""How much do you charge for a hit?""

""I do a flat rate, for you, one thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger."" 

""Can you do two for me now?"" 

""Sure, what do you want?""

I came home to find my mother covered in blood and in shock at the discovery of my father. He had been stabbed multiple times in a garish display akin only to the Manson and Zodiac killings. The police report determined the suspect was between 8-16 inches, slightly boiled but not quite soft, possibly wearing a bow tie and/or ascot but those details remain unclear to this day. Naturally my mother was scared out of her wits and wouldn't even be in the same room as linguine. In the beginning I too had found myself keeping an overly cautious eye towards a bucatini or fettuccine. Eventually I went to therapy and confronted my demons head on, coming to terms with the absence of the one person who I could talk to at any time. I realized that to live in constant fear of an otherwise good people only contributed to the fear-mongering so prominent in today's political climate.  My mother for these last five years has become a recluse. Burdened by the guilt that if only she hadn't stormed out after their fight, dad might not have suffered his untimely end. That is until last night. 

As I walked into the house familiar smells greeted my nostrils. The mildew and slight scent of fresh lavender that my mom always had next to the door mingled with something less familiar. It was foreign and assaulted my senses. Mom was cooking something! Tears welled up in my eyes. She had almost completely stopped buying food for herself, despite my efforts to buy some for her, and instead resorted most days to grabbing fast food. It was starting to show too although I loved her enough not to mention it. The first thing I saw when I walked in the kitchen was a pot on the burner. My mom was by the sink and I greeted her as I walked over and inspected it. Marinara sauce! She must have been cooking chicken too. That was one of her favorites. As she finished emptying the colander she was carrying I began to inquire about the other ingredients but before I could I caught a glimpse of what lay inside and my question was answered. Spaghetti. Loads of it. More than I had ever seen her or anyone make.""What's wrong?"" She crooned. Her toothy grin unsettled me. All I could manage to say was ""That's... that's inpastabowl!""",My mother has an unhealthy fear of noodles.,2

The Son of God warns him that danger is coming his way, and his family will be at risk as well. The priest asks for guidance, and Jesus takes pity on him and says, ""give your blessing to the droplets of my land."" And with that, the priest wakes up. 

The priest is nervous and confused all day long. He knows that that is the best advice he can be given, but he does not know what it means. He is agitated, but keeps his faith and believes the Lord.

That afternoon, he returns home to find his daughter being held hostage by a group of armed men. They tell him that they are a paramilitary group who wish for the fall of all religions, starting with Christianity. The priest is not surprised for the Lord has warned him, yet he does not know what to do. His daughter is scared, her T-shirt of her favorite band is wet with tears and sweat. 

The priest asks how many participants are in this paramilitary group, the gang leader tells him they are over a hundred. The priest asks what they want from him, and they say they will punish him for spreading around religion, and will take his daughter.

He is angry, and protective of his daughter. Looking at her shirt, he suddenly realizes what to do. After years of mastering Hebrew, he finally found a good cause for it. Suddenly, gust of wind bursts through the door and knocks the militants out the window. As they fire their weapons, waters come out of their weapons and lightning hits their weapons out of their hands. Scared and fearful, they flee. 

The priest runs to hug his daughter. His daughter is in tears and is just as afraid as the militants. ""Dad, what happened?""

The father looked caringly at his daughter, glad that she's alive. ""It's going to take a lot more to take me away from you,"" he reassures, ""there's nothing a hundred man or more could ever do.""

The daughter looks confused, so he tells her, ""I blessed the rains down in Africa.""",Made this myself. I'm very proud,8

The wife is expecting him home at around 10am but he doesn't show up. She waits and waits and finally the husband strolls in at around 3pm.

HUSBAND: Honey, I'm so so sorry I'm late. I could make up an excuse but you deserve better, especially on our anniversary, so I'm going to tell you truth. I played 9 holes and then immediately hurried to the car and left the course. As I was on my way home I saw someone pulled over on the shoulder with car trouble. When I got out to help I saw that it was a beautiful woman in lots of distress. I called a tow truck and she begged me to give her a lift home, which I did. Once we got there she was so appreciative that she wanted to ""make it up to me"". I'm so ashamed but I couldn't resist. I ended up in her bed where we made passionate love for hours until I pulled myself away and came home.

The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.

Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""

The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

They never saw the man nor his assistant, only monkeys everywhere!

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'People are still reposting this joke on r/jokes' ",Everyone Knows Dave,66

Last week I had an experience which has left me scared for the rest of my life. Last Friday night I got a notification on my phone that I had matched with Sophia. She was tall, beautiful blonde with a very captivating smile. I messaged her asking if she was down to hook up that night as I didn't have anything to do. Now I wish I never should have sent that message. She replied that she is down for it but only thing is she always hooks up in her own apartment. Not thinking much about it, I said I was fine with it and asked her if she wanted to meet up in public before. She said there is a bar near her house and sent me the address of it. Her place and the bar was on opposite side of town, the part where you would have to look over your shoulders while walking down the street. With not all my blood running to my brain, I agreed to her. We meet an hour later at the bar. Right off the bat, there were some huge red flags. As soon as we met, she was constantly staring at me. I ordered us drinks and proceeded to sit in one corner of the bar. We talked about random stuff and she would stare at my fingers and hands. She would ask questions about whether I was working out and how I would stay in shape. She demanded that she wanted to see my stomach and wanted to feel it. I thought she was just flirting with me and lifted my shirt. She immediately bit her lips and said ""that looks so yummy"". All this while I was thinking this girl is kinkier than I anticipated. How naive was I! She started kissing my fingers and sucking on them. I was bit embarrased by then. But it didn't seem to affect her. Suddenly she started biting my fingers. At first I thought she was being playful but then her biting became more intense. I forcible removed my fingers from her mouth. I was very angry and stood up to leave but as soon as I turned around to leave, there was no bar. No one around. I was suddenly standing in the middle of the forest. I turned towards Sophia and now her whole appearance had changed. I could see her fangs. I could see the blood in her eyes. She said she liked how I tasted and wanted to have all of me and pounced towards me. I fell back on the ground but her sharp nails had already dug dip in my leg. I was shouting for help and trying to kick her off me, but now she started pulling my leg the same I am pulling yours. ",My horrible Tinder date [long],0

Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, ""Moreover, I'm lonely too and need someone to love me."" The girl understood what he meant. But she nodded yes; after all, what did she have to lose?

That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her food and wine and they made passionate love until dawn.

Three weeks later, during a routine search, she was discovered by the captain. ""What are you doing here?"" the captain asked.

In high school he studied and kept his GPA high so he’d be able to go for his dreams: to be a train conductor.  Upon graduating high school he got accepted into a train operator school down in Mobile, Alabama. Good little place, anybody that’s anybody in the southeast US in the train industry went there to learn what they know. He gave it his all and graduated after the end of the 2 year with honors. 

&amp;#x200B;

His family and friends rejoiced with him for he quickly found a job in his field.  The man was ecstatic and on the first day of his job he got in the train car and began to ready the train for his first voyage on the job. He crashes the train within 30 seconds. He’s flabbergasted, the Train Board of Alabama is furious at all the cargo lost and he is fired.  

&amp;#x200B;

Even though he’s upset, he perseveres. He returns to basics and opens his books again, not about to give up on his dreams. He completes a 4 year course this time, ensuring he would succeed. After graduation he gets hired to another agency, this time in Mississippi.

&amp;#x200B;

   First day on the job he checks everything on his train and then sets off. It wasn’t but 10 minutes before the train goes up in smoke and the train derails off a bridge into a lake . Luckily everyone made it out alive, but the train was beyond repair and unable to be retrieved. The Mississippi Train Department fires him and he never returns to the state.  There was still hope for him. In Texas he goes into even more details of study taking them apart and studying every part. He learned the ins and outs of trains better than any man before him in history. He would write essay after essay on train theory, pioneering study for the subject.  After 10 years of this rigorous pursuit of knowledge he graduates from the Texas Institute Of Trains. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ready, determined, and full of hope he sets out to finally get his dream job as a Train Conductor. The Texas Board Of Trains has noticed his quest in the last decade and saw his dedication, they agreed to hire him under one stipulation. If he were to crash another train he would be given the death penalty, as per the Texas way. He agreed, willing to even die for what he believed.   

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly 35 minutes and 10 seconds into his first shift he crashes a train, killing the entire crew except himself, 10 bystanders, and completely destroying the trains engine. The Texas Judicial Department gives him the chair without hesitation.  

———  

When his execution day comes the strap him into the electric chair. He had no last words for them. The executioner pulls the switch, nothing happens. They flicked it a few more times to no avail, being an old chair they shrugged, this was bound to happen eventually after being in service for for 20 years. So they pulled out a spare one they had around in case of these exact circumstances. 

Hook it up. Strap the man in. Pull the switch.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Nothing.    

&amp;#x200B;

Puzzled they get the man back to the cell and call a repairman to take a look at it. “How’d you do it, that spare was used last month and it worked just fine!” The Man's cellmate asked in awe.  

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, I guess you can say I’ve learned I’m not a good conductor.” ",Once there was a boy in Alabama who loved trains.,6

While they're sitting there watching TV in the family room, it isn't so bad because the the football game is on and it's kind of loud.

Also, the parent's big old dog Harold is licking his balls and everyone can hear that, so he can sit there and fart into the couch without anyone hearing a thing.

But then, everybody gets called into the dining room and he still has really bad gas, though he relaxes a little when the dog moves under the table to continue licking his balls.

After a while, he just can't hold it in anymore and to his horror the fart comes out with enough force to rattle the silverware.

Nobody says anything for a moment before the mom yells, ""HAROLD! Get out of there.""

The dog slowly comes out from under the table and goes back to the living room.

The guy is amazed as everybody goes back to eating and talking, they think the dog did it.

A little while later he feels another fart coming, bigger than the first.

He looks around and realizes the dog is back under the table licking its balls again.

So he relaxes and lets the gas go.

This one shakes the table so hard some of the silverware falls off.

Everyone is quiet.

Then, the mom again yells, ""HAROLD, get out of there!""

The dog obediently goes back to the living room.

20 minutes pass and they are about to start on dessert when he feels the mother of all farts trying to punch its way through his colon.

He's really stressed but a quick glance confirms the dog is back under the table!

Feeling confident he just lets it free.

It shakes the silverware.

It shakes the table.

It shakes the windows.

And suddenly everything is quiet.

Until the mom yells, ""DAMMIT, HAROLD. Get out from under that table right now before he shits on you!""","A man goes to his girlfriend's parent's house for Thanksgiving.

The other men in the trench all tell him “hell no”, the last thing they do isn’t gonna be giving someone a blowjob.

The first soldier says “fine”, lights up a cigarette and hops out of the trench and walks off casually with bullets flying all around and grenades going off left and right.

The remaining soldiers figure he’s gonna be dead in a matter of seconds.

About 10 minutes later the soldiers jumps back into the trench and all of the others go up to him and asks him what happened.

“Well, since none of you wanted to help me out, I went and found someone who would”! And he goes into a detailed story about how he found one of the battlefield nurses and they had crazy wild sex in every position you could imagine.

He noticed the car had three political stickers on the bumper; one for Trump, one for Hillary, and one for Johnson. He walked up to his window, asked if he knows why he was pulled over, and out of sheer curiosity he asked the guy why he has the three different bumper stickers.

""I may have been going a bit fast. Who did you support in 2016?""
The officer replied, ""Trump. License and registration please.""

The man pulled out a laminated pepe driver's license and handed it to the officer, who looked at it and laughed. The officer handed it back to the guy and tells him to have a nice day. 

""Build the wall!"" shouted the guy as he drove away

The next day a different officer pulled over the same guy, again for speeding. The officer was perplexed by the bumper stickers. He asked the guy if he knew how fast he was going and why he had the different bumper stickers. 

""I am not sure my speedometer is working  properly. Who did you support in 16?""

The officer replied he was a libertarian and asked the guy for his license and registration. The man responded ""I'm a libertarian too, so we both know this traffic stop, my license and the registration are just additional burdens of taxation against us! A fee every year to drive my car or a speeding ticket is just further feeding big government!""

The officer tipped his hat and said have a nice day.

The next day a different officer pulled over the same guy for speeding. She walked up to the car and noticed the bumper stickers right away. She could see the guy was fastening a something to his lapel. When she got to the window he was wearing a large ""I'm with her"" button. The officer asked the guy if he knew how fast he was going. She stated she was going to ask about the bumper stickers, but the button said it all.

""I guess I was in a daze thinking about how Trump is our president. It's been two years and I still can't believe it.""

The officer asked for the guy's license and registration to which the guy asked, ""How have you been holding up?""

The officer stated she was initially disappointed with the outcome of the election but is looking forward to the next two years after the midterm elections. She then took the guys license and registration and returned with a speeding ticket.

""Wait, you're giving me a ticket? But we both we're Hillary supporters? Can you give me a break just this once?""

The officer replied, ""actually I voted for Stein.""

The guy smiles and pulls out a joint and offers it to the officer.

""Please step out of the car, sir.""","A police officer pulled over a guy who was speeding. He noticed the car had three political stickers on the bumper; one for Trump, one for Hillary, and one for Johnson...",4

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Message from almighty to women (first women because chivalry is not yet dead) and men.

A Woman says to GOD : “I don't want to marry. I am educated, independent, and self sufficient.  I don't need a husband. But my parents are asking me to marry. What do I do?”

GOD replied : “YOU are my finest creation and undoubtedly you will achieve great things. But somethings inevitably will not go the way you want. Somethings will go wrong. Sometimes you will fail. Then who will you blame? 
Will you blame yourself ?”

Woman : “NO...”

GOD : “... That's why you need a husband!”

😝🤣😜😉😂😛

Then the Man says to GOD : “But then what will I do ? Who will I blame ?”

GOD : “Your scope is much wider son. *You can blame the the education system, the legal system, the traffic, the environment, the economy, the politicians, the bureaucrats, the infrastructure, Trump, or even ME...*”
