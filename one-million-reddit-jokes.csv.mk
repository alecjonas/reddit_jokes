A man is spending his first day in prison and is about to go to bed. Right before he falls asleep, he hears a shuffle and all of the Prisoners are awake and shuffling to the edge of their cell. 

One man shouts ""I'll go first. 6821!"" And everyone laughs.

Another man shouts ""Me next! 1320!"" And the prisoners are laughing hysterically.

The man, now confused, gets up and walks over to his cellmate. 

""Hey man. Why is everyone shouting random numbers and why do people laugh after a number is called?""

His cellmate then responds with ""We are telling jokes. We do it every night. There is a book of 9999 jokes that this prison has. Everyone has read the book and memorized it. Instead of retelling the entire joke over again, we just shout out the Joke number. It's easier and we all know what each other are talking about.""

The man loved this idea. He was excited to get his hands on this book. The next morning, he strolled on down to the library and took out the book. He spent the entire day reading all 9999 jokes and picking out his favorites. 

Night time rolled around and once the guards left, the prisoners all got up and walked to the edge of their cell. 

The first prisoner shouted ""8231"" and was followed by laughs.

The next prisoner followed it up by shouting ""3315"" which was caused the prison to burst out into laughter.

The man was now feeling ready. He then shouted ""4712"". The entire prison went silent.

The man was feeling upset and turned to his cellmate and asked ""What's wrong? I read the entire joke book, picked out a funny one and no one laughed. What did I do wrong?"" The cellmate responded with:

""Some people just don't know how to tell jokes.""",My first post on here!,118

See they're all the way up in the trees and we're super small, i think we need some bigger ants to help us get the job done.' 
So the guy's like 'shit i guess i did notice that production's been pretty minimal, i guess i could try to get you some bigger ants. Aren't most of you pretty much all the same size though?' 
And the ant's all 'yo that's racist.'
So they guy's like 'whoa whoa whoa i didn't mean it like that, just relatively in size to a tree. Look i'll go right now to get us some taller ants to help your team.'
So the guy goes to the unemployment center in town and asks around for some tall ants but they've all been hired by other farms that can offer health insurance. He tried to recruit some practice squad players in the ant basketball league but couldnt match their salaries. He even tried to convince an ant warden to give him his tallest ants in a prisoner work release program but the warden wanted a percentage of everything sold and one of the tall ant inmates spit on the guy while he was there, so he decided that wouldn't work either. 
He was walking down the street tired, frustrated, and desperate when he came across a super tall homeless ant holding a 'will work for food' sign. So the guys really excited thinking he's found his solution and explains to the hobo ant that his farmer ants aren't tall enough and the homeless ant starts laughing in his face. 
""Maaaaan you don't need bigger ants, you need smaller trees!"" Said the ant.
The guy was shocked at how simple and elegant the hobo ant's solution was, but also furious that he'd spent an entire day looking for tall ants. He decided he needed a drink to ease his mind so he stopped in the nearest bar. 
So the guy goes to the bartender, ""hey barkeep lemme get 4 shots of the strongest booze you got.""
And the bartender's like ""brother i've got some moonshine that'll melt your face off but it's crazy strong, you sure you want 4 shots?""
And the guy says, ""look man i've had a nightmare of a day, i know my limits, trust me i can handle my shit.""
So the bartender's like ""allright man if you insist"" and he lines up four shots of the moonshine and the guy wastes no time and throws em back, one after another, slams down the fourth shot glass, and then immediately projectile vomits all over the bar, including on the bartender.
The bartender's fuckin piiiiiiissed and yells ""what the fuck man!? You said you could handle your shit!! What is your problem!?!?""

Suzy is surprised, and a little taken back, ""I didn't think you were going to ask me. Yes, I would love to go with you!"" 
""Really?! Oh boy, ok!"" And our hero Billy runs off to get ready, except he waited too long... 

Billy first went to the tuxedo rental shop to get a suit, but it was the day before and there was a 2 hour line. After waiting the 2 hours he finally gets to the front and asks for a tux. 
""We're all out"", said the clerk bluntly. 
""Oh, no, you don't understand. Suzy, the prom! I need a suit!"" cries Billy. 
""OK OK, there is one but it's a week old, hasn't been washed. There's puke In one of the pockets, the crotch seam is bus-"" 
""I'll take it."", Billy insists, and off he goes to the flower store where there was another 2 hour line! After another tedious wait he gets to the front only to be informed they had no more flowers at all. 
""But the prom! Suzy!"" Billy protested. 
""Ok, fine. There's this corsage from a few days ago someone didn't pick up. It's falling apart and withered, I'm pretty sure it was for a funeral which I didn't know was a thing... But full price, sorry."" Billy accepts and takes his prize, then bounds off to the limo rental. But you guessed it, another 2 hour line... Finally he gets to the front, but the guy is closing shop, and Billy makes his desperate plea.
""I must have a limo for Suzy tomorrow, please help me sir!"". Begrudgingly, the man acquiesces. 
""There's one but you're not gonna like it. Bachelor party gone wrong... 'Rode hard and put away wet' is on the tag. We might have to scrap it.""
Billy said, ""I'll take it."" 

The next evening Billy gathers up his tokens and heads off to meet his lady. He arrives at her house, her father answers the door and gives him a mean mug. Suzy descends the staircase. Back-lit slow motion to a power ballad. She is resplendent, the image of beauty. 
""Wow Suzy you look amazing."" 
""So... Do you, Billy."" Suzy replied, looking him up and down. 
""Shall we go?"" said Billy. 
""Yes, let's."" said Suzy. 

They arrive at the dance and have a wonderful time. They saw friends and laughed and even had a special moment. That one song was playing, and the lighting was just right. Suzy closed her eyes and leaned in, they shared their first kiss. 
""Billy I've had such a great time tonight. Thank you for everything you've done for me, you really made me feel special... I- I think I love you, Billy"" 
""Wow Suzy, you mean it?""
""Yea, I do."" 
""Well, I love you too Suzy. I'm so happy."" 
""Me too. All of this dancing has got me parched, would you get me something to drink?"" 
""Of course, anything for you!""

The little 10-year-old girl does not eat and has her nose in her plate….

After a few moments, she says, “I’ve something to tell you people”
Silence around the table.
“I’m no longer virgin”, and she begins to cry.
A long silence again. 

And then… 
The father screams at his wife, 
“It’s your fault! 
Always dressed and made up like a whore! 
Do you think you are setting a good example for your daughter?
Wallowing the whole day on the sofa, exposing your pussy… 
it’s disgusting! 
That’s how problems arrive”

The wife, in turn yells at her husband: 
“What about you ?
Are YOU setting a good example ?
Wasting your salary on sluts who sometimes even accompany you to your doorstep!
Are YOU setting a good example for your 10-year-old daughter?”

The father continues”
“And her elder sister, this good-for-nothing, 
With her hairy junkie of a boyfriend, 
Who is always groping her in all the corners of the house, 
Do you believe she is setting a good example for her younger sister?”

And the recriminations go on, and on, and on….

The grandmother touches the shoulder of the little granddaughter to console her 
And asks her :
“Well, my little girl, how did it happen?”

And the little girl replies while stifling her sobs :
“it’s the priest”

The grandmother asks : 
“What do you mean, the priest ?”

“The priest has chosen another girl to be Virgin Mary in the Christmas play…
I’m no longer playing the role of Virgin Mary”",Like a virgin,45

The beauty of the queen was world renown and was a thing of extreme pride for the king. But, one thing that gave the king extreme head ache was that he doubted his queen. He was paranoid that she was sleeping with someone else in the palace, may be one of his ministers. He suspected the chief minister the most as he was quiet a handsome fellow. Day by day, the king's doubt grew and festered in his mind, causing him to be extremely agitated and unhappy. He wanted to find out who in his palace was sleeping with her, so that he can kill them and be cured of this misery. So, he called up the great sage of his country and told him his problem. The sage, after some deliberation, came up with a solution. He told the king to hide a piece of sharp blade in the queens vagina when the queen was asleep. Then, after some days, he can ask the ministers to show him their dicks. The one who has a cut on his dick is the one sleeping with the queen. The king was satisfied with this idea and decided to go through with it. the next day, he found one of the sharpest blades in his country and placed it inside the queen's vagina when she was asleep. The king decided to wait one month, even thought the saint said just a few days, as he didn't want the culprit to escape due to chance. So, one month later, he gathered up all the ministers of his court in a large room and told them to remove their pants and show their dicks one by one. The ministers were surprised as the king didn't tell them what it was all about and confusingly pulled their dicks out. The king was surprised that he found out the culprit easily as the first minister he checked had a cut on his dick. The king was enraged. He couldn't believe that the queen was sleeping with this fat trash minister. He was about to order the guards to capture this minister and behead him, when he chanced to glance the dick of the second minister. The king was shocked to see a cut on his dick aswell. The king then looked at the third minister and there again it was, a mark on his dick. So the king continued looking and found out that all his ministers had cut on their dick. He was enraged and wanted to know the extend of his slutty queens lust. So, he ordered the palace guards to undress aswell. Surprisingly, or rather not surprisingly, every single palace guard too had a cut on their dick. The king was absolutely down after finding out that his beautiful wife, who was his pride, was sleeping with every man in the palace, even the old palace cook. As the king was contemplating suicide, the chief minister, who was late to work that day, just walked in to find every man in the palace standing without their pants, with their dicks out. He went to one of the ministers and enquired what this was all about. When he found out that the king was inspecting everyones' dicks, he went to the king and pulled out his dick. The king saw the chief minister pull out his dick, but didn't have the mind to look. His mind was already shattered and he didn't want to subject it to more torture. But, all the other ministers insisted that the king look at the chief ministers' dick as well, so the king gave the dick a look, but was surprised to find no cut mark on it anywhere. The king grabbed it and inspected it thoroughly but he couldn't find even a wrinkle on the pristine dick. He was overjoyed that he could find someone in the palace who didn't sleep with his life, but was soon filled with guilt as he had suspected the chief minister the most. He got emotional and told one of the servants to bring a horse cart full of gold and give it to the chief minister. All of the ministers , including the chief minister, the soldiers, servants and everyone present there were surprised at this command. The chief minister didn't understand why the king ordered this gift for him, but was extremely happy and thankful to the king. Filled with extreme joy and happiness, the chief minister went to the king, grabbed his hands and said with a painful face...

They promised any officer who volunteered for retirement a bonus of $1,000 for every inch measured in a straight line between any two parts of his body.

The officer got to choose what those two points would be. The first officer who accepted, asked that he be measured from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. He was measured at six feet and walked out with a bonus of $72,000.

The second officer who accepted was a little smarter and asked to be measured from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. He walked out with $96,000.

The third one was a grisly old Chief who, when asked where he would like to be measured replied, ""from the tip of my weenie to my testicles.""

It was suggested by the pension man that he might want to reconsider, explaining about the nice big checks the previous two officers had received But the old Chief insisted and they decided to go along with him, providing the measurement was taken by a medical officer.

The medical officer arrived and instructed the Chief to ""drop 'em,"" which he did. The medical officer placed the tape measure on the tip of the Chief's weenie and began to work back.

Oh Man!"" he suddenly exclaimed, ""Where are your testicles?""
The old Chief calmly replied... ""Vietnam.""","It was a time of cost cutting, &amp; every Govt. Dept. had been told to scale back the overheads.",83

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost, and being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.
 
I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight.
 
There were only the diggers and crew left, and they were eating lunch. I felt bad, and apologized to the men for being late.
 
I went to the side of the grave and looked down, and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.
 
The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends.
 
I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.
 
And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full.
 
As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for 20 years.""",The Bagpiper,3

Chuck picked up some paint from the hardware store and began working his way around the chapel. 


   By mid-afternoon he had finished 3 sides of the building but was quickly running out of paint. The job almost finished, and wanting to avoid a second trip to the store, Chuck thinned the remaining paint with some turpentine and finished the last wall.


   Immediately after applying  the very last brush stroke, Chuck heard a horrendous clap of thunder, and the sky opened up.


   The downpour washed the paint off the walls and knocked Chuck off his scaffold and onto the lawn among the gravestones and puddles of now worthless paint.


   Incensed, Chuck shook his fist at the sky and screamed  ""Father! I spent my whole Saturday hard at work, in your service, painting your church! Why did you send this storm and ruin everything that I accomplished today?!""


   And from the thunder, a mighty voice replied: “REPAINT! AND THIN NO MORE!”

The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighborhood after they retired. Holding hands, they walked back to their old school. It was not locked, so they entered. They found the old desk they'd shared, where Jerry had carved ‘I love you, Sally’. 

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars! 

Jerry said, ""We've got to give it back.""

 Sally said, ""Finders keepers."" She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic. 

The next day, two police officers, who were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, knocked on their door. ""Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?"" 

Sally said, ""No."" 

Jerry said, ""She’s lying. She hid it up in the attic."" 

Sally said, ""Don't believe him, he’s getting senile."" 

The officers turned to Jerry and began to question him. 
One said: ""Tell us the story from the beginning."" 

Jerry said, ""Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday......."" 

The officer turned to his partner and said, ""That's enough. Let’s get out of here.""",Don't assume the elderly are senile,23

The teacher asked Mr Abbott if he would like to lead the discussion on the word 'Tragedy'. So our illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a 'Tragedy' A little boy stood up and offered: 'If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playin' in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy.' 'Incorrect,' said Abbott. 'That would be an accident.' A little girl raised her hand: 'If a school bus carrying fifty children drove over a cliff, killing everybody inside, that would be a tragedy.' 'I'm afraid not explained Abbott, 'that's what we would refer to as a great loss'. The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Abbott searched the room. 'Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?' Finally, at the back of the room, little Johnny raised his hand and said: 'If a plane carrying you and Mr Hockey, Mr Pyne and Mrs Bishop was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile &amp; blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.' 'Fantastic' exclaimed Abbott, 'and can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?'

Noah is confused, and the snakes admit that they've had some trouble.

""Is there anything I can do to help?"" he asks.

The snakes look at each other, and then turn back to Noah. ""If you could cut down that tree over there,"" says one, ""that would help quite a bit.""

Noah doesn't quite understand, but cuts down the tree anyway, and leaves to continue his journey. A year later, he goes to check the progress of all the animals. The are more foals, more pups, more cubs, and tons of other baby animals. He gets to the snakes, and sure enough, there are baby snakes everywhere.

He approaches the vehicle, and begins the usual interrogation. ""Sir, did you know how fast you were going back there?"" ""Yes, I did, I got places to be!"" The man replies. The Officer is a little taken aback, but not surprised. He was trained on how to deal with this.  ""What do you have planned sir? It can't be more important than breaking the law."" The man ponders that, and than replies ""I got to bury the body I got in my trunk."" This is a surprise, but he keeps calm. ""How did the person in your trunk die sir?"" ""I shot him. With the gun I got in the glove compartment."" The officer is now shocked, and scared. He tells the man to stay put, and calls for backup. Another police car shows up, with a more seasoned officer. He handcuffs the man, and begins to search the car. First he checks the glove compartment, and finds nothing. Than, he moves on to the trunk, and finds no trace of a body. The seasoned officer is annoyed with the new officer, and apologizes to the man. ""I am sorry that you had to undergo this harassment, sir, I had no idea that officer would deceive me like this."" The man replies. ""It's all good officer. That kid was so crazy, I bet he told you I was speeding too!""",A man gets pulled over.,17

He announces to the bar that this octopus can not only talk, but he has a very unique talent which he will share with the crowd for $50 a turn.

Bartender says ""There's no way that octopus can talk.""

""Sure he can. Ollie, tell the nice folks you can talk."" says Bob.

""He's right,"" says Ollie the Octopus, ""I can talk. I can also play any musical instrument.""

""True story!"" Says Bob the sailor ""...but if you wanna test him, you've gotta pay 50 bucks a try!""

One fella reaches into his pocket and says ""Here's $50, and my harmonica."" Ollie plays a long, slow, mournful song that quiets the bar and brings a tear to the eye of everyone with a heart not made of stone. This is truly amazing, especially since octopi are devoid of lips.
Jimmy runs out to his car and grabs his fiddle. He hands it to Ollie with a crisp $50 bill. Ollie picks up the fiddle and plays a lively jig that has boots stomping and hands slapping tables. The mood has improved and folks are buying rounds for Ollie and Bob.

Seamus, an old, crusty Scotsman hobbles over to Bob and says ""Aye boy, ye plannin' on bein' here for a spell?""

""Sure we are!"" say Bob and Ollie in unison.

""Good then. I'll be right back.""

And off Seamus goes into the evening.

Bob and Ollie have a few more drinks, Ollie plays a few more instruments, and everyone sings a few more songs.

About an hour later, Seamus casts a dark shadow at the tavern door. Clutched under his arm is the most magnificent set of Great Highland Bagpipes you've ever seen. Dark polished wood for the chanter, mouthpiece, and three drones.

The cover was done in rich corduroy, slightly worn from the years of use.

Ollie's eyes widened in suprise.

Seamus gently placed the pipes down on the bar beside Ollie with a wry grin and quietly said ""Now m'boy...what're ye gonna do with that!?""
Ollie was speechless. He ran his tentacles over the individual pieces, exploring the instrument. He felt the cloth, the wood, the finger holes. He'd never seen anything like this.

Seamus got louder. ""Come ON ye silly cephalopod!"" which was strange for Seamus to say, being as though he only had a third grade education. ""What're ye gonna do with this now?!""

Ollie looked as Seamus, and with determination in his eyes he said:

""I'm going to make love to her. Just as soon as I figure out how to get her pajamas off!""",Bob the Sailor &amp; Ollie the Octopus walk into a bar...,43

As he is driving to the golf course, God and St Peter are looking down at him from heaven. St Peter says ""look at that! Can you believe him? Skipping mass! Are you going to punish him lord?""

""Of course"" said God.

The priest arrives at the golf course, and it's completely deserted when he steps onto the course. He puts the ball on the tee and gets ready to play

Meanwhile, St Peter looks on with glee. He can only imagine how God will punish the priest. Breaking his clubs? A bolt of lightning? The priest hits the ball, it sails into the air... And lands straight into the hole.

The priest is ecstatic. St Peter is shocked. ""You did that didn't God? Why? I thought you were going to punish him?"" God just stays silent.

The day goes on, the priest still plays. Every hole he plays, God makes him get a hole in one. The priest is so happy, he has the time of his life. As he's driving home, St Peter turns to God.

""He's had a fantastic day... This is his punishment for skipping mass?""

The priest arrives home. Later that day, the priest who filled in for him shows up to check on him.

""How are you father?"" he says.

""How am I? Let me tell you the day I had! I went....""
