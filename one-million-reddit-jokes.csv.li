The man thinks: ""What does a priest know about sex?""

So he goes to a minister who, after all, is a married man and experienced in this matter.
He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and therefore not for the Sabbath!

Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out a Rabbi, a man of thousands of years of tradition and knowledge. 

The Rabbi ponders the question, then states, ""My son, sex is definitely play.""

I've gone through the Top voted posts on r/jokes &amp; ended my research. I'm going to make a long pointless story that is that makes no sense but is META and will have twists with the stupidest final twist. And my quest starts here. Here begins my post:

There was a man who always tried to be the funniest guy anywhere he goes. He gathered tons of jokes, memorised them, mixed them and matched them and always came up with witty ideas spot-on to make others burst but it still didn't make him satisfied.  
Then one day, he found r/jokes. He saw tons and tons of jokes every day every hour. He found many of them funny. He stole ideas from them and made his own jokes and posted it. He even spent nearly 3 minutes every day reposting jokes with making small changes. Many of them got thousands of updoots and managed to tickle the redditors but as time grew on he felt he had to have a post that makes it to the front page and then only he eill be satisfied. He tried to make jokes based on the trending stuff but either he failed or he was too late. He started posting, reposting more and even more on different months, different days and different hours but at his best he could only manage to make a joke that would make a person laugh out loud for 5 seconds. Now that's a great achievement, one many of the redditors envy but no he wasn't satisfied. He wanted a joke that would literally make the reader burst out laughing in tears and roll over the floor until he/she suffocates and makes his/her face go purple.  

He decided he would do anything for it, go anywhere and spend all of the money he have. He started to search and research and search more and then he got to know about a Buddhist monk, from the internet, who lived far away deep into the Nepal jungles. This monk had the special ability to make anyone in this world at any situation laugh with his jokes. But to find him one must go through the deep jungles and caves without eating anything and fighting off the dangerous animals that are on the way.  
He went to Nepal to find the monk. He went through the jungles and caves, fighting tigers and snakes and elephants, burning poisonous plants he was tired and exhausted when he finally reached his destination. He found the monk. The monk and the people their welcomed him with delicious food and plenty of drinks. He rested there and slept for hours.  

The next day he woke up and without any delay he went to find the monk. He found the monk sitting on his podium surrounded by many others. He tells his tales while cracking some jokes and the crowd roars aloud laughing and after awhile he found himself laughing uncontrollably.  
After the session ended, he went near the monk. The monk greeted him and said, ""I know the reason to you being here!"". He replied ""Oh well then monk. I've never seen someone as witty as you. I need to as- "" The monk interrupted ""Before I answer any of your questions, you must do what I tell you. I need you to travel around the world, visit every continent and search for The 5 Holy Teachers and kiss their foot. Then I will fulfill your needs and answer your questions"".  
He replied, ""But how will I ever know..""  
Monk, ""Don't worry, your intuition will lead the way"".

As determined as he could be he started his journey. A small step in his ultimate quest. He travelled through the oceans Pacific and Atlantic through the Indian through the rough seas, the cold mountains couldn't stop him, dragged himself through the deserts, heights never made him fear. No water, no Sun, no animals no clouds no wind no mountains nothing stopped him. He finally ended his journey, travelled through the continents, found the holy teachers and returned back to the monk. The monk greeted him with a smile on his face. ""I must say, I'm really impressed with your effort and determination for your quest"", the monk said.  
He replied, ""I have finally did it. It's my lifelong dream to get the answers."" 
Monk, ""Yes and I will give you the answers that you require. Now bring your ears near me""  
He was really anticipated of the answers he seek. He was excited and trembling he brought his ears near to the Buddhist's mouth. The Buddhist uttered the words to his ears.  
.....Now I could tell you the joke but after all he went through I think you must find it out yourself... okay I was kidding, continuing with the story.  
The monk told, ""Ask your wife"". ""wot?"", confused he asked back.  
""Ask your wife. She will tell you where it is.""  
He pulled himself back and confused he lied on the ground and he saw the trees around spinning. The whole clouds come crashing down on him. He shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK?"" and suddenly opened his eyes. He found himself on his bedroom. It was ALL a dream.  

He got up and went to the dining room. He washed his face and then a voice came from the back, ""You woke up?"". It was his wife. He looked at her face for a moment. She asked if he was okay. He told her he saw a dream and explained the whole story to her.  
""Maybe it was a dream but I should ask you, what is the *REAL* answer? What is it? Where can I find my answer""  
The wife came close and said, ""Honey, tbh you making a posts with thousands of upvotes on r/jokes was a joke itself but I think you have missed the biggest point here. After all this you still haven't figured it out. I think the dream was true.""  
With tears in his eyes he asked, ""Tell me, what is it? Once and for all please tell me. My mind is really disturbed""  
... The wife says,  
        ""No matter what you post, the real joke is always in the comments""

________________________________
E/U : He looks into her deep black eyes thinking, ""What the hell was I doing all along? Fuming my head to make a pointless stupid joke so that I could get fake internet points"" ""What the heck am I doing?!""  
.  
And I snapped my head, indulged in my thoughts, looking into the white screen before me;  WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST TYPE? ..  looking deep .. into.. looking into.. the reflection ... looking into my own reflection..    ""my own reflection""  *Now thats* thejoke.jpg

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned ☝her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

post,7krwl8,2qh72,jokes,false,1513670688,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7krwl8/the_heroic_homeless_man/,self.jokes,,"It’s December 2012, and Christmas is fast approaching. The snow is on the trees, gifts are being bought, and the lake in Central Park is frozen over. Children and the stents are skiing on the ice, having a great time. However suddenly, a little girl falls through the ice. Luckily, a nearby homeless man used to be a professional diver. The homeless man jumps in the water and saves the little girl.

Not long after, a man in a limousine, wearing a sharp suit drives up to the homeless man. The man in the suit tells the homeless man “That little girl you just saved was my daughter! What can I do to repay you?”. The homeless man insists no reward, because of his generosity. The man in the suit sneakily puts $10 in the homeless mans pocket, just so that the homeless man isn’t left without reward. 

A few days later, the homeless man finds the $10 in his back pocket. He thinks “Well, I’ve got the money now. Might as well use it”..The homeless man then goes into a travel agency, slams the $10 on the counter and requests a holiday. The lady behind the desk is quite shocked, however she has been working at the agency for 50 years, and not once has she failed to deliver. The lady goes into the back office and finds a holiday for $10. It’s a cruise on a luxury boat, sailing from the US to the UK. However there’s a catch...

The reason the trip is so cheap is because the homeless man must stay in the ships cargo hold. He is not allowed to go up onto main deck, as someone might see him. The homeless man agreed to this of course, because it’s a holiday nonetheless. So eventually the day of the cruise comes around. The homeless man goes into the cargo hold and is left to his own devices. 

At night, after day 1, the homeless man feels rebellious, so he goes up to the top deck, which is abandoned because all the passengers are sleeping, and he starts using the diving board and the pool, he does tricks and whatnot, because as we know, he is a former professional diver. 

The captain of the cruise spots the homeless man doing all these tricks, and rather than giving him into trouble, he sees an opportunity. The captain asks the homeless man “Sir, we have a big water show coming up on the last day of the cruise. Would you like to show off your skills? In return, you get a free ticket to come on the returning cruise”. Of course, the homeless man agrees to this, as he has no other way to get home. However, the homeless man has one condition. The captain must build a giant diving board, that goes all the way up into space, so that his tricks seem more impressive. The captain agrees to this.

It’s the day of the water show! The homeless man walks on the top deck, and he begins climbing the ladder to the diving board. He goes up and up, passing cloud level, then the international space station. Eventually he reaches the top. He is almost touching the moon. The homeless man summons the courage and then jumps off. The speck of blue that is earth enlarges as he falls (let’s just ignore gravity, by the way). Soon the ocean is visible, then the ship, then the ships pool. The homeless man hits the pool, and goes straight through the bottom. He goes through 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class. He passes the boiler room and goes out the bottom of the ship. He hits the earth surface, and drills into the earth core. 

The homeless man swims back up to the boat and everyone is clapping, they are all amazed! 

A little girl approached the homeless man and asks “Mister, how on earth did you do that? That was crazy!”, to which the homeless man replies:

“Well little girl, I’m no stranger to going through hardships”",The Heroic Homeless Man,32

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......
But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

I work there with a friend of mine from Gwynedd name Yraes (pronounced Urr-Ice).
He’s kind of a shitlord, he always gives our manager a hard time (constantly pranks people).
Couple of years ago Yraes put “never gonna give you up” in the DJ’s playlist and not that long ago he replaced a bottle of Smirnoff with vinegar, still don’t know how he isn’t fired.
So last Friday I open up the club and get hit with a swarm of flies , as I walk inside I see thousands of the fuckers flying everywhere.
I instantly called my manager Iw (pronounced Yoo, fucking Welsh names).
Turns out some retard forgot to clean the sinks out on Sunday and a shit tonne of flies laid their eggs in there.
So I called an exterminator and he said there’s probably between 8-12 million of the fuckers alive, and it will take 5-7 hours to kill most of them… we open in 3 hours. 
Fuck it, the show must go on. 
I spend the entire night running around swatting flies, I must have killed a thousand of the bastards (I felt like the Rambo of flies).
By the end of the night I am exhausted and ready to pass out, I pour some rubbing alcohol down the sink to kill as many eggs as possible and go to my car, debating on whether to sleep in it tonight.
Yraes comes outside and screams “the sinks on fire!” 
Naturally I thought he was joking (since he is a prankster)
He says “no, I’m serious it’s on fire. I put my cigarette out in the sink and it caught fire.
Sure as heck there are now flames inside, so I open the doors and see thousands of bugs, on fire, flying out the sink.
“Jesus call Iw!” I said.
He calls the manager and she hangs up on him, thinking it’s a prank.
At this point the club is fully engulfed in flames and we had to get out, and I cannot give a single fuck.
I went back to my car to sleep.
My friend Yraes is still trying to get a hold of Iw.
Iw would not believe Yraes
If ten million fire-flies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep.

The next day, Arti tailed the man's wife to a supermarket, which was the perfect time to kill her. He choked her to death and was about to make a getaway when he saw the store supervisor witnessed the whole thing. Wanting to cover his tracks, he choked the supervisor too.

But as luck would have it, Arti's crime was caught by the shop's security cameras. In no time, he was arrested by the cops. The press got wind of it. A local daily then ran the following headline ""Arti chokes 2 for $5 in supermarket"".

The angels hear their prayers, and, deeply moved, decide to help. They ask God for advice. God is busy, so he abruptly replies: ""Give them some rain.""

The angels try their hardest, but they can't make rain without heavy cloud cover. They return, telling him as much. God replies: ""Well, make it snow!""

Unfortunately for the angels, they are also unable to change the temperature to the right conditions for snow-making. They again return to God for advice, and he replies, ""If you can't deal with the atmosphere, then go up to the mountain springs and make the streams and rivers overflow with water."" The angels go out to look for springs, but there's only one in the vicinity, and it's so far away that it's completely useless to the villagers. They return yet again, reporting their failure.

A guy goes into a bar in New York where all the bartenders are robots:

The guy sits down at the bar and the robot asks: “What will you have?

The guy replies, “Whiskey.” The robot brings back his drink and asks, “What’s your IQ?”

The guy say, “168”

The robot talks about physics, space exploration, and medical
technology.

After the guy leaves, he pauses at the street corner and thinks about what he just encountered, and the more he thinks about it the more curious he gets, so he decides to go back.

The robot asks, “What’s your drink?”

The guy answers, “Whiskey.”

The robot returns with his drink and asks, “What’s your IQ?”

This time the man replies, “100.”

The robot talks about Nascar, Budweiser, LSU and All-star Wrestling.

The man finishes his drink, leaves, but is so interested in this

“experiment” that he decides he'll try again.

He enters the bar and, as usual, the robot asks him what he wants to drink.

The man replies, “Whiskey.”

The robot brings the drink and asks, “What’s your IQ?”

This time the man answers, “50.”

The robot leans in real close and slowly asks,""So, are you people still unhappy that Hillary lost?”",Robot bartender,0

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Dave (I repost this because its hilarious),215

He smashes the ball and it is heading right for the water hazard before the green. Moses raises his club, the water parts, and the ball makes it to the green. Jesus gets up to swing, cranks it out, and it is headed for the water hazard. Jesus closes his eyes and prays. The ball skips across the water and lands on the green two feet from the hole. The old man's turn comes and he drives the ball. The ball looks like it is going to drop directly into the water. A fish jumps from the water hazard swallowing the ball, as an eagle drops from the sky, grabbing the fish. As the eagle flies over the green, a bolt of lightning strikes the eagle, making it drop the fish. As the fish hits the green, it spits out the ball and the ball falls into the hole, making a hole in one.

post,7kfmk3,2qh72,jokes,false,1513537424,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7kfmk3/the_piano_bar_joke/,self.jokes,,"A bar owner decides to make his place a piano bar. He hires a pianist, buys a baby grand, shuts down the bar and has it redecorated. He talks to one of his friends and says,”Man, I hope this place goes over, I’m kind of worried no one will come.” The friend says, “Well, have a grand opening. Advertise and get the word out.” The bar owner takes his advice, but then the day before opening, his piano player reneges and takes off to Chicago. The barman tells his friend “Oh Jesus, now what!? All that money for refurbishing and advertisement, how can I open a piano bar without a pianist.!?” A guy walking by hears him yelling, looks in and says ” Excuse me, did you need a pianist? I’m a piano player, I play really good, and even write my own songs.” The barman asks him to audition. The pianist sits down at the baby grand and starts playing, and it’s a really good song. The barman asks him if he wrote the song and the pianist says that he did. The bar owner asks the name and the pianist says “I call that one ‘Sit on my face, baby’.” The barman is taken aback, but asks him to play another. He plays a really good tune, but then says that the name of it is ‘I stepped in a pile of dog shit’. He plays a few more, and they’re all great, but have foul names. The barman says, “Look, I’ll give you the job on the condition that you never announce the name of your songs.” The pianist agrees, and says he’ll be there for the  grand opening. Grand opening night is a great success, the piano player is very popular, and he jokes with the crowd, sips a little wine, really gets everybody into it. At his break he goes into the rest room, and when he comes back, a lady says, “Mister, do you know your zipper’s down and your dick is hanging out?” The pianist smiles and says, “Know it? Hell, I wrote it!”",The piano bar joke,6

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

3. Fuck the ugliest woman in the world

  The American did splendidly on the 1st task. For next one he did bravely and brought back teeth of the Lion after 10 minutes of furious fight. But when he went in to the 3rd door, he gave up. 

    Now the Russian just had to finish the 3 tasks and win. He went in laughing for the 1st challenge and in minutes finished the task. But he looked nervous going in to the 2nd. However he gathered courage and went in. People could hear the screams and anticipated the worst. After 30 gruelling minutes the Russian came out,scratches all over and bloody. And asked,

A cop notices how fast he is going and pulls him over. The cop says to the man, ""Are you aware of how fast you were going?"" 

The man replies, ""Yes I am. I'm trying to escape a robbery I got involved in."" 

The cop gives him a skeptical look and says, ""Were you the one being robbed?"" 

The man casually replies, ""No, I committed the robbery."" 

The cop looks shocked that the man admitted this. ""So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"" 

""Yes,"" the man calmly says. ""I have the loot in the back.""
 
The cop begins to get angry. ""Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me."" The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man. 

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says. 

The cop calls for backup. Soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. The man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. However, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""Sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However, we found none of these things in your car.""

This site is strange enough, but by far the strangest thing about this scene is that the officer SWEARS that he saw this little old lady in the front seat knitting away. So he puts on his lights, and catches upto the car.

The Officer watches this lady, still swerving and speeding and, sure enough, knitting away, and despite the lights she doesnt even attempt to pull over. 

'Perhaps she just doesn't see me?' Thinks the officer

So he gives her a blast of the siren. And then another. And another. And still, she just sits there, no hands on the wheel, just knitting away.

'Maybe she's deaf, or just has her music up too loud to hear me?'

Not wanting to PIT this poor old lady the Officer decides that the best thing to do is to pull up beside her and get her attention. SURELY she'll stop then. So he speeds up, matching speed with the car. He watches as the old lady notices him, lights flashing and siren blaring, and is FLOORED when she just smiles, and waves before returning to her knitting.

The officer tries getting her attention again, this time motioning her to roll her window down. She sees him and after a second of confusion at the strange sight before her rolls her window down and yells over.

'It's a beautiful day for a drive Officer'. Then she just returns to her knitting business.

The Officer is just flabbergasted. So after a few moments of shock and awe, he yells back 'Pull over'

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

post,7k9pxz,2qh72,jokes,false,1513460219,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7k9pxz/the_purple_dragon_long/,self.jokes,,"There was a boy walking to school one day, and on his way to school a bully beat him up and knocked him to the ground. As the kid was laying on the ground the bully spit in his face and called him a purple dragon. The boy wasn’t sure what it meant, but he just dusted himself off and headed to school. 

When the boy walked into his class his teacher noticed how scraped and bruised he was and asked him what happened to him. He said, “A bully beat me up and called me something I haven’t heard before.” The teacher told him to say the word, so he said, “He called me a purple dragon.” The teacher screamed at him, “GO TO THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE RIGHT NOW!”

As the kid made it to the principal’s office he decided he won’t make the mistake of saying “purple dragon” again. The principal calls him in asking, “You’re never in my office. What is it that you did that could’ve gotten you sent here?” “Well I was beaten up on the way to school and the kid called me something, so when I told the teacher what he said she sent me here.” The principal was very curious as to what could’ve gotten him in so much trouble. “What was the word? I promise if you tell me you won’t get in any trouble. I just want to know what was said.” The kid thought for a second and told him, “I don’t know if that’s a good idea considering the trouble it got me into with the teacher.” The principal responded, “I’ve been a principal for quite a few years now and I’ve heard everything kids your age can come up with.” The kid decided it was okay to tell him, “He called me a purple dragon.” 

The principal had a look on his face as if the child had said he killed a puppy. After a moment of silence the principal told him he’s expelled and he never wants to see his face again. The kid is sent home immediately without any further discussion.

As the kid makes it home his mom asks him why he’s home so early. He asks in return, “Can it wait until dad gets home? I don’t think I can talk about it quite yet.” The mother sees how distraught he is and sends him up to his room until his father gets home.

A few hours later his father comes into his room and wraps and arm around the boy. “What’s wrong? Why were you sent home early?” The kid worked up the courage to tell him, “On the way to school a bully beat me up and called me something. When I told the teacher she sent me to the principal, and the principal expelled me when I said it to him. The father asked him what the word was that could have gotten him into so much trouble. “Well I don’t think I should say it considering I was expelled for it.” The father laughed and replied, “Your older brothers have said many many words that should never come out of their mouths. I doubt it’s as big of a deal as you think.” The boy decided his father was right and said, “He called me a purple dragon.”

The father grabbed his son by the neck and hissed through his teeth, “I disown you. You’re no longer my son. If I ever see you in this house again you’ll regret it.” After that he threw the kid out the second story window where upon impact with the ground he broke his leg.

After about 8 years of wandering, he decided he needed to make something of his life. By then his leg was healed and he decided to join the army.

During his first day at basic training the drill sergeant was asking everyone why they were there. When he got to the boy he asked, “Why the hell are you here?!” The boy told him, “Well I was disowned by my family, expelled from school when I was ten and I figured this would give me a better life sir.” The drill sergeant seemed shocked by his sob story and asked him what caused all of his misfortune. “Well one day on my way to school some kid beat me up and called me something I still haven’t found out the meaning to sir.” The drill sergeant orders him to tell him, “What the hell did that kid call you?!” The guy answers, “I don’t want to say it considering my past.” The officer chuckles responding with, “I’ve heard everything you can think of boy. I’ve heard words in my two decades of service that would make a sailor blush.” “He called me a purple dragon.” As the last word of his sentence leaves his mouth, the drill sergeant pulls out his pistol and shoots him in the foot. “Get the hell out of here! You’re no longer allowed in the army, and I’d be surprised if anyone would give you a job with that kind of language!”

After the boy put some distance between him and basic training, he sits down now thinking about all that’s happened to him. He reaches into his pocket and notices he has a $10 bill. He looks across the road at McDonald’s and says to himself, “I might as well have one last meal.” As he’s crossing the street he gets hit by a car and dies on impact.

The moral of the story is: Look both ways before you cross the road.",The Purple Dragon (long),3

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more.

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where.

Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.

Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum.

When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.

Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?'

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’",Grandpa was summoned for an audit,1824

He tells him that there's a forest a little out of the city, in the forest is a lake, and in the lake lives a magic frog.
