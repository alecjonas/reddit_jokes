tarts preparing for the party. The next day after work, the guests begin to arrive. The whole affair is an instant success. Everyone is laughing, drinking and eating and having a grand old time. 

Eventually, the man gets a little peckish and heads over to the table with the assorted barbecued meats and makes himself a hotdog. He adds all the trimmings - cheese, slaw, onions, even a little bacon, and to top it all off, he decides to crack open the mysterious and enigmatic bottle of ""vision enhancing ketchup"". 

He adds it to his hotdog, takes a bite, and is immediately disgusted by the putrid taste of the sauce. It's absolutely vile. The stench fills his nose and makes his eyes water, he is immediately overcome with nausea and dizziness and is helpless to resist the urge to spit the mouthful out onto the ground. As he coughs and splutters, his friends rush to make sure he's alright. 

""Don't worry everyone! Just some nasty ketchup, is all.""

 His friend asks 

""what on earth was wrong with that ketchup?""

 ""I don't know, it was some weird fancy stuff. It said it would make my vision better but all it did was make me nearly vomit! Such a waste of money. I definitely won't buy it again, I can tell you that much.""

&amp;#x200B;

His friend just smiles knowingly and says to him ""Ahhh... Well, Heinz-Sight is twenty twenty"".",The Mysterious Bottle of Ketchup,7

After hours of waiting, and still before sunrise, the Commissar came out, on schedule, to open the doors. 

""Comrades! I inform you that we cannot yet open the doors. These rumors are completely out of control. There will not be enough meat for 200 people. In such a situation, we must ask all Jews to leave. You will not receive meat today.""

Knowing that the Commissar could easily check their nationality on their passports, all of the Jews left the line. 

The sun never really rose that day, as the rest of the line continued to wait under the impermeable concrete massing of storm clouds. The wind blew all the more bitterly, and the previously excited whispers were slowly replaced by grumbling about the cold. Then! The Commissar reappeared.

""Comrades! I inform you that we cannot open these doors. The shipment has been delayed in Bryansk, where there is an acute need for meat rations for the Marxist-Leninist cause. The result follows: Only those of you who are Communist Party members may continue to wait.""

This cuts down the line significantly, as not one in ten of the people is a party member. Still, aside from a few reproachful glances, there were no comments from those departing the line, for the party was respected. 

The wind picks up and the snow drives ever harder, turning into frozen rain. Sleet piles up around their feet. Complaints about the weather die down, and the only sound from the dozen or so brave souls left standing, is the involuntary chattering of teeth. These determined citizens continue to wait. One, two, three more hours.

At long last! The Commissar reappears. But his face is laden with bad news. 

""Comrades! Believe me: I am as angry as you! There never was any shipment of meat! These rumors were part of an elaborate counter-revolutionary provocation!  I am sorry, you need all return home. No meat today.""

The remnants of the line were furious. Remarked one: ""Funny how things always seem to work out best for the Jews!""","Word spread quickly that a meat shipment was inbound from Moscow, in the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.",6

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,112

'You talk?' he asks.  

'Yep,' the Beagle replies..  

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says 'So, what's your story?'  

The Beagle looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA and they had me sworn into the toughest branch of the armed services...the US Army Special Forces. You know the reputation of them Green Berets.  

'In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders; because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running, but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. So, I decided to settle down.  

I retired from the Army (8 dog years is 56 Corps years) and signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.'

She thought they were gorgeous, unique, and so clever! Alas, the trouble with parrots, if you can believe this, is their cost - she couldn't believe how expensive they were!

This young woman went from store to store, from big chains to specialty boutiques, but she just couldn't seem to find a parrot within her family's budget. She determined to try one more store, before giving up.

Well, it just so happened that this last store, a small pet store on the edge of town, had a parrot on sale for twenty dollars. Twenty bucks! The woman couldn't believe it. She asks the man at the counter ""sir, I notice your parrot is incredibly cheap. It looks to be in good health (having become quite the expert in her search), why is it so cheap?""

The proprietor replied ""Ma'am, I'm going to level with you. This parrot's former owner also happened to be the owner of a bordello, and as such this parrot has picked up some pretty filthy language. I couldn't possibly sell it for full price.""

Hearing this, the woman quickly decided that there was simply no language foul enough to deter her from purchasing a parrot at such a steal. So, she pays the man, takes the parrot home, walks inside, sets the cage upon her table, and removes the blanket covering the cage. The parrot, adjusting to his new surroundings, sees the woman and squawks ""NEW MADAM, NEW MADAM!"" and the woman thinks, ""well, that's not such bad langauge after all.""

An hour later her daughters come home from school. The parrot sees them, and squawks ""NEW MADAM, NEW MADAM, NEW WHORES, NEW WHORES!"" At this, the woman's daughters become upset, as they can't understand why the parrot would say such cruel things, and the mother began to regret her purchase just a bit.

Not long after, the father returns home. The parrot takes one look at him and squawks ""NEW MADAM, NEW MADAM, NEW WHORES, NEW WHORES, SAME FACES, hey George!""",NSFW A woman wants to buy a pet,16

post,adghtx,2qh72,jokes,false,1546857228,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/adghtx/room_39/,self.jokes,," A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.  


\-The client: is room 39 empty?  
\-The boss: yes, sir.  
\-The client: can I book it?  
\-The boss: of course you can.  
\-The client: thank you.  


Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.  


The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.  


The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.  


Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.  


After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.  


The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.  


In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.  


He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.  


The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.  


The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.  


After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.  


The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.  


This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.  


Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.  


The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.  


The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.   


To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.  


The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.  


In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.  


\-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''  
\-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.  
\-''Swear''  
\-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''  
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.   


Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.",Room 39,36

Michael said, 'Just a minute I have to go pee.' 


The teacher responded by saying, 'That would be rude and impolite. 


What about you Sherman, how would you say it?' 


Sherman said, 'I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be 
right back.' 

'That's better, but it's still not very polite to say the word bathroom at the 
dinner table. 


And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us your

Peter thinks this is a great idea and quickly sets up an event on FB and invites all his friends. Peter is a well traveled fellow and has mates from all over the place, many of them accept and the party looks like it's going to be a great success.

The next week, Peter sees Paul again and Paul explains that he mentioned the party to his mother in law and she expressed great interest in coming to the party - it's been years since she has been back to Mexico and can't wait to feel right back at home. Peter hasn't met this woman before, but figures what the heck, she sounds like good fun, bring her along!

A few weeks go by and Peter has everything he needs for the party. He has several bottles of tequila, he has made a load of Mexican food for people to snack on and he even found an extra large pinata and filled it with authentic Mexican treats he found in the international aisle at his local supermarket.

The day of the party rolls around and people start showing up, many are wearing sombreros and ponchos etc, spirits are high and everything seems to be going well. Paul and his mother turn up and she seems thrilled and heads straight over to the table with all the food.

Moments later she returns and something is clearly wrong, she has gone from excited to sullen and Peter and Paul notice immediately.

""What's wrong?"" they ask. She explains that her mother always used to make massive pot of guacamole for parties back home and it was always a huge hit, she had really been looking forward to trying some of Peter's guacamole but realized there wasn't any.

Peter feels terrible about this, he wants everyone to have a great time and noticed his mate Patrick hasn't arrived yet and lives near the supermarket across town. He gives him a quick call, explains the situation and asked if Patrick can pick up as many pots of guacamole as he can from the supermarket and to bring them over.

Patrick, being the great guy that he is, agrees to do this and sets off to the supermarket. He happily discovers they have a sale on guacamole and buys the lot, he had to take 2 trips to the back of the shop to get it all up front to pay.

Back at the party, Peter is having a great time and getting a little tipsy. At this point he has had several tequila slammers and is well on his way to being drunks. All is well until he receives a phone call from Patrick.

""There is a problem, mate"" Patrick explains. ""I got the guacamole and got loads of it too"".

""Great!"" Peter tells him, ""that is perfect, get over here now!""

Patrick replies ""That's just the thing, I got all this guacamole and I can barely carry it. I feel like my arms are going to fall off and I have to walk all the way across town"".

Getting a little frustrated at this point, Peter tells him ""Just stick it in your trunk and you will be fine, you can pick your car up tomorrow""

Patrick replies ""That's just it mate, I would but I don't avacado"".",Peter is throwing a party for his 31st birthday...,2

One day, a blind man walks in and asks for the job. When the manager laughed, the blind man says ""I may be blind, but I'm the best lumberman you'll ever meet. I'll prove it to you. Bring me any piece of lumber on your site and by touch and smell alone, I can tell you anything there is to know about that wood.

Intrigued, the manager has a yard-hand bring ina plank and lays it out on the table in front of the blind man. He promptly begins to sniff the board and feel it all over. He says, ""That's a 2x6 by 10' plank of mid-struct Douglas Fir. It was taken from a forest in mid Washington and milled by Lonnie's Lumber in Spokane.""

The manager can't believe it. He brings in a sheet of panel wood and tries again. ""That's a four by eight Red Cedar plywood from Oregon, milled at Bend woodworks.""

Dumbfounded, the manager checks the millmark and sure enough, this blind guy is right again. He brings in several more finished products and the stranger is right every single time!

""Okay, okay"" he says, ""You've got the job. I just have one more board I want you to check out. Now don't feel on it, just do that smell thing, I wanna see if you are the real deal.""

""Sure thing"" the blind man says. The manager then tells the yardman to go get that new secretary and bring her in here. The manager backs her in front of the blind guy and has him do his thing.

The man sniffs her up and down and looks a little confused. He speaks up and says ""Turn it over so I can smell the other side.""

They turn her around and the blind man takes another sniff and says ""Oh I see, you guys are tryna pull a fast one on me. That's a shithouse door off a tuna boat!""",The blind lumberman (long),2

post,adbqqd,2qh72,jokes,false,1546820020,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/adbqqd/johnny_and_the_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"so theres this kid named johnny and he is excited for his 5th birthday, so his father mike comes up and asks him what he wants.

""hey son, you got a big day coming up. what would you like?""

""well dad,"" johnny says after a few moments thinking ""I would like to have 3 pink ping pong balls""

mike is taken back by this ""uh okay kid, what do you want them for?""

""dad, I just want these pink ping pong balls, trust me""

mike figures that its just a kid being a kid and goes for it.

""alright son you got it!"" mike says with a smile.

""thanks dad!"" johnny goes on his way and gets his 3 pink ping pong balls come his birthday.

time passes by and now johnny is 15 turning 16 and just as when he was younger his father comes up and asks him what he wants for his important 16th birthday.

""so johnny,"" mike says coyly ""you got a big birthday coming up, what are you wanting? maybe something with 4 wheels and an engine?""

johnny paused for a moment before speaking

""you know what I want dad, I want 72 pink ping pong balls""

mike was very confused, he was offering a brand new car to his son and he was asking for ping pong balls?

""uhm, why would you chose a handful of ping pong balls over a car?""

""dad please, I just want these ping pong balls, you gotta trust me.""

mike gave in and decided that the ping pong balls would be cheaper than a car.

""thanks dad, I love you"" johnny got his ping pong balls and went on his way

 a few more years pass and johnny has graduated highschool

""so son, what can I get as a grad gift from dad?"" mike's pride shone through like a lighthouse in the dark over his son's biggest accomplishment yet.

""hmm, well dad I would like 396 pink ping pong balls""

""ok son, what could you possibly want with that many ping pong balls?""

""dad please, you need to trust me!"" johnny's plea was enough for mike to stop asking questions

""ok son, I guess its still cheaper than a computer.""

""thanks dad!"" johnny said as he went on his way

johnny has now graduated college with a master's degree. it was a long and hard trial to pass every last exam with top marks.

""wow son I would never expect to be this proud of someone in my life, you are doing the family a great honor by working so damn hard"" mike said with a tear in his eye

""thanks dad"" johnny said with a smile

""what can I do for you son, like a gift or something maybe pay off some loans?"" mike was grinning ear to ear, knowing that he could easily pay off all johhny's loans in one fell swoop.

""well dad"" johnny said with a pause ""I would like to have 5,288 pink ping pong balls""

""wait what!?!?"" mike said, he was dumbfounded that his son would rather have ping pong balls than his entire college career paid off ""what in the hell could you be doing with that many ping pong balls?""

""dad please, just trust me on this"" johnny said with a persuasive confidence. figuring it couldn't cost more than a full college education.

""okay son sure"" mike shrugged

""thanks so much dad"" johnny said as he went to go to his commencement ceremony.

time passes by even further, johnny is now married and just had his first child. now a grand parent, mike goes to ask johnny if there is anything he can do for his new grandson.

""well my son"" mike's voice was older and filled with gravel ""what can I do to help your new family?""

""well dad"" johnny smiles proudly ""I think our family could use 81,629 pink ping pong balls""

mike's face instantly turned sour

""son, you need to plan for the future. you have a family you need to take care of. you cant be this reckless when it comes to watching over your family"" mike was nearly shouting but johnny was stalwart.

""dad, please, just trust me"" johnny smiled. their conflict went back and forth for hours when mike finally gave in.

""okay son, whatever."" mike said with a defeatist tone.

""thanks dad"" johnny said with a smile

time passes by even further, johnny has grown deathly ill and lays in a hospital bed. mike comes over to talk to his son.

""oh god, why has this happened to you johnny?"" mike said with tears in his eyes. 

""d...dad"" johnny could barely speak ""I nee...need som...thing fro...m you...""

""yes son what is it"" mike was on the edge of his seat. ""what do you need?""

""da...d...I...n...eed...1 mill...ion 7 hundre...d 68...thous...and 4...hun...dred 22... pink...ping...pong...balls...""

""s...son why would you need those for?""

""tr...us....t...me...dad...""

mike was shaken and didn't know what to say

""okay son i'll do it, but I need you to promise that you will tell me what you use them for""

""o...ok...ay...dad"" johhny said as he fell asleep

mike took out a second mortgage on his house, withdrew all his savings and his 401k just to try and afford the ping pong balls. he then did all he could to get the tons of ping pong balls shipped out to the hospital and into the room with johnny. as he rushes through the doors and runs up to johnny to find out what he was doing with all those pink ping pong balls over the years.

Some would walk through the halls with their family with tears in their eyes. She hated every time that she had to give bad news to a family and their loved one. It tore her up.

So she hatched a plan to bring some encouragement to their lives. Most people had to walk past her office on their way to the main elevators on her floor. She stood in front of her door and decided to make a positive difference. So she walked to her desk, pulled out a colorful pack of Post-It sticky notes, and began writing.

Soon, encouraging notes of ""one day at a time"" and ""focus on the good"" and ""you are not alone' filled the exterior of her door. A colorful array of paper covered every inch of it, with the exception of a bright sign that read: ""take what you need."" One by one, patients and their families took the notes that most encouraged them. As the notes were taken, she would think of new notes to write and stick them on her door.

Months later, the doctor took a week off for the holidays. When she returned, her door was totally empty. All of her sticky notes were gone! While she was glad that so many people had been encouraged by her notes, she knew she had a lot of work to do to replace them and fill the door again.

That night, she stayed up for hours writing brand-new notes. But when she got in the next morning, her door was already full of more sticky notes! Who could have possibly done all this work for her? She looked around, and spotted a dark figure around the corner. Curious, the doctor walked toward the mysterious figure. As she got closer, it disappeared behind the wall.

She ran after what she was sure was her good samaritan, only to find them in a dead sprint toward the elevators. They opened, and she ran as fast as she could, barely making it before the door could close. In the corner, still carrying a handful of sticky notes, was a Buddist monk. With both of them out of breath, she could only stammer out ""W-what? Why?""

Breathing hard, the monk turned to face her and said ""You didn't know yet? I thought everyone knew that reposting is the best way to get karma.""",A doctor at the cancer center had a great idea.,4

As a result, math jokes have an elemental role in the history of the internet.

From the earliest Usenet threads to the techiest subreddits, geeky math jokes — some implicit swipes at less-pure disciplines, other puns or plays on words of different concepts — have been a major part of the modern history of math.

Here are just a few of the best ones. Where necessary, we'll do the unthinkable and the tacky and explain the joke.","Back when the internet was young, the primary users were its builders, math and tech-oriented academics spread around the country.",0

""Some faggot stole our cow."" he tells his sons.

One  of the sons says: ""If it's a faggot, then he's of short stature, if  he's of short stature then he's from Govnyukino, the village next door,  if he's from Govnyukino, then it's Vasya the Tractor Driver. So the sons  go to Govnyukino, the village next door, find Vasya the Tractor Driver  and beat him half to death. They demand that he give the cow back.

""I  don't have your fucking cow!"" yells Vasya in protest. So the father and  his sons drag Vasya to the village judge. They tell the judge, ""This  faggot stole our cow.""

""Prove it"" says the judge.

""Well,  there's nothing to prove really."" says the son, ""If he's a faggot, then  he's of short stature. If he's of short stature, then he's from  Govnyukino, the village next door. If he's from Govnyukino, then it must  be Vasya the Tractor Driver.""

""To hell  with your proof. That ain't proof at all"" So they argued back and forth.  Finally, the judge pulls out a box and says: ""Tell you what. If you can  correctly guess what's in this box, then I'll believe your reasoning""

One  of the sons says, ""Well, the box is square, that means there's  something round inside. If it's something round, then it's orange. If  it's orange, then it's an orange""

The judge then opens the box, and lo behold it's an orange.

""Vasya, stop being a faggot and give the cow back"" says the judge.

The sailor didn't want to die so he chose homohomo. The Chief then said, "" Great choice."" So the rest of the cannibals took him behind the tree and had their way with him. After they were done they gave him a little rowboat and some food. They then sent him on his way.  
The second sailor was led out and he was asked the same question, ""Homohomo or death""
Now that he knew what homohomo was the second sailor had a tough choice but ultimately choose homohomo, also because he did not want to die.
""Another great choice"" the Chief stated. The second sailor was then taken behind the same tree and ravaged. After everyone was done they also gave him a rowboat and some supplies and let him go.
The third and final sailor was brought before the Chief. This sailor however was the toughest sailor on the ship, he never lost fights and was one of the toughest men around. He told the Chief, ""I'm not afraid to die. I choose death!""

After the other two ask how she knows, she explains that her child was conceived with her on top. 

At this, the brunette exclaims “Well, I’m going to have a little girl! When we conceived her, I was on bottom.” 

After a few moments of silence, the blonde breaks out in uncontrollable tears and begins to sob rather loudly.

There was a boy who didn’t know curse words and it was thanksgiving day. He comes out of his room and sits down with his sister. She is watching a reality show, the actress on the show calls out the actor “you dick” the little boy never hearing that word before asks his sister what does that mean? She frantically starts looking for an explanation and sees a coat rack and says “well dick is just another word for coat”. He nods not knowing any different and continues to watch the show. Not wanting to have to deal with him any longer the sister tells him to go play outside with their brother. The little boy obliged and grabs his jacket and goes outside where his older brother and his friends are playing football in the front yard. As he gets to the lawn one of the kids falls down and scrapes his knee and starts tearing up. One of the other boys yells out “get up you pussy”! Not knowing what pussy means the little boy asks his brother. His brother frantically looks for an explanation and sees his little sibling wearing a jacket. “Well, it is just another word for jacket” the older brother explains. “ how about you go back inside and ask dad for a bandage?” The little boy once again follows orders and goes back inside looking for his dad. He hears his dad in the restroom and walks to the restroom. While he gets to the door he sees his dad shaving. He asks his dad about the bandages and as the father turns he accidentally nicks himself shaving and yells out “shit!”. The boy puzzled by the wording his dad just used asked him what does shit mean? “Well shit is nothing more than another word for shaving cream that’s all”. The boy looking puzzled as he has never heard it before starts to ask his dad another question but his dad interjects and tells his son to go check if his mom needs any help in the kitchen. The little boy heads to the kitchen where his mom is pulling the turkey out of the oven. She grabs the turkey and burns the back side of her hand on the stove and yells out “fuck”. The boy hears this while walking in and asks what does fuck mean? His mom just says “it’s another term for stuffing the turkey!” As she finishes the door bell rings and the little boy is told to go let the visitors in. He walks up to the door and opens it and greets the guests “hi everyone thanks for coming! Go ahead and hang your dicks and pussies over there, my mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey and my dad is in the bathroom putting shit on his face!” ",This literally the first joke with curse words that I remember knowing.,40

The family's 8 year old daughter was utterly fascinated by the daily activities of the builders and sat on the fence after school each day and all day weekends, watching.

Amused by her presence the builders would smile and give her small tasks to 'help'. Carrying a bucket between builders, turning on the hose, passing messages and so forth. They would let her sit with them while eating lunch and the girl essentially became their mascot, with her own tiny hard hat and gloves as well.

At the end of the second week of construction, the foreman gave the girl a little yellow pay envelope, containing five dollars. The girl excitedly took it home to her parents.

Her Mom was impressed and saw an opportunity to teach the girl about work, money and saving, so took her and the five dollars to the bank.

The bank teller was greatly amused when the Mother explained how the girl had earned the money and was looking to earn interest on it.

She turned to the girl and said ""You worked very hard to earn this. Well done! Let me open an account right away.""

The girl was beaming as she handed over the money.

The bank teller handed her a deposit slip and asked ""Do you think you'll be returning to the work site next week sweetheart?""

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts off 1 week before Thanksgiving. A little boy is playing with some toys on his front porch. All of the sudden some teenagers show up and start dicking around on the lawn. The boy's mother comes out of the house and yells ""Get off my lawn you Bitches and Bastards!"" not realizing her son was sitting right there. All the teenagers scatter. The little boy then asked his mom ""mommy mommy what does bitches and bastards mean?"" The mom responded ""Umm ... boys and girls.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to that night. The little boy is having trouble sleeping and goes over to his parent's room to get them to help him. He opens their door and walks over to the bed but does not see either of them there. All of the sudden he starts hearing some sounds from the closet. The boy walked over and opened the door. He ended up seeing his parents having sex and moaning ""mmm dicks and vaginas."" The parents realized their kid was standing watching them, and quickly covered themselves up with the first clothing items they could find. The little boy then asked ""Daddy daddy what does dicks and vaginas mean?"" The dad replied ""Umm ... coats and hats.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, thanksgiving day arrives. Both the boy's parents are trying to get nervous as both of their parents are coming over for dinner. The little boy goes upstairs to find his dad shaving in the washroom. The dad then exclaimed loudly ""SHIT!"" because he cut himself by accident. The little boy, being himself asked ""daddy daddy what does shit mean?"" The dad, thinking quick on his feet said ""Shaving.""

&amp;#x200B;

The little boy then went downstairs to try and help his mom in the kitchen. He walks in and sees her carving a turkey. All of the sudden the mom yelled ""FUCK!"" as she cut herself as well. The little boy said ""mommy mommy what does fuck mean?"" The mother, used to her son's questions responded ""cutting.""

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the doorbell rings. The mom, busy in the kitchen told her son to go get the door. The boy opened the door. It was his grandparents. He immediately said ""Hello bitches and bastards may I please take your dicks and vaginas?"" His grandma said ""Young man, where are your parents!"" The little boy then responded ""well my dad is upstairs shitting himself and my mom's busy in the kitchen fucking the turkey.""",The Thanksgiving Story,8

Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said “Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed.  I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”

His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We’ve tried everything.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.”  The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”

Terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him.

FASTER… FASTER…

He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him. However, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping...

Clappity-BUMP… Clappity-BUMP… Clappity-BUMP…

…on his heels, the terrified man runs.

Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.

With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door.

Bumping and clapping toward him.

The man screams and reaches for something, anything, but all he can find is a bottle of cough syrup!

Desperate, he throws the cough syrup at the casket…

and then, 

The coffin stops.

Looking down at the remains of his best pal, Paddy shakes his head and says, 'Fook dat. 
Dis budgie jumping is too fook'n dangerous for me!'

THERE'S MORE. ...

Moment's later; Seamus arrives up at ConnorPass. 
He's been to the pet shop too and walks up to the edge of the cliff carrying another cardboard box in one hand and a shotgun in the other.. 
'Hi, Paddy, watch dis,' Seamus says. 
He takes a parrot from the box and lets him fly free. 
He then throws himself over the edge of the cliff with the gun. 
Paddy watches as half way down, Seamus takes the gun and shoots the parrot. 
Seamus continues to plummet down and down until he hits the bottom and breaks every bone 
in his body. 
Paddy shakes his head and says, 'And I'm never trying dat parrotshooting either!'

IT IS NOT OVER YET....

Paddy is just getting over the shock of losing two friends when Sean appears. 
He's also been to the pet shop and is carrying a cardboard box out of which he pulls a chicken. 
Sean then takes the chicken by its legs and hurls himself off the cliff and disappears down and down until he hits a rock and breaks his spine. 
Once more Paddy shakes his head. 
'Fook dat, lads. First dere was Gerry with his budgie jumping, den Seamus parrotshooting.... And now Sean and his fook'n hengliding!'

As age got the better of the king, he decided to crown the Prince and move on to a peaceful life of wine and women.

But before he could hand over the throne,the King had only one request of his son. He asked the Prince, ""Tapir, do you know what a Ripo is?""

The Prince answered ""Yes, my beloved king. It is a wild bee like insect found in the remote forests of the land. They say it carries enough venom to kill an elephant.""

To which the king said "" You are right Prince. Now if you want to take your place in this throne and rule this land as your, bring back a Ripo, alive and unharmed.""

The Prince was taken aback at this strange request. But ""Old age gives wisdom and maybe the King will see this as a test of my valor"" thought the price and said ""As you wish my King. With your blessings and our army stuff my side, nothing is impossible.""

The king, upon hearing this, erupted into thunderous laughter that shook the court. Then, he said ""My dear Prince, this task is set down for you and only you. Any man who accompanies you will have a claim over the throne, if he wills.""

At this point the Prince realised that his father is going insane but for the dignity of the throne he replied ""As you wish my King"". The price then set out to capture a Ripo alive.

The journey through the forest is filled with tales of cunning, bravery and luck as he faces beasts, monsters and sly men. After three weeks of sleepless nights and tiring days, the Prince came upon a nest of the wild insect. Each one the size of a cherry, they could not easily caught. Agitate just one, the entire hive will attack you.

So the Prince built a cage out of twigs and vines and places it among the bushes with a fruit as a bait. He waited three days and three nights before a curious one decided to visit the cage. As soon as it landed, the Prince closed the cage's door and smiled at the insect.

He was halfway through the task and the Prince was spurred by this. He rode non stop all the way back to the palace and made it back by the night fall on third day of the second week.

He is informed by the guards that the King will see him on the next day. The Prince stormed into the king's chamber carrying the cage with him, still weary from the journey and shouts ""Oh king, I have brought what you willed for. Why do you make me wait now.""

The king then took the cage from him and placed it down. He replied ""Time favours those who wait"" and dismissed him. Angry at the treatment but powerless, the Prince went back to his quarter and retired for the day.

The next day, the Prince is crowned as the new king by the prime minister in the absence of the king. When the Prince questiones his absence, the prime minister informed him that the King is indisposed.

The Prince, now satisfied with the crowning but confused by his father's absence, visited the Royal Quarters. There he saw his father, with the insect in his hands, posing for a strike and drew out his sword. But the king replies, ""Rule well my son. My end is here. You may wonder why I asked you to bring this vile bee here and I will give you the answer now"".

"" The saying is true and this insect's venom can kill an elephant. But it is a secret that a death by this insect will take me to heaven. Learn today that Ripo's Sting gives you karma and be at peace"".","In the mythical kingdoms of ancient India, lived the king Ramuk.",16

But Dave had a secret that he was terrified of. You see, Dave recently entered into an intimate relationship with one of his patients which is a big No-No in the medical field. Dave started freaking out thinking about what would happen if the news got a hold of this story. He would pace back and forth in his office for hours when he didn't have any patients to deal with. 

But in this trying time, Dave heard a reassuring voice in the back of his head speaking out to him and easing his worries. The voice would say "" Dave, you have nothing to be afraid of. You are a smart, kind, caring, good looking, rich doctor. You've been working all your life for helping others so I don't see why it's so bad for you to be happy in this situation. If the news wants to make a big deal of it, so what? Big deal. Who cares?"" 

And Dave would think himself yeah!  You know what? Maybe I do deserve this. And Dave would feel better about his predicament and care less about what others would think and he would be able to get through a few days without worry. 

But then another voice, malicious and degrading, would speak to Dave.

""Daaave..."" the voice sputtered, dripping with hatred and disgust. 

""What do you think you're doing? You can't enter into a relationship with one of your patients!""

Dave tried to shrug the voice off as he went about his routine, but the voice still echoed through the back of his mind.

I didn't think anything of it and was about to shoot when the frog says ""Ribbit. 9- Iron"". 

I looked around and didn't see anyone. 

""Ribbit. 9-Iron."" 

I looked at the frog and it just stared back at me. So I put my other club away, and grabbed a 9-iron. Boom! I hit it 10 inches from the cup. I was shocked! 

So I said to the frog, ""Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?"" 

The frog replies ""Ribbit. Lucky frog."" 

I decided to take the frog with me to the next hole. 

""What do you think frog?"" I asked. 

""Ribbit. 3-wood,"" the frog replied. 

I took out my 3-wood, and boom! A hole in one.

It was incredible. By the end of the day, I had golfed the best game of golf in my life. So I asked the frog, ""OK where to next?"" 

The frog replied, ""Ribbit. Las Vegas."" 

We went to Las Vegas, went to Caesar's Palace and the frog said, ""Ribbit. Roulette."" 

When I got to the roulette table, the frog said, ""Ribbit. $3000, black 6."" 

Now, this was a million-to-one shot to win, but by this point I trusted the frog completely. I put it all on black 6 and, amazingly, won! Tons of cash come sliding back across the table. 

Suddenly I was a high roller. They put me up in the best room in the hotel. I looked at the frog down and said, ""Frog, you've won me all this money and I am forever grateful. I don't know how to repay you!"" 

The frog replies, ""Ribbit, Kiss Me."" 

So I thought, ""Why not? After all the frog did for me, it is a small price to pay."" With the kiss, however, the frog turned into a gorgeous 17 year-old girl. 

""And that, your honour, is how the girl ended up in my room.""",I took the day off work and decided to go out golfing.,1636

While hiking through the thick forest they were ambushed at spear-point by a tribe of large aboriginal men. The tribesmen tied their hands behind their backs and marched them through the forest to a small village, busy with working men, and gorgeous topless women who all stopped to marvel at the strangers.

The men were led to the center of the village in front of a large heavily guarded hut. They were lined up side by side and forced to their knees with a tribesman standing behind each man, a spear tip put the the back of their necks waiting to penetrate and kill each man. One of the war party tribesmen walked to the door of the large hut and spoke loudly towards the entrance, and then backed away.

Appearing through the door was a very large man, riding on a throne carried by ten of the most beautiful topless women the explorers had ever seen. 

The first man spoke, “The women are gorgeous!”

“....and that must be their leader”, said the second man.

The chief yelled, “Quiet strangers!” As the women placed the throne in front of the men. 

The chief pointed at the first man, “you have trespassed sacred lands, stranger. You must choose: Death or Bunga Bunga”

“Wait, what?” The first man spoke. “We come in peace and....”

“SILENCE!” The chief yelled. “Choose... death or Bunga Bunga!”

The first man looked at the other two and said “I’m too young to die. I have my whole life ahead of me, and look at these women. Maybe Bunga Bunga isn’t so bad...” and turned to the chief and said “I choose Bunga Bunga.”

The chief smiled and clapped his hands together very loudly twice and bellowed “BUNGA BUNGA”

Just then two of the biggest tribesman came through the crowd that had gathered.
Big and muscular, these two were huge and mean looking. They snatched up the first man, tore all his clothes from him, bent him over, and forced him into the roughest anal sex anyone had ever seen.

The other two explorers stared in horror as the chief laughed. When the two tribesman were finished, they threw the man down, and tossed him his tattered clothes. 

The chief said “you may go now, to never return, or death will be certain!” The first explorer grabbed his clothes and ran off screaming into the forest.

The chief pointed at the second explorer... “you have trespassed sacred lands. You must choose... Death or Bunga Bunga”

The second explorer look at the third and said, “I’m to young to die. I have a wife and two children. I want to see them grow up and marry. I want to be a grandfather. My god... I have to chose the other.” Eyes wide open he turned back to the chief and said “I chose Bunga Bunga.”

The chief smiled and clapped his hands together very loudly twice and bellowed “BUNGA BUNGA”

The two tribesman grabbed explorer two and repeated the rough anal sex. When they were done, the chief bellowed, “you may go now, to never return, or death will be certain!” The explorer grabbed his clothes and ran off screaming into the forest just like the first.

The chief, smiling, pointed at explorer three... “you have trespassed sacred lands. You must choose.... Death or Bunga Bunga”

The third explorer smiled back at the chief and said, “you know what chief? I am an older man. I have lived a long, good life. My wife has passed away, my kids are grown...”

The third explorer then rose to his feet and said, “I don’t fear death as the other two did.” A smug look came across his face and he smirked at the chief, “There is no way in hell that two giant men are going to have their way with me like that. I choose DEATH!”

The chief slowly smiled and said...”I admire your courage. You would make a good warrior....” he then stood, raised his hands, clapped loudly three times, and bellowed...

“DEATH... by Bunga Bunga”

The man sitting at the bar hears a voice call out to him.

“Hey there, I like your shoes.”

Not seeing anyone nearby, the perplexed man asks the bartender;

“Excuse me, did you say something?”

The bartender replies that he did not, and continues polishing glasses.

A little confused, the man shrugs his shoulders and continues with his drink.

The mystery voice appears again.

“Hey there buddy, I love your shirt!”

The man asks the bartender again if he heard anything, to which the bartender repeats that he did not.

Now very confused, the man continues his drink but it’s not long before the man again hears the voice say:

“You look really great today my good friend - have you been working out?”

Thinking he’s losing his mind, the man explains to the bartender desperately

“I’m sitting here all by myself and I keep hearing voices. First they say they like my shoes, then they say they love my shirt, and now they ask me if I’ve been working out. Please tell me what the hell is going on!!?”

“Ohhh..” says the bartender knowingly, as he explains.

Then one day they had a chance to meet up, as the old folks were going out on a day trip.

The two complained of some sort of illness and the carers told them to say put.

When the coach with the elders in had pulled away the couple made sure the coast was clear before slipping into the man's bedroom.

As soon as they'd taken their clothes off and got into bed the man asked the women did she like anything doing to her?

""I love to be licked down below!"" came the reply.

So the man ventured downwards.

After five minutes the man came back up.

""Anything wrong?"" asked the women.

""Well yes there's a horrible smell and it tastes quite bad down there,"" said the man.

""Oh,"" said the women. ""That must be my arthritis""

""In your vagina?"" enquired the man.

""No"" answered the women. ""The arthritis is in my shoulder. I can't wipe my arse."" ",An elderly couple,6

proceeded to have the time of his life, that is, until the ship sank.  

He soon finds himself on an island with no other 
people, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts.  

After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.  

 In disbelief, he asks, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?""  

 She replies, ""I rowed over from the other side of the island where I landed when my fishing boat sank.""  ""Amazing,"" he notes.  ""You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you.""  

 ""Oh, this ole thing?"" explains the woman. "" I made the boat out of some raw material I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm tree branches, and the sides and stern came from an Eucalyptus tree.""  

 ""But, where did you get the tools?""  

 ""Oh, that was no problem,"" replied the 
woman. "" On the south side of the island, a very 
unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in a volcanic vent I found just down island, it melted into ductile iron and I used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware.""  

 The guy is stunned.  

""Let's row over to my place,"" she says ""and I'll give you a tour."" So, after a short time of rowing, she soon docks the boat at a small hand built wharf. As the man looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat.  Before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house.  

While the woman ties up the rowboat with an 
expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, It's not much, but I call it home. 

Please sit down.""  ""Would you like a drink?""  

 ""No! No thank you,"" the man blurts out, still dazed. ""I can't take another drop of coconut juice.""  

 ""Oh, it's not coconut juice,"" winks the woman. ""I have a still. How would you like a Jack Daniels neat?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. After they exchange their individual survival stories, the woman announces,  ""I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs.""  

No longer questioning anything, the man goes 
upstairs into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.  

""This woman is amazing,"" he muses. ""What's next?""  

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but a bandana around her blonde locks and some small flowers on tiny vines, each strategically positioned. She smelled faintly of coconut oil. She then beckons for him to sit down next to her.  

""Tell me,"" she begins suggestively, slithering 
closer to him, ""We've both been out here for many 
months. You must have been lonely. When was the last time you had a really good ride?"" 

She stares into his eyes.  
He can't believe what he's hearing.

""You mean..."" he swallows excitedly as tears start to form in his eyes,

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"" The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. 

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy,"" the third guy replied."" He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""",A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives.,32592

post,acrlj4,2qh72,jokes,false,1546669547,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/acrlj4/the_penguin_expedition_nsfw/,self.jokes,,"In the middle of a North Pole expedition, the zoologist found a group of highly specialised penguins. Overwhelmed with excitements, he docked the ship and went to investigate.

Being the first time they saw humans, they were not afraid at all. In fact, the Penguins began to speak English. LITERALLY English. Some were playing soccer, the others were watching TVs. The zoologist were in awe. It’s the first time he found animals that exhibit human behaviours...

So he approached and interviewed one of the penguins.

“Hi! Um...what do you do usually??” The zoologists asked. That’s the only question he could think of.

“Well. I usually read books, play some basketball, sometimes hanging out with friends. When I am really bored, I might watch some porn...”

“....Ah ! And yes. I Love beating diddo!”

The zoologist were puzzled. What is “beating diddo?”
He wondered if this is an individual behaviour. So he went and asked another penguin.

“Well, I like swimming. Work out every day. Some casual sex once in a while. Love playboy spreads!  Ah, and I spare sometime to beat diddo” 

The other penguin added, “ Yeah. We love hanging out. Sometimes we beat diddo together.”

The zoologist were so confused. It seemed that they have quite an erotic lifestyle, but what the hell was “beating diddo”?

So he approached another penguin from afar. It looked a little nerdy. It even had a pair of glass. 

“Hey fella, what do you usually do?” The zoologist asked.

“Me?” The penguin asked, “ I like to read, fictions or non-fictions. Solving calculus. Watch some Anime. Sometimes I cook. Just baked some muffins”

“...Is that it? Nothing else?” The zoologist asked.

“No, nothing else.” The penguin replied

“Don’t you ‘beat diddo’ like the rest of the folks?” 
The zoologist questioned.

“Ah! Well ...
..
I...
I...
I...
...I am Diddo”
