So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

So this duck hunter finally talked his wife into going hunting with him. They were to leave very early the next day, so they prepared everything the night before. The alarm clock was set for 3am, and hubby was gonna get up first and make sure everything was ready.

He got up to check on stuff, and the weather had turned bad: it was 30°, raining, and wind was blowing 25mph. He went to check on the dog.

He got back and woke his wife. When she saw the weather, she said, “I didn’t sign up for this. No way I’m going out in this weather.”

He said, “Well, if you don’t want to go, you either have to let me fuck you in the butt or give me a blow-job.”

She decided that a blow-job would be faster and more comfortable, so she got to it.

She suddenly looked up and said, “Your dick smells like shit!”

He said, “Yeah, the dog didn’t want to go either.”",The Duck Hunter,12

**Sarah and her thirteen-year-old sister had been fighting a lot this year. This happens when you combine a headstrong two-year-old, who is sure she is always right, with a young adolescent.**

**Sarah's parents, trying to take advantage of her newfound interest in Santa Claus, reminded the two-year-old that Santa was watching and doesn't like it when children fight. This had little impact.**

**""I'll just have to tell Santa about your misbehavior,"" the dad said as he picked up the phone and dialed. Sarah's eyes grew big as her dad asked ""Mrs. Claus"" (really Sarah's aunt; Santa's real line was busy) if she could put Santa on the line. Sarah's mouth dropped open as Dad described to Santa (Sarah's uncle) how the two-year-old was acting. But, when Dad said that Santa wanted to talk to her, she reluctantly took the phone.**

**Santa, in a deepened voice, explained to her how there would be no presents Christmas morning to children who fought with their sisters. He would be watching, and he expected things to be better from now on.**

**Sarah, now even more wide eyed, solemnly nodded to each of Santa's remarks and silently hung the phone up when he was done. After a long moment, Dad (holding in his chuckles at being so clever) asked, ""What did Santa say to you, dear?""**

**In almost a whisper, Sarah sadly but matter-of-factly stated, ""Santa said he won't be bringing toys to my sister this year.""**",Better be Good,10

It was a week before Christmas night that Dolf strode into a small inn, owned by an old ex-centurion and his family. He demanded an ale, and when the barkeeper querulously asked for payment of three copper pieces, Dolf glowered at him and said: ""Do you see my wolfskin armour, old man? Do you see the blood spatters on the fur? Do you not know who I am,"" and glancing at the old Roman armour and sword handing above the fireplace, spat out, ""you filthy old centurion?""

The barkeeper's wife, who'd been listening with one ear, looked over at Dolf and said, ""You, braggart, are rude, filthy and German. And your 'blood spatters' are just dark patches where the rain has soaked in.""

""IT'S NOT RAIN, IT'S BLOOD, YOU ROMAN WITCH!"" screamed Dolf, pulling out his sword. He then proceeded to slaughter everyone in the inn, the surrounding villages, and nearby farms. He climbed trees to stab the birds, set cruel traps to maul the animals, and spent three days sifting through the dirt around the inn to find all the insects burrowed there, and squash them with his mighty knuckle.

Finally, when his spate of death was complete, it was Christmas night. He walked over to the now flayed innkeepers wife, who was trussed above the fire. Sticking his bloody face into hers, he said, ""Rude Dolf the Red *knows* rain, dear.""","In ancient times, an mighty warrior of the Germanic tribes cut a swathe through the Roman Legions.",13

Actually it was a lesser know man, Cardinal Herzenbacher.
 He'd been a man of God from an early age, a pacifist all his life. When WWII broke out, he was conscripted and forced to fight, and so became a bomber pilot.
 A few months into the war he was shot down but survived, miraculously only losing an eye in the crash. 
  He continued his work with the church after leaving the war and started his mission work. Wanting to help the least fortunate he made his way to Africa and eventually found his way to Zimbabwe. While there he was called to duty when a diamond mine had a cave in. After making a very dangerous journey into the mine he began giving the gravely injured their last rights. Suddenly a second cave in occurred, trapping the Cardinal. Through the grace of God he survived, though he had barely escaped with his life, losing his left arm. 
  Decades later and a new Pope was to be elected. Many in the college of Cardinals believed he was the perfect man for the position. But sadly, many more believed that the parishioners just couldn't get behind a one eyed one armed flying papal people leader.",Did you know Francis was not the first choice to become the new Pope?,6

As she opens the door, the man is shocked to see the cat walk over and greet her. It growls and gives the man a dirty look and he thinks to himself “what the fuck?”

A couple days later, while his girlfriend is at work, the dude puts the cat in his car and drives two hours to the state line. He tossed the cat out and drives home.  By the time he gets home, his girlfriend is already home from work and is sitting on the couch watching TV. The cat is sitting on her lap! It hisses and gives the man a dirty look.

A few days later while his girlfriend is at work, he puts the cat in his car and drives for 4 hours before getting off the highway.

One day, he decided to leave work at lunchtime to try and catch her in the act. When he arrives at his  apartment he yells out “honey! Are you here? I thought we could have lunch together!” Sure enough, the wife was at the apartment and in the middle of having sex with her lover. She tells her lover that he has to hide quickly and so he does. The husband walks into the bedroom moments later to find his wife naked in bed. He exclaims “god dammit! I knew it! I knew you were cheating on me! Where is he? Where is this son of a bitch?” The wife cries and is adamant that she is not cheating on her husband, but the husband doesn’t believe her and begins tearing the apartment apart, trying to find the son of a bitch sleeping with his wife. 

Eventually, the husband has wrecked the apartment. He’s looked everywhere, in every closet, under every bed. There’s no one there. He was so sure, but his wife keeps telling him over and over that he’s crazy and that she’s not having an affair. Finally, the man starts to cool off and decides to go onto the balcony for a smoke. As he’s lighting up his cigarette, he sees two sets of fingers hanging onto the edge of his balcony. He looks over the railing and sees a man hanging to the side of his balcony. He yells “god dammit it! I knew it! You son of a bitch! You’re sleeping with my wife!” The man yells, begging the husband to help him and save his life. The man says he doesn’t know his wife and that he’s not sleeping with her. The husband doesn’t believe him and starts stomping on the man’s fingers, trying to get the man to let go and fall to his death. After several unsuccessful tries, the husband is so frustrated. He goes back into the apartment and unplugs his refrigerator and in a hot rage pushes it over the edge of the edge of balcony, ultimately pushing the man and himself to their deaths. 

Earlier that day in Heaven, God came up to the angel guarding the gates of Heaven and explained “so we are a bit backed up today. Don’t let anyone into Heaven unless they’ve had a really, really bad day. Got it?” The angel agrees and proceeds to ask all newcomers about how they ended up in Heaven. Eventually, the husband is greeted by the angel and the angel explains “Heaven is very backed up today, we are only allowing those in who have had a really bad day. So, how did you get here?”

The husband says “I suspected my wife of cheating on me so I came home to find her naked. Initially, I could find no man in my apartment, but eventually I found the son of a bitch hanging to the side of my balcony! While trying to push him off I accidently killed myself.” 

The angel feels bad for the husband and allows him to enter Heaven. Next, another man approaches the angel and the angel tells him to explain how he got to Heaven.

“Well” says the man, “I was doing yoga on my balcony, and I live on the 10th story of an apartment building, you know, when all of a sudden I stretched too much and accidently fell over the balcony! Luckily, though, I was able to grab hold of the balcony below mine, but then this maniac appeared, accusing me of sleeping with his wife and threw me off the balcony with a refrigerator! He killed us both!”

The angel, a bit skeptical, allows the second man into Heaven. Afterwards, he is greeted by a third man. The angel tells the man to tell him how he got into heaven.

The man replies, “I don’t know, man. I was sleeping with some dude’s wife and he came home so I hid in the refrigerator and then I died.”","A man suspected his wife of cheating on him. (A long one, but a good one)",19

The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon, when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy,*

*and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting - So I accepted.""*

Here are the scorecards from the event:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 2 - ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burnout taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 5 - LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very Impressive!

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage; Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb!

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge Number 3, He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 8 - Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Frank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?

They undress and step into the showers before they realise there is no soap.

Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress.

He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, and heads back to the showers.

He is halfway down the hall when he sees three nuns heading his way.

Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue.

The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.

Startled, he drops a bar of soap.

""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""its a soap dispenser"".

To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood... sure enough he drops the second bar of Soap.

The third nun decides to have a go.

She pulls once, then twice and three times but nothing happens.

So she gives several more tugs, then yells!

post,ee0tf0,2qh72,jokes,false,1576991062,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ee0tf0/the_girlfriend_of_nightmares/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.
Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?""
And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.
So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""
""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""
So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""
So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""
So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.
A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""
So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.
So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.
So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.""
I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow
So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.""
""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""
""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""
""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""
""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""
""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""
I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.
So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.
Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.
Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.
And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",The Girlfriend of Nightmares,10

Lady  luck had smiled in her favor, as Jane had a gained substantial lead  over her opponents. She even managed to win the game but, unfortunately,  time had run out before the show's host could ask her the big question.  Needless to say, Jane agreed to return the following day. Jane was  nervous and fidgety as her husband drove them home. ""I've just gotta win  tomorrow. I wish I knew what the answers are. You know I'm not going to  sleep at all tonight. I will probably look like garbage tomorrow.""  


""Relax,  honey,"" her husband, Roger, reassured her. ""It will all be OK."" Ten  minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys and started  heading out the door. ""Where are you going?"" Jane asked. ""I have a  little errand to run. I should be back soon"" he replied. Jane waited  impatiently for Roger's return. After an agonizing 3 hour absence, Roger  returned, sporting a very wide and wicked grin. ""Honey, I managed to  get tomorrow's question and answer!""  


""What is it?"" she cried excitedly.  


""OK.  The question is: 'What are the three main parts of the male anatomy?'  And the answer is 'The head, the heart, and the penis.' "" Shortly after  that, the couple went to sleep with Jane, now feeling confident and at  ease, plummeting into a deep and restful slumber. At 3:30 in the  morning, however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was asking her the  quiz show question. ""The head, the heart, and the penis,"" Jane replied  groggily before returning to sleep. And Roger asked her again in the  morning, this time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again, Jane  replied correctly.  


So it was that Jane was once again on the set  of the quiz show. Even though she knew the question and answer, she  could feel the butterflies conquering her stomach and nervousness  running through her veins. The cameras began running and the host, after  reminding the audience of the previous days events, faced Jane and  asked the big question.  


""Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy? You have 10 seconds.""  


""Hmm, uhm, the head?"" she said nervously. ""Very good. Six seconds.""  


""Eh, uh, the heart?"" ""Very good! Four seconds.""  


""I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning...""

 It's been nearly three weeks since he's eaten anything besides what he could 

forage and he's been reduced to sleeping in caves and under trees.

One afternoon he comes upon an old mansion in the woods. It has vines 

covering most of it and the man can't see any other buildings in the 

area. However, he sees smoke coming out of the chimney implying someone 

is home.

He knocks on the door and an old man answers, with a beard almost down 

to the ground. The old man squints his eyes and says ""What do you want?""

The man says ""I've been lost for the past three weeks

and haven't had a decent meal or sleep since that time. I would

be most gracious if I could have a meal and sleep in your house

for tonight""

The old Chinese man says ""I'll let you come in on one

condition: You cannot mess around with my granddaughter""

The man, exhausted and hungry readily agrees, saying ""I

promise I won't cause you any trouble. I'll be on my way

tomorrow morning""

The old Chinese man counters ""Ok, but if I do catch you then I'll give 

you the three worst Chinese torture tests ever known to man.""

""Ok, Ok"" the man said as he entered the old house. Besides, he thought 

to himself, what kind of woman would live out in the wilderness all her 

life?

Well, that night, when the man came down to eat (after showering), he 

saw how beautiful the granddaughter was. She was an absolute pearl, and 

while he had only been lost three weeks, it had been many, many months 

without companionship. And the girl had only seen the occasional monk 

besides her grandfather and well, they both couldn't keep their eyes off 

each other throughout the meal.

That night, the man snuck into the girls' bedroom and they had quite a 

time, but had kept the noise down to a minimum. The man crept back to 

his room later that night thinking to himself, ""Any three torture tests 

would be worth it after that experience.""

Well, the next morning the man awoke to a heavy weight on his chest. He 

opened his eyes and there was this huge rock on his chest. On the rock 

was a sign saying ""1st Chinese torture test: 100 lb. rock on your 

chest"".

""What a lame torture test"" the man thought to himself as he got up and 

walked over to the window. He opened the shutter and threw the rock out. 

On the backside of the rock is another sign saying ""2nd worst Chinese 

torture test: Rock tied to right testicle"".

The man, seeing the rock was too far out the window to be grabbed, jumps 

out the window after the rock. Outside the window is a third sign saying 

""3rd worst Chinese torture test: Left testicle tied to bedpost"".",A man is out in the Chinese wilderness and he's hopelessly lost.,12

 Because it was a small lodging house, there was only one pool where people took a

bath. So the owner told the nuns to take their bath first, then it would be

his turn. But at that time they were busy praying to God, and didn't hear

anything the owner said.

An hour later, the owner thought that it was his time to use the pool, and

he finally jumped into the pool taking a bath. At the same time, those nuns

had finished with their prayer and wanted to take a bath too, so they went

to thol singing.

Hearing someone sing a song and approaching the pool, the man immedietly

jumped out of the pool trying to get his clothes on, but it was too

late...

There were the 3 nuns, taking their clothes off. So he stood still like a

statue with the soap in the right hand and the toothpaste in the left hand.

Of course seeing a naked women gave him an erection. The nuns were

surprised seeing the ""statue"", because they had never seen a naked man

before, they didn't know what a ""penis"" was and accidentally one of the

nuns stroked it hard, the man was quite surprised and dropped the soap.

That nun was glad and said to her friends ""Hey, I get a soap by stroking

this shaft"", The second nun tried stroking again and at last, the man drop

his toothpaste. and she said ""Hey, I get a toothpaste""

The third nun then tried just like her other friends, but the man could

never take it anymore and had one hell of an orgasm. Said the third nun

""Hey, look here girls, I got shampoo"".",3 nuns went to a village and stayed a night at a lodging house.,19

&amp;#x200B;

The first little pig was playing in the forest, when the big bad wolf

spotted him and chased him back to his straw house. The pig hid inside,

peeking out at the wolf, who looked at the house, laughed, then huffed

and puffed and blew the house down. The pig, scared witless, ran

squealing off to his brother's house, where they both ran inside and

locked the wooden door. The wolf, laughing at all the fun he was having,

strolled up and checked out the house. ""Hmmm..."" thought the wolf. He

huffed and puffed, and took two tries to finally blow the wood house

down. The pigs, of course, slipped out the back door and ran for the

oldest brother's brick house as fast as they could. The wolf, laughing

at all the fun, followed. At the third house, the two younger pigs

looked out the window, terrorized as the wolf strode into view, while

the older brother calmly watched from a rocking chair. The wolf looked

all over the house, but didn't think he could blow down the house, so he

left and returned shortly with dynamite, which he started planting all

around the walls. ""Ahhhh!!! We're going to die!"" screamed the two

younger pigs. ""Don't worry about it..."" said the oldest pig as he picked

up the phone and dialed. ""Yeah, it's me... uh huh... yeah...ok."" The

oldest pig hung up the phone and turned to the two younger pigs. ""Don't

worry about it, watch."" The three pigs looked out the window at the

wolf, who was just setting the last of the fuses, when all of a sudden a

black cadillac comes screeching up, and two pigs in fedora hats with

black overcoats jump out, whipping out machine guns and blasting the

hell out of the wolf. With a wave at the house, they leave. The two

younger pigs turn to the older brother and say ""Who the hell was that?""

The older pig looks at them, grins, and says ""Those were the guinea

pigs""",Everyone knows the story of the three little pigs... here's another version:,9

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.

This is for everyone who sends me those heart-warming bullshit stories.","In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University .",26

After getting all his groceries, he sees something interesting at the check-out counter. Not knowing what it is, he asks a worker. The worker replies, “Why, that’s a thermos! It keeps your hot stuff hot, and your cold stuff cold!” Intrigued, the man decides to buy it. He picks out a lovely blue one and plops it down on the check-out conveyer belt. The worker assured him that he will like his purchase, and the man agrees. After all, he often has hot stuff he would like to keep hot and cold stuff he would like to stay cold, who doesn’t? The man promptly leaves the grocery store, and the worker forgets all about the experience. He knew it was a great thermos and was sure the man would enjoy it. However, a few days later the same man storms in. He looks extremely angry and demands to see the worker who sold him the thermos. Upon seeing the worker, the man opens his thermos and flings its contents at him. The worker, now sticky and covered with popsicle sticks, is very confused. He asks the man, “What is this about? Why did you do that?” The man replies, “You lied about the thermos! It doesn’t work at all!” The worker, knowing that the thermos does work and is extremely high quality, asks, “What do you mean? How did it not work?” The man replies, “Well you said that it keeps the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold, right? Well then explain to me why when I got to work my coffee was lukewarm and my ice cream bars were gone!”

A cowboy walks into a bar and orders three mugs of Bud. He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.

The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, ""You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.""

The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado . When we all left our home in Texas , we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.""

The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.

The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.

One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs. All the regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, ""I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.""

The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.

""Oh, no, everybody's just fine,"" he explains, ""It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.""

""Hasn't affected my brothers though.""",A cowboy walks into a bar...,334

 Donald Trump came to London, and met Queen Elizabeth.
 Trump asked the queen saying, ""Your Majesty, I find it much more difficult in political matters than I had imagined, may I ask you how you can operate such an effective government? Are there any tips that you can give me?""
 Well, Her Majesty answered, ""The important thing is to surround yourself with smart people.""
 Trump answers and asks (angry): ""But how do I know that the people around me are really smart?""
 Oh, that's easy. The Queen replied, ""You just ask them to answer a puzzle!""  And the queen pressed the call button: ""Please send Theresa May here.""
 The British Prime Minister entered the room, saying, ""Do you invite me, Your Majesty?""
 The Queen said: ""I ask you to answer me this question, my dear Teresa; your mother and father have a child, not your brother and not your sister who is?""
 And second, Theresa May replied, ""That's me!""
 ""Yes, very good,"" the queen said.
 Trump returned to the White House, and the next day he invited Mike Pence to come to see him.
 Pence Balfour came to the Oval Office.  Donald said: ""Mike, answer me this question if you allow; your mom and dad have a child, not your brother and not your sister who is?""
 ""I'm not sure,"" Pence said.  ""Let me get back to you about that.""
 Pence went terrified to his advisers and asked them all, but none of them managed to give him an answer.
 The next night, Pence rushed to Hillary Clinton and they met in a restaurant.  He looked at her desperately, saying:
 ""Hillary, I know we haven't met face-to-face before, but I really appreciate you, if only you could answer this puzzle!""
 ""Absolutely, Mike,"" Hillary said.  ""what is the Question?""
 ""Thank you,"" Pence said.  ""The question is: your mother and father have a child, not your brother and not your sister. Who?""
 Hillary just answered, ""Easy, it's me!""
 Pence smiled, ""Thank you!""
 Pence Farah quickly returned to Trump and said to him: Sir, I have done some research, and I have the answer to this mystery, it is Hillary Clinton.
 Trump rose from his seat and hit the ground leg, shouting angrily to Pence: ""No, fool! It's Teresa May!""

The Obstetricians felt they were all labouring under a misconception. 

Ophthalmologists considered the idea short-sighted. 

Pathologists yelled, ""Over my dead body!"" while the Pediatricians said, ""Oh, Grow up!"" 

The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while the Radiologists could see right through it. 

The Surgeons were fed up with the cuts and decided to wash their hands of the whole thing. 

The ENT specialists didn't swallow it, and just wouldn’t hear of it. 

The Pharmacologists thought it was a bitter pill to swallow, and the Plastic Surgeons said, ""This puts a whole new face on the matter...."" 

The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists were pissed off at the whole idea.

The woman passive-aggressively asked us to either buy one or let the “angel” have some. We politely declined, as we didn’t have any cash, and were also a little under the weather with colds. She then demanded from us that we needed to give some kind of dessert for her child who was now sobbing.

As part of their new hire training both Lee and Franklin go through a lot of physical training, navigational training, as well as a list of things that is to be packed on the sleigh.

Franklin is going through the list of banned items.  There are weapons, drugs, etc., but one item caught his curiosity...  Cement.  

Franklin says to Lee, “Hey, do you have any idea why cement might be banned?”

“No idea, let’s ask the boss.  I can’t see why anyone would want that,” says Lee

They both go to Santa’s office and ask, “Hey, Santa?  Does anyone ever actually ask for cement for Christmas?”

Santa, in the process of checking his list, puts it down and says, “Yes.  Every year there is a small village by a river that floods constantly.  They ask for as much as they can get to build a wall.  Every year I refuse.”

Both Franklin and Lee look at each other in amazement.  That sounds like a great gift to give a village who needs it.  

Franklin then asks, “But Santa, why would you ban them from having cement?  It sure sounds like they could use it!”

Santa turns to both of them and says...

“Frank, Lee, my deer.  I don’t give out dams.”","As the world’s population swelled over the past few decades, Santa’s sleigh got heavier and heavier, requiring more reindeer to pull it.",49

The old man picked up the phone and called the IRS and an agent says that he noticed some irregularities with his money where there was a large amount of funds going in and out of his account and he needs to come in the next morning at 9 am to discuss it.

The old man says no problem he'll be in at 9. After hanging up the phone he takes a bit to think about it and decided he should probably have a lawyer present with him so he calls his lawyer to have him accompany him.

The following morning the old man and the lawyer arrive at the IRS office where the agent sits down and says that he will have to do an audit for the mans source of income. The old man says well that is because he loves to gamble on damn near anything. The IRS agent says oh really? The old man says that's right, and I'll bet you 5 thousand dollars I can bite my eye. The IRS agent says ok, I'll take that sure bet.

The old man pulls out his fake eye and puts it in his mouth to bite it then replaces it back in his eye socket. The IRS agent goes you son of a bitch. The old man say now hold on a second, I'll let you get your money back and more. I bet 7500 that I can bite my other eye. The IRS agent thinks a moment and not seeing a cane or seeing eye dog the agent says you're on.

The old man pulls out his false teeth and using his hand bites his other eye. The IRS agent is stunned because once again the old man has bested him. The old man says now I can't just let you be down just like that I will give you one last chance. 15 thousand dollars says for you to move your trash can to the other side of the room and I will stand over here 

I bet 15 thousand that I can piss in that trash can and not get a single drop anywhere but in that garbage can. The IRS agent says fine, there is no possible way the old man can do that. So the old man unzips and pisses all over the IRS agents desk. The IRS agent smiles because he won his bet but noticed the lawyer who went pale and and tells the old man you son of a bitch. The IRS agent asks what is wrong to which the lawyer says that on the way in the old man bet him 100 thousand dollars that he would piss all over the agents desk.",Old man,10

post,edbvb3,2qh72,jokes,false,1576856948,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/edbvb3/the_second_anus/,self.jokes,,"One of the foremost experts in holistic yoga and transcendental body modification was in deep concentration. He was working on achieving the ultimate position of bliss. Others had tried (and almost managed) to adopt the incredibly difficult pose but ultimately their limited flexibility and concentration let them down. Only the undisputed master of body rearrangement had any real chance of contorting into the ‘Mount Everest’ of impossible yoga positions. 

After 14 long months of intensely dedicated stretches and pretzel-like practice contortions, Haru Rajnese finally managed to do what no other human being had ever done. His svelte body bent into a previously-thought impossible pose of limbs and intertwined muscle. His left arm was wrapped around his right leg. His left leg was bend around his neck and torso. His lean torso was curved backward in an unnatural, very twisted way. His right arm snaked around his neck like a menacing serpent squeezing it’s hapless prey. His contorted head was between the bend of one knee. A casual observer would’ve thought he was the unfortunate victim of a horrible industrial accident. 

A large gathering of admirers and onlookers came to witness his crowning triumph. The revered yogi was silent in the incredibly complex position for many, many hours. He had systematically removed all air from his lungs in order to achieve the jaw-dropping feat. For this reason, he had to breath only once every three minutes. Speaking was utterly impossible and many of his supporters worried he might be unable to reverse the ridiculous tangled knot of human flesh and bone. Even his fingers were bent awkwardly to facilitate the noble effort.

For hours he remained stationary. The crowd murmured and grew restless. They worried he was in deep distress or incapable of asking for help untangling himself. A few of them decided it had went on for too long. They sought to ‘rescue’ him but were stopped by his assistants. To ‘help’ the guru master would be to bring unforgivable shame upon him. It would undo his greatest triumph since the point was to adopt the inhuman position, and then to return back to normal posture, unscathed. They were exhorted to be patient a little longer. Master Haru knew what he was doing. He would rather die in that tangled mass of unrecognizable body parts that ask for help in undoing it. 

An audible gasp filled the crowd as a single finger began to twitch on the confusing heap of intertwined flesh before them. He was in the slow process of unwinding. Over the next three hours, the focused yogi slowly weaved himself into certain new positions, in order to return. It was the equivalent of being stuck in a ridiculously tight parking spot and having to do a multi-point turn to extract yourself. The way out was through. His mind and body were one. Bones cracked. Muscles twitched involuntarily. Joints were being asked to bend in impossible directions. It was biological madness.

For the first time in many hours, the master blinked a single time. The empty haze in his eyes drifted away. His mind was slowly returning back to consciousness. His chest heaved. There were only a few things left to reposition, for his body to return back to ‘normal’. It was spellbinding to witness but the crowd remained respectfully silent during the final stages. They had been warned that even near the end, speaking to him could break his trance and harm him. With the last few bends, he was ‘back’. 

A slow wave in his muscles signified he was repairing the damage to his tissues for the abuse his body just endured. He took a dramatic deep breath and opened his eyes again. He stood before all the onlookers expressionless. To even smile at his success would be to permit pride. It would negate the entire process of self-discovery and mind over body. He even sought to excise the inner pride he felt. The gathered crowd remained respectfully silent as they had been instructed to be (by the master’s dutiful assistants).

He took a solitary, respectful bow. Soon he would retire to his modest quarters. He desperately needed to rest but before the onlookers could disperse, one impulsive young man couldn’t contain his excitement over witnessing the amazing spectacle. 

He blurted out; “Master! Master! Did you learn anything from your deep exploration of the mind and body?”

The rest of the attendees at the meditation gathering were shocked by his stark breach in etiquette. They were all very curious, but only the one man failed to contain his immediate need to know. Many of those present grimaced from shame or vicarious embarrassment but the questioner remained steadfast in his desire to be answered right then. 

The master made eye contact with the brazen youngster. “I would’ve shared with everyone the details of my journey (when we were together again at the temple), but since you ask now, I shall now answer. In this journey to better know the human mind and body, I just discovered there is actually a second anus on some people. Like the traditional one, it breaks wind without thought and spews forth unnecessary waste. The most surprising thing about this curious discovery is that it resides in the middle of the face. Now, I must retire. I am greatly fatigued by my meditative endeavors. Good evening all.”",‘The second anus’,6

The bartender realizes that trying to have a conversation with a dog is a sign that something might be going wrong with him mentally, so he goes to see a therapist. The therapist diagnoses him with early stage dementia and schizophrenia resulting from a number of factors, in particular the stress from his recent divorce, PTSD from his experiences in the military, and sleep deprivation as a result of an 80-hour work week. 

The therapist recommends that the bartender start taking certain medicine to balance out his mental problems, and also encourages him to ask his boss to lighten his work load, in addition to taking a vacation for a week or so. 

The bartender does these things and starts to experience a positive change in his mental, not to mention physical health. He’s thankful that he was able to take care of these issues before they got out of hand.",Dog walks into a bar,4
