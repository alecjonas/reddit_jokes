That's just fantastic.

That's just enough.

""Just"" may also be used to regard something as fair or deserved.

The judgement was just.
-and-
His reward was just.

It may also reference a recent event.

The game just started.

Which is fun, because ""just now"" (barely now) can mean ""just.""

So, ""The just, just, just, just penalty just came in,"" is a grammatically correct sentence if regarding ""the barely fair, entirely deserved penalty recently came in.""

Something unique about crows is that one crow flys higher than all the other crows, who is known as the watch crow, who communicates with the others and warns them of danger.

One of the lessons is about the types of different jobs adults have...sort of a ""what do you want to be when you grow up"" type of lesson.  

Part of it was asking the students what their parents do for a living.  

""Sally, what does you father do?""  

Sally proudly answers, ""My Daddy is a Real Estate agent, and he helps people sell the house they own now, and buy a better house.""  

""Very good, Sally,"" replies Mrs Jacobson. ""Jimmy, how about you? What does your father do?""  

Jimmy smiles and says, ""He works in a laboratory in a hospital and helps the doctors find out exactly how people are sick, so the doctors can help them get better.""  

Johnny has been sitting at his desk, shoulders slumped and staring down. He's asked, but mumbles something incoherent.  

""I'm sorry, Johnny, I didn't hear you. Could you speak up?""  

Johnny blurts out, ""I said 'My Daddy plays piano in a whorehouse!'""  

Mrs. Jacobson turns white as a sheet, and the whole class goes silent. She marches up to Johnny's desk, rips a piece of paper from his notebook, and scribbles a few lines.  

Folding it, she hands it to Johnny, and firmly commands, ""Young man, you take this note down to the Principal's Office right this minute. Go straight there, and you tell him that I sent you."" She walks briskly to the door and opens it, glaring at Johnny as he meekly walks past her into the hallway.  

He enters the Office, and one of the secretaries asks why he's at the office. ""Mrs. Jacobson sent me,"" and hands over the note. The secretary reads it, gasps, and takes it into the Principal's office. She comes back and says, ""The Principal wishes to see you in his office, *right now*.""  

Johnny walks into the office, and the Principal tells him to close the door, and take a seat. There is an awkward few moments of silence, as the Principal looks at Johnny, then at the note, then back at Johnny.  

The principal asks, ""Johnny, your father doesn't really play piano in a whorehouse, does he?""  

""No, Sir."" Johnny admits. ""He plays defense for the Cleveland Browns, but there's no way I'm telling them THAT.""","""My Daddy Plays Piano in a Whorehouse""",6490

The next day he purchased two large knives, two party hats, two party horns, and a large sausage.

Putting the sausage in his pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorilla's cage, where he tossed a hat, a knife, and a party horn.

Knowing that gorillas were natural mimics, he put on a party hat.

The gorilla looked at him, looked at the hat, and put it on. Next, he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up his horn and did the same.

Then the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage out of his pants, and sliced it in half.

They would chase him around the play ground and call him Oscar Gonorrhea. Obviously, this made him very sad, but it also motivated him. He decided one day that he would never be made fun of again. When he turned 13, he began working out, and he continued to work out everyday until he graduated high school. Despite all of his effort however, his classmates still made fun of him. 

Years went on, and Oscar continued to bulk up. One day, while he was out on the town he heard shouting. He went to the scene of the noise and found a crowd gathered around a car accident. He instantly saw what the fuss was about for underneath the flipped car was a man trapped and fighting for his life. Oscar was sent into shock! Was there no one that could do anything? He quickly sprang into action and lifted the heavy vehicle off of the man. The adrenaline flowing through his veins gave him the strength of ten men. After the amazing feat, he looked around and saw many people he knew staring at him in awe. They began to clap and cheer. Oscar became a local legend, instantly losing his old nickname in favor of a new and improved one: Mighty Oscar Conrea. 

As the years passed people told the story of Mighty Oscar Conrea and everyone loved him. He became a celebrity in his small town. People would ask him to lift heavy stuff and he would do it with ease. Often, he got free meals or movie tickets whenever he went out. But as he got older, Oscar found his strength waning. He could no longer lift as much as he could before. He decided to seek out the help of a psychic. He asked her, ""What must I do to regain my strength?"" The psychic looked into his soul and saw nothing but selfish ambition. She cursed him then and there and said, ""You ask for strength, but Pride is all I see. Until you are more humble, a floral shirt you'll be."" Oscar was caught off guard but in an instant he fell to the ground, transformed into a large-sized flower-patterned T-shirt. The psychic took the ugly piece of clothing to a local thrift store where Mighty Oscar Conrea, now a piece of tacky men's clothing, would sit out the rest of his days. 

No one in the store would ever buy Mighty Oscar Conrea as he was simply too ugly, but people around town did wonder what happened to him. They all missed him and were sad to think that he had left their town. One day however, the thrift store had a sale. Everything was a dollar, and Mighty Oscar Conrea was on the front display rack. His day had come. An old man with terrible taste picked up the shirt to go try it on. When he put the shirt on he gasped. He could hear a voice, not loud or clear, but a voice. And the voice cried out to him ""Help me, the psychic turned me into a shirt."" Instantly, the old man recognized the voice as Mighty Oscar Conrea. He was so excited he bought the shirt and ran home immediately to tell his wife. ""Honey,"" he said, ""I found Mighty Oscar Conrea!"" She asked him where, and he held up his bounty from the thrift store sale. ""You're telling me you found Mighty Oscar Conrea and you stole his shirt?"" Baffled, the man looked at his wife. He took a breath and said, ""No honey, *Migthy O. Conrea IS the Flower Blouse of the Sale*.""",There once was a boy named Oscar Conrea...,0

He lived in a small country in South America. Juan lived a simple life, and was simply happy.
One day, he was sitting in a coffeeshop with a few friends, when the topic of the election for mayor came up. One of his friends said 'Hey Juan, why don't you run? You're a really great guy!' Juan smiled and thanked his friends for their kindness, but they were persistant, as they should be...he was a great candidate and a great guy; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Juan reluctantly agreed, and posted a few signs out to announce his candidacy; he thought of it as kinda a joke Well, as it turned out, when word got around that Juan was running, his popularity grew fast. 'Wow, Juan is running?' 'What a great guy!' 'I heard he doesn't beat his wife, or his kids!' 'Yeah, nor the aarvark in the backyard!' Well, to nobodies surprise (except Juan), he won by a landslide (the other candidate was Oliver North), and was sworn into office with a very surprised look on his face. Well, he saw that there was do getting out of it, so he decided to do his best.
And his best was quite good. The town prospered like it never had before. The crime for the year consisted of someone dropping a lollipop stick on the sidewalk. He spent 6% of the budget, and donated the rest to the Dum Fiters Relief Fund. The townspeople were ecstatic, and his performance turned a lot of heads. Everyone in the town was thrilled with Juan as mayor; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Well, at the end of the year, with his term almost up, Juan was pretty pooped. As he sat in the coffeeshop with his friends, reflecting on the year, one suggested that, despite the town's success, the province was in some financial trouble. 'Heck, with Juan's record, he should be governor!' another smiled. Juan wondered why everyone's eyes lit up suddenly. Within hours the campaign was on. All the ads and posters had the same theme: 'Vote for Juan! He doesn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard!' When election day came, there was no doubt about the winner; Juan had been in the lead since the week he had entered. Governer Juan sat back in his padded chair and went to work once again.
His record was brilliant for the two years he spent as governor. The crime rate fell by 2/3, the budget was balanced, education rose sharply, and the province's Soccer Team sold out every game that Juan attended (he was a big Soccer Buff). The whole country was now buzzing with Juan;s work. Everyone commented how he was such a great guy, how he didn't beat his wife, how he didn't beat his kids, and how he didn't beat the aardvark in the backyard. Then the President was shot. This meant that they needed a new president. Normally, they would turn to the vice-president, except for the fact in this case was that the vice-president was the murderer. Hmm. The Governors got together to decide on a new President for the remaining three years of the term. Each one walked into the room with a mailsack full of letters, all of which has similar messages: 'Juan for President!' 'Let Juan preside as President!' 'How can you not select Juan? He doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, and doesn't beat the aardavrk in the backyard? What else do you want?' To make a very long story not quite as long, Juan was quickly named president, and the country was glad he did. The country prospered; new trade agreements were made, old disputes were settled, and there was peace throughout the country. Juan was a national hero. One day Juan came home from work exhausted. He put his briefcase down and plopped down in his easy chair. His mind was racing, but he was exhausted. He couldn't concentrate...pressure from everyone...lobbiests want this...governors want that....everyone wants this and that and acccccckkkkk!!!!!! Juan looked out the window into the backyard. As usual, the aardvark was out there slurping up ants. Wander....wander....sluuuurp! Wander.....wander....sluuuurp! The monotonous repetition snapped something in Juan's mind. A sudden rage built up inside of him, something evil and uncontrollable. He stood Unfortunatelty for Juan, his neighbour heard the CRACKs and quickly moved the telescope from Juan's upstairs window, where his daughter was undressing, down to the yard, and witnessed the brutal attack. He immediately phoned the police, and within hours, Juan was behind bars, the aardvark rushed to the hospital, and the telescope back up to the upstairs window. The country was horrified, and the citizens called for nothing less than the usual penalty given out for this type of crime....death by firing squad. It was granted, and the punishment was to be carried out swiftly. Juan stood there, broken and insane.
The firing squad levied their guns at him. 'Ready.......' 'Aim.........' Suddenly, and without warning, the aardvark leapt from the shadows, aimed at Juan and fired a golf gun. The shot boomed throughout the town, and the shot itself went clear through Juan's heart and out his back.
You may be asking yourself in between sobs what a golf gun is? This in itself is the morale of the story....
The answer...well, I don't know. But it sure made a hole-in-Juan.",There was once a guy named Juan,0

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home",A father is passing by his son’s bedroom,1263

A lawyer went duck hunting for the first time in the country. He killed a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of the fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. 

The lawyer responded, ""I shot a duck, it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it."" 

The old farmer replied, ""This is my property and you are not coming over here."" 

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own."" 

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in the country. We settle small disagreements like this with the Three-Kick Rule."" 

The lawyer asked, ""What is the Three-Kick Rule?"" 

The Farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."" The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. 

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.

The entirety of its armed forces were split between the north and south of the island. This is the story of the North Irish 5th infantry battalion.
Each soldier had lined up during the onset of the exercise in front of its commander, and each was issued a brand new m16 rifle with the latest laser gear equipped. Each except for Pvt. McConnell. Private McConnell asked his commander ""Oi, why haven't you issued me a gun?!"" to which the commander responded ""You sa, are our secret weapon. Ya dont need no stinkin gun, just point at the enemy and yell Bangity Bang Bang!"". 

McConnell, visibly confused, walked into the field with his fellow soldiers, when he immidiately stumbled across an enemy soldier. He lifted his ""handgun"" and yells out ""Bangity Bang Bang!"" at the top of his voice. The combatant immediately clutches his chest and drops to the ground. McConnell is amazed. ""Wow, i cant believe they gave me this power!""

McConnell ran off from his company in pursuit of more enemy soldiers and quickly ran into an enemy platoon. ""Bangity Bang Bang, Bangity Bang Bang, Bangity Bang Bang!"" He yelled, and the entire platoon drops to the 
ground.

After running around all day feeling invincible, he finds the field office of an enemy lieutenant. He sneaks up to the window, puts his finger to the lieutenants head and yells ""Bangity Bang Bang!"" and the lieutenant collapses. ""im gonna be a hero when i get back!"" McConnel exclaims to himself.

Later on, on his way back to camp from deep within enemy territory, he came across a lone Southern soldier,talking quietly to himself and walking in strict march up the dirt road. McConnell stops in the middle of the road, points his finger at the soldier, and yells ""Bangity Bang Bang!"". The soldier didnt drop, but keeps marching right at him. 

""Bangity Bang Bang!"" McConnell yells again, seemingly ignored by the soldier marching closer

""Bangity Bang Bang!""
""Bangity Bang Bang!""
""Bangity Bang Bang!"", no response.

The enemy soldier pushes McConnell over and stomps all over his face as he continues on down the road chanting ""tankity tank tank, tankity tank tank, tankity tank tank""",Irish Wargames,22

Ole has his hands lightly cupped together as if he's holding a delicate insect from escaping.

""It's a butterfly Sven, I gonna go to town and get me some butter for it!"" Says Ole

""Oh Ole, yer crazy if ya think that'll work!""

Ole smirks and keeps walking towards the nearest town.

An hour later Sven looks up from his porch and sees Ole coming down the road from town holding what looks EXACTLY like 2 pounds of butter on a silver platter, flabbergasted and confused, he saunders back into his house trying to make sense of it.

The next day Sven comes out and sits on his porch again and breathes in the refreshing, crisp breeze and relaxes before his day begins. He sees Ole coming down the road, again, holding something carefully in his hands.

Sven raises an eyebrow in disbelief and shouts ""Ole! Eh whaddaya got there this time?""

Ole smiles and says half-excitedly: ""I caught me a horsefly today Sven! I'll get me a new horse from town for my plow for dis little feller!""

""Oh Ole you know you're the craziest man I know! No one will give ya a whole horse fer that!""

Ole just snickers and laughs and keeps walking towards town.

An hour goes by and here comes Ole galloping on a Brown thoroughbred Stallion, flying past Sven's house making a dust storm. 

Sven gapes his mouth and just stares in utter amazement, completely dismayed at what he saw. 

The next day comes and Sven is outside early, waiting for his warlock of a neighbor to come by and see what he's got this time. And about the same time as the last two days, here come ol Ole with his hands cupped and about skipping down the road.

""Have you really?"" said the photographer. ""Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?""

""Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat ""

After a moment she asked, blushing, ""Well, where do we start?""

""Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.""

""Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!""

""Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.""

""Don't I know it,"" said Mrs. Smith quietly.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider her mother was so difficult to work with.""

""She was difficult?"" asked Mrs. Smith.

""Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.""

""Four and five deep?"" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

""Yes"", the photographer replied. ""And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.""

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ""Do you mean they actually chewed on your, um... equipment?""

""It's true, Ma'am, yes. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.""

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.  I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.  I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do so I started to play.  The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.  As I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.  As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Apparently, I’m still lost...",Big mistake,13

post,7p0aga,2qh72,jokes,false,1515434334,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7p0aga/a_very_wealthy_man_had_a_son/,self.jokes,,"For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died. ",A very wealthy man had a son.,14

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't. So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time, attempted the step, and, once again, and much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.

She went ballistic and turned to the would-be good samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch my body?! I don't even know who you are!'

The Texan smiled and drawled, ""Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we was friends.""",The Blonde at the Bus Stop,408

The emperor asks the Japanese samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be head samurai. The Japanese samurai opens up a matchbox, and out pops a little fly. WHOOOOOSH. The fly drops dead on the ground in 2 pieces! The emperor says, ""That is very impressive!""
Then the emperor asks the Chinese samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be head samurai. The Chinese samurai opens up a matchbox and out pops a little fly. WHOOOOOOSH. WOOOOOOOSH. The fly drops dead on the ground in 4 pieces! The emperor says, ""That is really impressive!""
Then the emperor asks the Jewish samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be head samurai. The Jewish samurai thinks, ""If it works for the other two..."" So the Jewish samurai walks in, opens a matchbox, and out pops a little fly. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSHHHH. A gust of wind fills the room, but the fly is still buzzing around.

""Mr Smith, you are a very brave man. The machine has 10 settings, starting at the very manageable level 1, and going up to level 10, which will give you all of your wife's pain. Let's start you off at 1...""

And so it begins. Mr Smith braces himself, but feels nothing. ""Move me up to level 2, please"" he tells the nurse. Still, he feels nothing. 

He continues to level up, confident that a man's pain threshold is far superior to a woman's. ""Level 10,"" he says, smiling broadly.

""Mr Smith, are you sure? You could easily die...""

He is, however, adamant, and his wife enjoys a pain free labour.

But the editor just can’t believe it one day when the new farmer down the road says that his truck ran into a ditch and killed 2,003 pigs.  He sends his reporter out to the farm to check it out.

The reporter pulls up and finds the farmer working on the fence, so he strolls over and says, “I understand you had a little accident the other day and lost some livestock, is that right?”

The farmer, who seems reluctant to talk, just nods.

“We heard it was 2,003 pigs.  Is that right?”

The farmer frowns a bit and nods again.

“That seems incredible. Are you really sure it was *2,003* pigs?”

The farmer starts to look really upset but again just nods his head.

“Well, my editor wanted me to check it out, because 2,003 pigs just seems like a lot and…”

After healing, she decides to go get a job. The local church decides to find her some work she can do even without arms. She is hired as the new organ player.

Needless to say, her first day as an organ player goes poorly. She quits in shame.

The church decides to hire Emma for another job. She will drive the bus to and from the kids' camps.

But Emma, sans arms, cannot do this job either! She quits in shame.

Finally, there is another job opening at the church, and Emma determines that she will find a way to do this job, whatever it takes! The job is as the bell ringer.

When 1:00 comes around, Emma attempts to ring the bell to no avail. Exasperated, she runs - face first - into the bell, and it let's out a satisfying *bong*.

2:00. *bong, bong*.

3:00 and 4:00 come, and Emma continues to ring the bell. By now she's developed quite a headache. But the day goes on.

5 and 6 and 7 and 8 come and go. *Bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong*.

The headache is nearly debilitating. Slamming her face into the bell nine, ten, and eleven times, Emma calls out in pain.

12:00. Nothing.

With no bell ringing, the parishioners become confused. They move up into the tower to investigate, and see Emma lying bloodied, armless, and unconscious on the floor.

post,7oy6qi,2qh72,jokes,false,1515414276,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7oy6qi/the_northern_horse_race_mogul/,self.jokes,,"A Northern man who bet on horses for a living decided to see what horse races were like down South. 

He met another gambler who said, ""Hey you don't look like you're from around here...let me give you a little tip.""

So the Northerner guy was like ok.

And the Southern guy shows him the most elaborate odds calculations he had ever seen.

""Been doing this a shade over two decades...but I need to retire. And I'd love nothing more than for a Northern man to piss off all the locals by taking all their money.""

He continued, ""Trust me...any one of the top four horses on this chart are going to land you a nice payday today. But whatever you do, don't book the fifth one.""

So the Northern man thought about it...had a drink...and then decided, ""Ah, what the hell, what could go wrong?""

So he decided to trust the Southern guy and just go right down the line.

On the first race, he chose the first horse.

Baaamm...he struck it big.

On the second race, he booked the second horse.

Baaamm...struck it big again.

On the third race, he booked the third horse.

Baaamm...he struck it big yet again.

And on the fourth race he naturally booked the fourth horse.

""By golly I'm on fire!"" he said as he won again.

The Northerner was so impressed with Southern hospitality that he swore he'd find himself good company among the locals.

But they were all pretty pissed off by now. 

By this time, the Northerner was quite intoxicated.

He remembered that there was something about the odds chart that he had forgotten. 

But he blew it off and continued betting. 

Up next was the fifth race.

Tensions arose.

The man was nervous. He swore there was something he had forgotten but he couldn't put his finger on it. 

Anyway, the fifth race began and he placed his wager on horse #5.

As the horse spread around the track, the man noticed he was losing!

""Come on, Bessy,"" he shouted!

""Come on Bessy!""

But the horse just was not keeping up with the pack.

Seeing now that he was about to lose, he hung his head low. 

The Northern man had put all of his money down on this last race...quadruple or nothing.

But then...

Suddenly...

Bessy bolted faster than any horse had ever accelerated.

In a dash never before seen, Bessy burst into action like a cannon ball, quickly passing up all of the other horses. 

""Unbelievable!!!"" the man screamed.

""Come on, Bessy, you can do it!""

Bessy flew passed all of the other horses. She was unstoppable. 

In what seemed like an effortless burst of speed, Bessy rounded all of the corners and beat every last horse.

The South had never seen a race like that before.

Of course, by now the Northern man was cheering, hooting, and hollering.

He cashed in on his winnings and left the race track with a giant grin on his face.

He suddenly remembered doubting the Southern man. He remembered taking his kindness for granted on the last race. 

""I shouldn't have doubted that man...even as I watched Bessy fall way behind.""

The Northerner was still unaware of the advice the Southern man said about the fifth horse. It seemed that he completely forgot it altogether. 

And as the Northerner walked to his car he heard some hooting and taunting. 

He turned around to see the entire pride of the South ganged up with pitchforks and torches as they angrily approached him.

And as they beat him senseless and stole all his money...suddenly the Northerner remembered what the Southern man said about the fifth horse.

And immediately he felt completely foolish. Like a huge bummer.

Filled with intense regret, the Northerner hung his head low, ashamed that he would ever have forgotten the advice the Southern man has given him.

Torn, embarrassed, and in immense pain...he vowed never to mistrust someone that sincere ever again.

""The next time someone like that comes along,"" he said with firm resolve, ""I'm going to trust him and just be grateful for the gift. No questions asked.""

And on that day he gave himself the best piece of advice he'd ever gotten...

""Never book a fifth horse in the South."" ",The Northern Horse Race Mogul,0

Jeweler opens the showcase and shows him a couple of rings for 5 000, 10 000 and 12 000 $. 

The old man takes a look at them and says: ""Nah, I’d like to see something more special”.

So the jeweler presses a small button on the nearby statue and suddenly a secret safe in the wall opens up and reveals a beautiful ring with a giant red ruby on top: “This one is special, it costs 80 000 $.""

As soon as the young woman sees the ring her eyes immediately light up. She grabs man’s hand and silently whispers to his ear.
The man gently answers to her and then says to jeweler: “I’ll take it”.

“How do you wish to pay for it, sir?” asks the jeweler.

“Payment check. I know that you need to call the bank and verify whether the check is fully covered. So take your time, I will return at Monday afternoon and pick up my ring.”

At Monday morning the angered jeweler calls the man and tells him: “I verified your check with bank. You don’t have any money left on your account!”

This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.

The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.

She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.

Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.

The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.

She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.

""What do you mean?"" asked his wife.

""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in.",story about a couple who had been happily married for years with one issue,136

The father paid no mind to the dream until later that day when, as the clock struck midnight, the father received a call from his own father, informing him of his mother's heart attack and subsequent death.

A month later, the boy once again dreamt of a death in the family, this time his cousin's. Again, he told his father about the dream the next day and lo behold, a cousin of his did indeed die at midnight, the same day.

Another month after that, the boy again had a dream. In this dream, it was an aunt of his' turn to rest in peace. Sure enough, by 12 o'clock midnight, one of the boy's aunts passed away.

Sensing a pattern, the father began to believe that his son's dreams were prophetic in nature, which is why he was horrified to hear about his son's dreams a month later.

Son: ""Daddy will die""

He was dumbfounded. He frantically searched for a safe hiding spot as he tightly gripped his phone in case he needed to make a call for an ambulance. He hid himself in the closet as he waited anxiously till midnight. The next day, he got out of the closet breathing a huge sigh of relief. He was baffled, and he felt stupid for being fooled into believing a mere coincidence. That is, until he heard the loud crying and mourning of his wife from the living room.

""May I ask what you might use the product for?""

""Oh, probably all the expected things. I put it on small scrapes the kids get on the playground. Chapped lips in the Winter. My husband applies a thin layer on his tools to prevent rust form forming.  Nothing unusual.""

The man writes all this down, and continues.

""Ma'am, I apologize for asking this next question, but it's on the form; your answers will be kept strictly confidential, and it helps us make a better product. Do you and your husband use Vaseline for any sexual purposes?""

She pauses, blushes slightly, and glances around to see if any neighbors are within earshot.

In an embarassed voice and a slight giggle, she says ""Well... yes, we do"".

His camels were strong but big and slow.

He visits the local camel dealer and asked ""Do you have a camel that can cross the desert in 3 days?"" The salesman replied ""Yes I do! Right over here, this fine young camel can make the journey in 3 days with no food or water stops, and just a few hours rest each night!"" The sheik replied ""That's amazing! I'll take him!"" The salesman said ""Now, I have to tell you he has one little problem. To get him started in the morning, you might have to jerk him off, but he'll travel fast the rest of the day!"" The sheik thought ""That's disgusting, but I need to see my dying father or I will lose my inheritance, so I have no choice....""  He pays for the camel and starts the journey, even though there are only a few hours of light left.

After a short time, the sheik realizes this camel is incredibly fast and nimble, and knows he can make the trip in record time. They travel well into the night. Finally the camel stops and lays down to rest.

The next morning, the sheik wakes up, the camel is stomping the ground, ready to go. He jumps on the camel but the camel won't move.

He jumps off and asks the camel -
""Are you thirsty?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Are you hungry?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Oh shit"" thinks the sheik. ""Do you want me to jerk you off?"" Camel makes a big grin.
Since he is pleased with camel's speed, he figures he has no choice and strokes off the camel. The camel finishes, and impatiently stomps the ground, ready go!

The second day they make incredible speed, and stop to rest late at night. The next morning....
""Are you thirsty?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Are you hungry?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Do you want me to jerk you off?"" Camel makes a big grin, so once again he strokes off the camel.

The third and final morning, the sheik realizes he is only a few hours away from his father and is anxious to go. He wakes the camel up, but the camel refuse to budge.

""Are you thirsty?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Are you hungry?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
""Do you want me to jerk you off?"" Camel shakes his head ""No""
Exasperated, the sheik yells ""What the heck DO you want?""
