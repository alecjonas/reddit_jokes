There was nothing to do there, so to pass the time, he liked to make paper boats and float them in puddles when it rained.

One year, a huge rainstorm hit, and the boy‚Äôs town was completely flooded. The town elders gathered in the town hall, debating how to get everyone to safety. The little boy wasn‚Äôt worried, though. He went to the local library and checked out all of the books. Tearing the pages out, he taped them together into a giant paper sailboat!

The whole town climbed aboard and they sailed off. The paper boat held water! But soon, hunger set in--they had forgotten to take any food with them. Luckily, they soon found a flooded supermarket, filled with enough cans of food to last them well over a year.

The rain stopped, but the floodwaters remained. As the paper ark sailed, the people found the flooded ruins of libraries, and more supermarkets. Using of the paper from the libraries, the humble paper sailboat became a paper barge, and eventually a huge floating paper city. All of the canned food from the supermarkets was enough to feed thousands of people for their entire lifetimes. Not knowing what to do with it all, they built a giant paper cornucopia in the paper town square, overflowing with cans of nonperishable food for everyone to enjoy.

After five years had gone by, the lookout spotted a speck on the horizon. Floating closer, they found a tiny village comprised of wooden shacks along wooden boardwalks. But the away party found it completely deserted, so the paper city floated away, its citizens puzzled.

Five more years passed. Then, the lookout spotted another speck on the horizon. This time, it was a sizable town made entirely of bricks. Again, it appeared to be completely abandoned. The away party scoured the buildings for supplies, but found nothing, so they sailed off.

After twenty years had passed in all, the lookout spotted something gleam on the horizon. The citizens of the floating city were overjoyed; maybe finally they would meet some other people.

And this time, they were in luck! There was an enormous city built entirely of shining metal, with metal streets and metal skyscrapers, with metal boats docked at a metal pier.

The floating paper city dropped anchor nearby, and a small landing party went ashore. The little boy who had made the first paper boats, all grown up now, was among them. He wandered the bustling streets of the vast metal metropolis. He saw metal houses, metal office buildings, and metal stores. Wandering inside a metal supermarket, he saw racks of fresh fruit! After eating nothing but canned food for most of his life, this was very exciting. He picked up a bright red apple and took a bite--it was delicious.

But a moustached man grabbed his shoulder. ""Just what do you think you‚Äôre doing? This is my store! Do people just take food without asking where you‚Äôre from?""

Taken aback, the tourist responded. ""Actually, we share everything. No one goes hungry, and we‚Äôve done pretty well for ourselves if I do say so myself.""

""Oh, you must be one of them floaters. Well, I don‚Äôt care how well your communism works on paper, but it can stay there!""

She approaches a nearby farmhouse to call for a tow. The family patriarch shows her in and lets her use the phone, but the soonest she can be towed is the following morning.

Pa invites the businesswoman to stay for dinner and spend the night, but takes her aside first and warns her: ""I don't know how you big city girls operate, but I won't tolerate any funny business with my two boys.""

The boys are geeky looking, and the businesswoman laughs to herself that Pa's rules won't be too difficult to follow. But that night she can't sleep. Something about the situation makes her crave male attention and she sneaks into the boys' room.

""Boys,"" she says, pulling out her condoms ""I'm going to show you the ways of the world but I can't afford to get pregnant this early in  my career, so I need you to wear these.""

After a night of lovemaking with both boys, the businesswoman snuck back into her room and left early the next morning with the tow truck.

20 years later, the boys were grown, sitting on their porch, when the older boy said ""Remember 20 years ago when that young business-lady broke down and spent the night?""

""Yup""

""She really taught us the ways of the world, didn't she""

But we're still left with another candidate with very similar education and work background, impressive interview... it's practically a tie between you two. So, the Board of Directors has decided to have you both come in to answer a ten question test about our company. Whoever gets the higher score will get the job"".

So the next morning I went to the his office. The other candidate was there - he looked really too smart. So we were told to sit down at two desks, side by side, and were given the test.

After we finished the test, the vice president calls me back into his office. ""Listen... we've scored the tests. You both got nine out of ten, and both missed question #5. But unfortunately we're going to have to pick the other guy.""

""What? Why?"" I asked, shocked. ""But we got the same question wrong!""

In 1st place were the cooks of Drurio with their beautifully cooked stakes. In 2nd place were the cooks of Tumany with their exotic selection of spices. In 3rd place were the cooks of Bastala with their delicious secret sauces. So cooks from these three islands decided to work together in order to make the King a dish.

They presented it to King Brof, who only took a single bite before spluttering and collapsing. His face turned red and swelled up an de he began sweating feverishly. Soon he died from an allergic reaction. His son, Prince Lamd told them that his Father had had an allergic reaction to their spices and now he was going to kill everyone in the archipelago as punishment. The islanders concluded one thing.

Before his next service, he asked the Monsignor how he could relax. ""Next week"", said the Monsignor, ""it may help if you add some gin to the water pitcher. After a few sips everything should go smoothly.""

That Sunday the young priest put his elder's suggestion to the test and really talked up a storm. After the sermon, he asked the Monsignor if he liked it. The Monsignor replied, ""There are 9 things you should learn before addressing the congregation again,

1. Next time, sip rather than gulp the gin.
2. There are ten commandments, not twelve.
3. There are twelve disciples, not ten.
4. David slew Goliath, he didn't kick the shit outta him.
5. We do not refer to our Savior, Jesus Christ and his disciples as J.C. and the boys.
6. Next week there is a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's not a Peter pulling contest at Taffy's

Theodore was hired almost immediately when he applied to one of these companies, and did his job very well. From his bit of law study, he knew that although he should perform repossessions peacefully, if there was no other option he was authorized to use violence and force. He had no problem with this, and he gained reputation rather quickly. Whenever there was a difficult customer, Ted would be sent out to deal with the issue.

After a long silence the man tells his wife ""tell you what, today after work let's go out to that new fancy restaurant and see where the night takes us."" So they finish their meal and return to their jobs.

On the way back to work, the wife's engine starts to smoke up so she pulls over and calls her husband. Being on opposite sides of the city, the man is on his way but it'll take 45 min-1 hour. So in the meantime she calls a mechanic.
 
The mechanic comes and is unable to figure out what's wrong with her car so he calls up his co-worker to come take a look. His co-worker comes but is also unable to figure out what's wrong so he calls his boss. The boss shows up, takes a look, and starts to fix it.

Two minutes later the husband pulls up and asks ""what's going on?"" To which the mechanics smile and reply ""just fixing your wife's problem sir!""",A man and his wife go out to lunch,0

At the event hundreds were there more out of curiosity than anything as the details of the findings were kept secret. The man himself wandered on stage and silenced the murmurs.

'Today I will demonstrate two things. The first is that spiders can understand and respond to basic commands.'

The crowd laughed  and snickered but undeterred the scientist opened a box on his desk and a spider crawled out.

'Spider, walk left'

The spider moved to its left. The crowd was silenced.

'Spider, move right.'

The spider moved right. The crowd gasped. Forward, backward, the spider responded again and again. The crowd applauded in awe.

The scientist then removed all of the spider's legs. The crowd, confused by this, watched in silence.

'Move left'

The spider didn't move.

'Move right'

Nothing. Forward, backward, no response.

'This is to demonstrate my second finding. Once you remove a spider's legs, it goes deaf.'

""Please could you buy my fresh bread, I need the money to pay the bills"" exclaimed the woman wearing tattered clothing

Since Phil and Lawrence are upstanding citizens they instantly pull out their wallets and buy a loaf each. 

They then head off too work.

On the way home from work Phil doesn't look both ways while crossing the road and accidentally gets his toes ran over by a bus. Unfortunately he is rushed to hospital and has his toes amputated.

After 2 weeks of rehabilitation Lawrence decides to treat Phil to a coffee down town. On their way to the coffee shop however the same woman calls them over to their store.

""Hello, I remember you both. Would you be so generous to buy my fresh eggs? As you know it is going to a good cause."" urged the woman sitting on a broken stool.

Again, Phil and Lawrence forked over the cash and helped themselves to some fresh eggs.

They go for their coffee and head home.

Lawrence calls Phil and explains that he is out of town for a few days so he can't go into town with him tomorrow.

The next day Phil decides to take a morning stroll alone down the usual street and low and behold the same woman is sat behind her stall beckoning Phil over.

""Hello there! Would you be interested in my cow's milk? Fresh from this morning!"" handing Phil a bottle of milk.

Phil declines the bottle of milk.

The woman sits there disgusted. ""Why wont you buy my milk? My rent needs to be paid! Please!"" pleaded the woman almost bursting into tears.

""I'm sorry"" Phil groaned

He decides the best way to get ahead is to find prisoners of a similar mindset and join then.

He sees some skinny white dudes coming in from a back area. Figuring that's a fairly private place to make his pitch, he approaches them.
""Not now dude"", one of them says, ""we've just been out blowing bubbles and need to get back before the warden catches us!""

The skinhead is a bit shocked. Blowing bubbles? Obviously these guys are wimps, so probably not the best crew to join up with.

The next day, he spots some tough biker-looking dudes coming from the same alcove. He again tries to approach them but gets rebuffed,
""Busy blowing bubbles! Get lost or come back when it's your turn!""

Now he's intrigued. Maybe bubbles is slang for drugs? Cocaine maybe? He still has sources on the outside, so maybe this is his way in.

The third day, the warden himself is coming out of the alcove, bleary-eyed and with a filmy substance on his lower nose. The skinhead tries to ask about it but gets the same
""fuck off and wait your turn!""

""This is it,"" he thinks. If the whole prison is addicted to blow, then with his supply chain he's going to OWN them.

So the next week he's been set up by his supplier, and heads out early to slip into the alcove, waiting for a potential ""customer."" 

Within an hour, a MASSIVE black guy, rippling with muscles, shows up.

The skinhead thinks, ""I own this guy, and he'll keep everyone in line for me.""

To the big guy he says, ""you must be here for some bubbles?""

The bug guy pauses, confused, then laughs and pulls off his belt.

The First Mate quickly got the Captain's red shirt, which the captain put on. Then he led his crew into battle against the mean pirates. Although there were some casualties among the crew, the pirates were defeated.

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending two boarding parties towards their ship. The crew was nervous, but the Captain,  calm as ever, bellowed, ""Bring me my red shirt!"" And once again the battle was on! 

The Captain and his crew fought off the boarding parties, though this time more casualties occurred.

Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's events when an  ensign looked at the Captain and asked, ""Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?""

The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, explained, ""If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the blood, so you men will continue to fight unafraid."" The men sat in silence. They were amazed at the courage of such a man.

As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command.

When asked what his final decision is, he says that, despite having had a great time in heaven, he thinks that hell is a better fit for him. So he heads to hell with Satan.

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

After a few minutes, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.‚Äô

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely.

Now nude, she purred at him, ‚ÄòWhat would you say is my best feature?‚Äô

The old man unwraps the plain hamburger and carefully cuts it in half. He places one half in front of his wife. He then carefully counts out the fries dividing them into two piles and neatly placing one pile in front of his wife.

He takes a sip of the drink, his wife takes a sip and sets the cup down between them.

As he begins to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them keep looking over and whispering.""That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.""

As the man begins to eat his fries, a young man comes to the table. He politely offers to buy another meal for the couple.

The old man replies that they're just fine - they're just used to sharing everything.

The surrounding people noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She sits there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink.

Again the young man comes over and begs them to let him buy another meal for them. This time the old woman says,""No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything,""

As the old man finishes and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again comes over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asks,""May I ask what is it you are waiting for?""

So Trump and Jack went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.
Trump thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammed'. And Jack said 'My name is Jack'.
The Arab man said 'Hello Jack.' And told these other men to take Jack and give him food and drink.
