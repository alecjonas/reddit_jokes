A hunter was on the grounds and he thought to himself, ""If only that fly would drop six inches, the fish would catch the fly, the bear would catch the fish, and I could shoot that bear."" The hunter had a cheese sandwich that day, and a mouse wished, ""If only that fly would drop six inches, that fish would catch the fly, the bear would catch the fish, the hunter would shoot the bear, and I would be able to get his cheese sandwich."" A cat was nearby too, and said to itself, ""If only that fly would drop six inches, the fish would catch the fly, the bear would catch the fish, the hunter would shoot the bear, the mouse would scramble for the cheese, and I would catch that mouse.""

Then, the fly did drop six inches, got eaten by the fish, which was captured by the bear, which was shot by the hunter, whose cheese was stolen by the mouse, but the cat slipped and fell straight into the lake.

A man was getting a haircut prior to a trip to Rome. He mentioned the trip to the barber who responded, ""Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?""

""We're taking American Airlines,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""

""American Airlines?"" exclaimed the barber. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?""

""We'll be at the downtown International Marriott.""

""That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?""

""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""

""That's rich,"" laughed the barber. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. You'll be at the back of St Peter's Square and from that distance he'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.""

A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome.

""It was wonderful,"" explained the man. ""Not only were we on time in one of American Airlines's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!""

""Well,"" muttered the barber, ""I know you didn't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.""

""Really?"" asked the Barber. ""What'd he say?""

He said, ""Where'd you get the shitty haircut?""

Everytime when the trucker comes home he will bring his wife a piece of clothing.
Well after all these years the wardrobe they shared got pretty full and there wasn't much space for the husbands clothes left.

The wife thought: why dont i buy a new wardrobe for my husband while he is gone as a surprise, so he has enough space for his clothes aswell! 
The wife goes to a nearby store and buys a beautifull wardrobe and has the company set it up for her. As the employees leave she goes back to her living room. At this moment a train passes by and she hears a loud smack coming from the bedroom. She goes to the bedroom and sees the new wardrobe in pieces.
She immediatly calls the company and tells them wat happened. The company sends back the employees and they put it back together. Then an hour later as another train passes the wardrobe breaks again. She calls the company but they just started closing so they promised her that first thing in the morning they would send someone over.

So the next morning a employee arrives and asks what happened. So if i get this right, everytime a train passes the wardrobe just breaks? Thats right! The woman replies.
Well i'll tell you wat i'm gonna do, i'm going to sit inside the wardrobe and wait for a train to pass to see wat happens on the inside. 
The wife agrees to this plan and goes downstairs. Its at this time that the husband comes home from his job. 
Wife: oh hey honey i got a surprise for you upstairs. 
So the husband runs upstairs and sees his new wardrobe, he opens it up and sees a man inside.
Husband: What the hell is the meaning of this?!?!
Employee: well sir, would you believe me if i told you i was waiting on the train?",New wardrobe,3

""Yes, I think I did."" The man shows the owner the two records, one labeled, 'The Best of Johann Sebastian Bach', and the other, 'The Works of Claude Debussy'.

My son has become a christian! Whatever shall I do?"" In reply, the other rabbi tell him ""Funny you should ask! My own son has just converted to Christianity!

So, both rabbis take a road trip to the largest synagogue in the state. They say to the rabbi: ""Rabbi, rabbi! Both of our sons have converted Christianity! Whatever shall we do?"" And the rabbi says ""Well, funny you should ask! My own son has just converted to Christianity! Come with me, we'll catch a plane to Jerusalem and get this sorted out.""

So, all three rabbis fly from the US to Jerusalem. They find the oldest, wisest rabbi they can, and in unison, cry out ""Rabbi, rabbi! Our sons have converted to Christianity! Whatever shall we do?"" And the old rabbi says ""Funny you should ask! My own son has just converted to Christianity! Come, let us go to the Wailing Wall. God will surely have an answer to such a conundrum.""

So, all four rabbis run as fast as they can to the Wailing Wall and drop to their knees, shouting to the sky ""Holy father! Our sons have left us for Christianity! Whatever shall we do in these times of darkness?""

""Yeah,"" replies the guy. ""He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he swallowed that cue ball, he measures stuff first.""",A man walks into a bar with his pet monkey,399

Across the park... the father asks the boy, ""What animal is that?"" and the boy responds ""That's a crocodile!"" and the father says, ""Nope! That's a alligator, son. You can tell by the V-shaped snout."" And the boy learned.

And the boy says ""Oh cool! Is that were Mommy's penis went?""

Edit: I forgot to mention that the father previously had explained to his son Jeffrey that ""all women originally had penises but eventually they would wither off and die like dead skin"" - a harmless myth created to deter his child from growing up believing men and women were different; the question was answered with good intention. 

So... when Jeffrey referred to the snake as ""Mommy's penis"", he was simply rationalizing his experience by utilizing his prior understanding of what pensis' are... believing that ""once detached from a woman's body, the penis could still survive in the wild.""

I rush around the flat searching for him! i run out onto the balcony and see a pair of hands hanging on to the edge of it. so i start stamping on them, but the ba*tard wouldn't let go, so i run inside and grab a hammer from my toolbox and smacked the as*holes fingers with it till he finally let go. I watch him fall but he landed in bushes and he's getting up! He was fine! I was fuming!!!! I ran in, grabbed the fridge and threw it down on top of the tos*er and killed him!

I'm screaming at him to stop and he did and I almost get up but he starts smackin me wit a hammer! so i had to let go.

He had been there for a while and was longing to liven up his stay there so he decided to enter the next one. There was a shop in town that he could buy sculpting supplies from and the guys in command had given him a few days before his next assignment, so he rode in on his trusty mule and came back with all of the chisels and saws he needed.

That evening, the SEAL started work on his masterpiece. He loved sites like reddit and imgur, so naturally he decided to sculpt a life sized Good Guy Greg. Both day and night he worked at it until it came to the day of the ice sculpting competition.

There were some good sculptures at the event, but the judges loved his work so much that the SEAL won first prize. To celebrate, he went hard out on the town with some of the locals.

A few hours later, despite being nearly blind drunk, he remembered he'd left his statue and mule outside. There was a blizzard due that evening and his trusty pet would surely die if he didn't get back in time.

The navy SEAL stumbled back as soon as a drunk man could and with his stomach turning and his head spinning, he set to loading up the sculpture onto the sled.

Just as he'd got one foot of the sculpture on the sled, he slipped, lost balance and fell to the ground, with 150kg of ice crashing down square on his shin. He was trapped underneath.

Despite the numbing whisky in his system, a terrible shooting pain raced up his leg. It must be broken. The SEAL remembered his training and tried not to panic, but the sculpture was impossible to lift. He called his mule over to try and budge it. No such luck.

""If only there was a way I could make it lighter"", thought the SEAL. Then, an idea hit him. All he'd have to do is heat up the ice sculpture and then it would just melt away until he was able to lift it.

He started to breathe heavily into the ice, but to no avail. He emptied his bladder, but that only froze and made things worse. With his last throw of the dice, he beckoned his trusty mule over and got him to lie down on the ice, hoping his body heat would lessen the load, even slightly. The wind picked up and snow was falling so quickly that he could barely see outline of his pet, doing all that he could to save his master.

He waited. Nothing. He gave it some more time. Nothing. He tried to hold out for longer. Nothing. The sculpture was no lighter and he was drifting in and out of consciousness.

Suddenly, a chilling thought hit him. His heart pounded against his chest and a cold sweat broke across his brow as he realised that it was all over. He realised...

After a long life of being disabled, at the age of 64, she decides to take a vacation to Beliz. On the first day of her vacation she's sitting in her wheelchair down by the water and starts to whimper. A local, by the name of Michael, is walking along the shore and notices the woman in distress. Michael walks over to Sally asking, ""is everything okay miss?"" 
Sally, whiping a tear from her cheek, responds saying ""Thank you young man for caring, but no I'm not okay."" She informs him she's a paraplegic and tell him of the accident. ""As you can see I've been stuck in this chair since I was 4 due to the accident and because of the burns on my face no man has ever loved me. I've never even been kissed."" 
Being a nice guy, Michael says he'd be more than happy to be her first kiss. He kisses her and continues on his way making Sally a very happy paraplegic. 
The next day Sally rolls down to the same spot in hopes of seeing Michael again. To her luck, she sees him approaching in the distance, pinches herself, and works up a stream of tears. Michael takes notice and runs to her side to see what's wrong. 
""Sally! What's wrong, are you okay?!"" he asks. 
""No, I'm not okay,"" she responds. ""After experiencing what a slice of intamacy felt like after you kissed me yesterday, I realized that's as far as it'll ever go for me. No man will ever want to pleasure me orally or any further,"" she sobs.
It was her lucky day. Michael, being a nice guy, makes sure the coast is clear as the sun is setting and tells Sally, ""You know what? I'd love to be the man who does that for you."" After 15 minutes of oral fixation, Sally lets out a roar of pleasure held within her for so many years. Michael licks his lips and continues on his way knowing he made someone less fortunate than himself, very happy. 
The next few days go by and Sally rolls down to her favorite spot in hopes of seeing Michael again, but never does. It's the last day before Sally must return home and makes one last effort to see the man that has made her so happy. Right as she's about to leave the beach and set home, almost losing all hope, she sees Michael in the distance once again. She quickly jags herself in the pussy (funny enough one of the few places she still has feeling in) with a seashell in order to whip up a flood of tears. Bawling and screaming she yells out Michael's name. He hurries over to her to make sure she's okay.
""Sally! Sally! Are you okay?! What's wrong?!"" He asks.
Barely being able to speak through all the pain she manages to tell him, ""well Michael this vacation has been great and you've done so much for me and I've experienced things I've never experienced before thanks to you. However I'm leaving tomorrow morning and I feel this is my last chance and you're my only hope so I'm just going to come out and say it. You've been so kind and caring to an old handicapped woman in a way no one else has. I was hoping you'd take my virginity before I die. I've never been with a man and I've wanted nothing more to this day than to be fucked. I want you to fuck me so I can die a happy woman knowing I've completed the last thing on my bucket list. Fuck me, Michael. Please I need to be fucked!"" she begs.
Michael, being a nice guy..agrees.
He picks Sally up out of her chair and tosses her over his broad shoulders and sprints down to the ocean. And throws her in.
""NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!"" he shouts out. And laughs and laughs and laughs all the way home knowing he helped fulfill Sally the paraplegic's wish of being fucked.

The way his over sized shlonge hung down the side, and how hard it got when he slowly licked from the base to the tip. The other man awoke with a ""the fuck?"" Then looked down and smiled a nasty grin.......
.... nasty grin. It was SUCH a turn on, and the man knew it. The man grabbed Jimmys hair and slammed his massive cock into his mouth, hearing a gurgle sound he let off, but not by much. Slamming and yanking his head up and down, faster and faster. Jimmys throat started to burn but he was happy to do it for this man alone! Feeling it cumming (see what I did there ;D) he braced himself as his hips forced up. A dark ""uhhhh!"" Came from deep below as Jimmys mouth was flooded with Jizz, so much that he almost gagged........
Gagged.... Jimmy couldn't help himself but to spit it out immediately. All the goop spilling out on his shlonge and pubes. Feeling a slight embarrassment he started licking it off his dick and pulling it out of his pubes with his teeth. Not spitting out the few that stayed in his mouth, he then swallowed it, pubes and all! A slight disgust filled his stomach, but he was ok. It then occurred to him ""oh shit! Does he have the HIVA-CLAPA-ARIA!?!?"" But the man read his mind and assured him he was clean. As the man put his cock away and stood up to leave Jimmy had to ask ""What is your name?"" The man smirked and said ""the names Pan....... Peter... Pan...."" As Peter walked out the door and slid his gay green hat on he stood a faggot pose and then....... Flew off to never land.....
Never land........ The next day Jimmy woke up from a raging boner that wouldn't subside. Giving up ""fuck it"" he climbed out of bed and poured a bowl of dick flavored Cheerios. He sat down on his couch and turned on NBC. The headline ""MORE BULLSHIT IN SYRIA"" ran across the top of the screen, then on the small scroll said ""new information... Bush Did 9/11"" and then... ""BREAKING NEWS!!! New reports claim that child molester Michael Jackson has been dressing up in a (gay) Peter Pan costume and forcing (gay) ""young people"" to do sexual acts to him. If you know anything of this please tell local authorities, if you have been abused by Michael please burn your mouth."" Jimmy then climbed to the crest of the valley, pulled his dick out and belly flopped 20 stories onto his dick which exploded and covered all of Candy Land in Jizz.

I was working out of town and staying in a motel.  After some drinks I'm walking back to my room and in this hallway there are 2 people walking towards me and maybe twenty feet behind them is my buddy coming in from a smoke. 
The two guys were walking to their room and talking to each other and it was just obvious they were Canadian. (We were also about 20 miles away from Canada so there was that)  I'm about to walk past them but instead a light bulb shines above my head.

Me: You guys are from Canada yeah?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Did you know Canada used to be called CND?
Them: No. How's that? (They were still nice and cordial at this point)
Me: Well originally Canada was called CND. The US called them and asked how that was spelled and they heard, 'C eh, N eh, D eh.'
Them: Get the fuck out of here.

Swear it's a true story.  I asked my buddy who had just come in from smoking if I was being some kind of drunken dick and he said no and he thought it was a stupid joke but kinda funny.  

TL:DR I pissed off two canadians.  I didn't even know that was possible. Maybe they're the exception to the rule?

He had several hundred young layers (hens), called 'pullets,' and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs. 

He kept records, and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. 
Keeping track of the roosters took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.

Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell from a distance, which rooster was performing. 
He just sat on his porch and filled out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells. 
John's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen, but this morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! 

When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets, hearing the roosters coming, ran for cover. 

To John's amazement, old Butch kept his bell in his beak, so it didn't ring. 
Butch would sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. 

John was so proud of old Butch, he entered him in the County Fair and he became an overnight sensation 
among the judges. 

The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the No Bell Piece Prize but they also awarded him the Pulletsurprise as well. 

Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making.

The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen.

The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.

They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, ""In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the testicles and time how long it takes for you to get back up. Then you kick me in the testicles and time how long it takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker wins the egg.""

The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman put on the heaviest pair of boots he could find. He took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and kicked him as hard as he could in the testicles.

He was about 7, and went to kindergarten. Every day, little Johnny would ride the bus to and from school. And boy, did he love riding the bus. You see, he shared the bus ride with his best friend and pseudo-mentor, Joe. Now Joe was a cool teenager; he was a high schooler, and even had a girlfriend! Joe was everything Johnny aspired to be and more.

One morning, Johnny sat down on the bus and waited eagerly for Joe’s stop. As the bus slowed to a stop, Johnny got up on his knees in order to see Joe. Joe, cool as ever, waited with his hands in his pockets and leaning on a wall. He looked at Johnny as he entered the bus and Johnny saw that Joe wore the biggest smile on his face that Johnny had ever seen! So when Joe sat down, little Johnny asked Joe, “Hey Joe, what happened to you? Why are you so happy?” 

And Joe, he looked around to check if anyone was paying attention, got really close to Johnny, and whispered in his ear, “I did something with my girlfriend last night for the first time.” Johnny giggled and asked what it was. Joe looked around again, and, as if he were afraid to exclaim it, ripped out a small piece of paper and wrote, “I gave my girlfriend the Pink Feather!” before letting Johnny read it and swallowing it to destroy the evidence.

Now Johnny was just a kid; he didn’t know what the Pink Feather was, so he shyly voiced his innocent question, “Joe, what’s the Pink Feather?” And little Johnny was met with the coldest, emotionless gaze from Joe which Johnny could feel piercing his soul. 

Joe told Johnny, “Look Johnny, I know we’ve been friends for a long time, but I just can’t hang out with a kid so ignorant. As of right now, you’re dead to me. We’re never talking again.” 

And Johnny froze. Was this some sort of joke? Did Joe really mean they wouldn’t be friends anymore? Was this all because of that Pink Feather? They sat in silence until the bus stopped in front of the elementary school. Johnny had to climb over Joe, who wouldn’t even make eye contact with the poor kid. “B-bye Joe.. See you after school, ok?”

At school, Johnny eventually came to the conclusion that there’d be no way that Joe would stop being his friend over something so silly. He’d either get over it, or reveal the cruel joke after a few days. So that afternoon, Johnny waited for Joe on the bus. Joe sat far away from Johnny, not even casting a glance in his direction. It hurt, but Johnny knew it’d be ok soon enough.

A few days went by without any contact between the two. Eventually Joe stopped taking the bus altogether. He probably got a ride from one of his high school friends. That day at school, Johnny was visibly distraught. The weight of losing his best friend came crashing down on him, and he couldn’t bear the pain anymore. Johnny cried and cried, and a teacher had to pull him outside to ask what was wrong.

He whined, “Muh-my friend… Joe.. He.. He said he wouldn’t be my friend no more!”

The teacher crouched down to get at eye level and asked him, “Why’s that Johnny? I couldn’t imagine anyone not wanting to be friends with such a polite kid as you!”

And Johnny said, “because.. I.. I didn’t know what the Pink Feather was!” And his teacher stood straight up. She was disgusted with Johnny and sent him to the Principal’s Office without another word. He waited for hours, saw his teacher come by after class and leave, giving him a dirty look, and Johnny waited some more. Eventually his parents came by to pick him up! They sat with Johnny, and his father told him, “you are in a lot of trouble young man! Just wait until the principal tells us what you did!”

After what felt like an eternity, Johnny and his parents were called into the office where the principal told them that Johnny had a foul mouth, but the teacher refused to repeat what Johnny said. They asked Johnny to repeat it and Johnny slowly said, “I just said that, because of the Pink Feather, Jo-“

Johnny was interrupted twofold when his mother started bawling, and when his father immediately covered Johnny’s mouth and gave him a few spankings right there in the principal’s office. The principal exclaimed, “we don’t tolerate this kind of behavior here. Get that child out of here and don’t bring him back! I’ll make sure no school in the state will school him!”

So Johnny went home and was sent straight into his room. He heard his parents scream at each other for a long time, and heard his name quite a bit as well as a lot of words he didn’t recognize. Johnny was scared to death and could barely sleep at all that night.

The following morning, Johnny’s father woke him up with a bucket of ice water and immediately started to explain, “Johnny, your mother and I have had a long discussion and she can’t handle having raised a monster such as you. So we’re sending you to a therapeutic boarding school until you’re ready to live by yourself. This is goodbye Johnny; we have a driver outside waiting to take you away.”

So little 7-year-old Johnny had to say good-bye to his father for good (his mother wouldn’t see him out), and move to a boarding school. It was at this point that Johnny vowed never to mention the Pink Feather ever again. So he went through school, living with troubled kids, and eventually received a GED without any more trouble from the Pink Feather. He even made it into college! 

Without a place to go home to, Johnny moved into the dorms and met his roommate, Steve. Steve was a pretty friendly, but quiet guy, and they both got along great. In fact, they shortly became best friends. They were inseparable all throughout their undergrad years, and Johnny even came to Steve’s home for holidays and vacations. They both decided to continue their education and receive a PhD, so they stayed close friends for many more years. 

One day, Steve decided to ask Johnny a question that had been pressing at his mind (and that Johnny avoided) for a long time, “Johnny. Why don’t you have friends from your childhood? Why don’t you ever go home to visit your parents?”

Johnny sighed, took a good moment to muster up the courage, and Steve continued, “Johnny, we’ve been best friends for almost 10 years now. You can tell me anything.”

With this, Johnny was satisfied that he could share his deepest darkest secret with Steve. “When I was a child, I was kicked out of public school and disowned by my parents because I talked about the Pink Feather. And I don’t even know what it is!”

Steve was packed up and out of the dorm within the week. Johnny, exasperated, went for a good long walk around town to gather his thoughts. *I lost my bests friends in the world. My family. My home. Everything. And it’s all because I don’t even know what the darned Pink Fea-* BAM. Johnny was so deep in thought, he wasn’t paying attention to his path and got hit by a bus.

She was a bit of an attention seeker and we were really close. After school, I'd go over to her house (I never really knew the address, I just followed her home) and we'd just sit down in her living room and talk, do some crack (this is why we were close), etc. Never been to the other rooms in her house aside from the bathroom and kitchen. One day, she wore her favorite velvet dress (she doesn't wear it when I come over because she doesn't want to rip it) and told me that she was tired of coke and wanted something else. Luckily, I knew this kid at school who made meth (He'd stay late and sneak into the lab to make it, and he even said that he has his own ""family recipe"" and bought some off him. After we took some of it in her bedroom the last thing I remember was telling her that she bloomed like a rose after she ripped her velvet dress trying to take it off. The sex part was blurry, but I remember what happened afterwards; She told me that I fell asleep while banging her. I said goodbye (she wasn't listening though), put on my clothes, and left.

Fast forward to now: We've both quit the habit, and I was able to find the girl's contact info (she works for a big-name company now) so I called her up. After a while she brought up the incident above, and we began talking about our teenage druggie days. I wanted to meet up with her, and asked her about her parent's house. Apparently the area around it got renovated (new layout and everything), but her house is still where it always was. Since she visited it regularly, I asked,

For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died. ",The story of the pink ping pong balls (semi-long read),12

At he gets closer he sees it's the outline of a blonde woman sitting in a beach chair near the water.  He walks up behind her about to ask her what the matter was.  Before he says anything, he notices that she doesn't have any arms or legs.  Thinking it's a bit weird, he still decides to see what was wrong.

""Why are you crying"" he asks the young lady.

""Nobody likes me.  I came here on a date with a boy I met online, but after one look at me he just left.  My best friend dropped me off, but she won't be back for another couple hours.  I have nowhere to go and I'm stranded."" sobbed the woman.

The man felt very bad for this young lady.  Besides her missing arms and legs, she was actually pretty good looking.  After talking a little more with her she makes a confession.

""I'm so pathetic.  I've never even been kissed before"" she cried.  

The man thinks to himself and looks around.  There is nobody else within view on the beach.  He thought, what the heck.  He leans over and gives the woman the most passionate kiss he could.  Her crying stopped momentarily as she thanked him.  However, she started crying shortly after.

""I'm so pathetic.  No boy has ever tried to feel me up."" she cried.

The man started getting a little more weirded out, but again there wasn't anyone looking.  She did have very nice breasts, so I decided what the heck.  He grabbed as her large and tender breasts and played with them for a little while.  After a few minutes he stopped, and she seemed a little happier.  After a few seconds she starts crying even harder than before.

 “You know bud,” the world-weary bartender says, “I’ve been in this business for a long, long time and it will take something pretty freaking special to impress me but if you think you can give it a shot”.

The man smiles and lifts a carry-on type suitcase onto the bar, opens it, reaches in and withdraws a small grand piano and places it on the bar. He reaches in again and this time takes out a small matching piano bench and put it on the bar in front of the piano. Next he takes out several pieces of sheet music appropriately sized and puts that on the piano.  He stops and looks up at the bartender, smiles and says “Prepared to be amazed!” 

Then with a flourish he reaches in and gently removes a very small man wearing a tuxedo and places him on the bench. After a few seconds of getting himself comfortable and arranging the music he starts playing Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata.

The bartender’ drops open as he listens  to the music. After a minute he says “Wow! I gotta say it. I am impressed. What are you drinking?”

“Bourbon,” the man responds enthusiastically.

The bartender is mesmerized by the music and as the musician moves through the sonata’s movements he keeps
 refilling the man’s glass. A small crowd has gathered and when he finished the people applauded wildly. The little musician didn’t stop there but kept playing. Mozart, Bach, Joplin and ended his performance with a pedal to the metal version of Great Balls of Fire. 

When he was finished the man put everything back in the case and started to leave but the bartender grabbed his arm and stopped him.

“You gotta tell me where he came from,” he demanded  

“Well,” said the man “that’s a funny story. It happen a couple of years ago when I was visiting family in Ireland. I went out for a walk one day in a wooded area and heard a voice calling out. A little squeaky voice. He seemed to be calling for help. So I left the path a come across a leprechaun who had his head stuck under a large rock.” He stopped and looked at the bartender but he said nothing so the he continued. “The rock was big and it took me a few minutes to move it but when I did he jumped up and gave me a hug and said he was very grateful for what I did and would grant me a wish”.

“And this is what you wished for?” said the flabbergasted bartender.

“Not really,” said the man. “The rock sitting on his head must have damaged his hearing and so I ended up with a 12” pianist.

However, he was not a nice man to be with. Frequently would he shout at his subordinates, threaten them, bully them, make subtle sexual advances at them, or generally intimidate them.  He actively went out of his way to assert dominance in every way he could.  His focus was himself and himself only, and he effectively mandated everyone's submittance to him.  He was really a terrible piece of work.

So they loaded  up John's minivan and headed north.  After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard.          

So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.    
                      
'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained,' and I'm afraid the neighbours will talk if I let you stay in my house.'
                                      
'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn.    And  if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.'
                              
The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.
                               
Come morning,  the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.           
                       
They enjoyed a great weekend of golf.                      
           
But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney.          
                       
It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the golf weekend.                           

He dropped in on his friend Shawn and asked,  ""Shawn, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our golf holiday in Scotland about 9 months ago?'                         

'Yes, I do,'  said Shawn.  'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?'      
                                   
'Well, um, yes!,' Shawn said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have  to admit that I did.' 

'And did you  happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?' 

Shawn's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.  Why do you askk?'

curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from other boys
and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his
questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining
things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and
watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following
morning Johnny described everything to his mother.

Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off
most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis
must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have
thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,
just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because
he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.

He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started
panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting
cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the
end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever
because sis told him she was really HOT.

Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had
gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood
there about 9 inches long. HONEST! anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep
it from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes big
and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff
like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!

""Anyway"", sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting its head
off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit
her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he
took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep
it from biting again.

Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on
it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell
of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost
upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between
them.

After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her
boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel... I knew it was
dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging
out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they
went on courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. And by
golly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to
fight again.

I guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something.
This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After
about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was
dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush
it down the toilet.

Mother fainted.

post,3f6lhw,2qh72,jokes,false,1438276792,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3f6lhw/the_bear_joke/,self.jokes,,"A group of men go up into the mountains to go bear hunting. The first morning out, Bill goes out on his own. He comes to a clearing on a hill overlooking a field and sees a bear slowly strolling across the field. He gets the bear in his sites and fires. He then looks all around, but he can't find the bear.
All of a sudden, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around, and there's the bear. The bear knocks the gun out of his hands, and Bill stands there shaking in his boots.
The bear yells at him, saying he's sick and tired of being shot at and gives Bill an ultimatum. The bear tells him that he can either drop to his knees and blow him, or the bear will eat his face.
Bill immediately drops to his knees and obliges the bear. The bear walks away contented and Bill find his way back to the cabin.

The next morning, Bill takes an even bigger gun with him and goes to the same place he saw the bear before. And sure enough, there was the bear strolling across the field again. Bill gets all excited, gets the bear in his sites and shoots! He looks all around, but there is no bear. All of a sudden he feels a tap on his shoulder again. He turns around, and, surprise, there's the bear. The bear looks at him, knocks the gun out of his hand, and says,''You know the routine.''
Bill drops to his knees and obliges the bear again. When he's done, the bear walks away smoking a cigarette and Bill stumbles back to his cabin.
Bill is all pissed off now. He grabs the biggest gun he can find and heads to the same spot again. And sure enough, there is the bear strolling across the field again. He gets the bear in his sites, and says to himself, ''Now this bear's gonna fuckin' get it!'' He pulls the trigger and, ""Ka-BOOM!"" He looks all over again, but no bear. Then, just as before, he feels the same tap at his shoulder. He turns around, there's the bear standing there with a big smirk on his face. He looks down at Bill and says, ''You're not in this for the hunting are you?'''",The bear joke,0

One of the attractions is a small plane and for $10 you can go for a ride along with the pilot. Every year a man and his wife attend the carnival, and every year he asks his wife if they can go on the plane ride. She is very stubborn and responds with a quick ""No."" and the husband responds back ""Why not?"" which she responds, ""Because 10 bucks is 10 bucks"". So, year after year the husband attends the carnival and asks his wife if they can go for a plane ride. To no avail, her response stays the same, ""Because 10 bucks is 10 bucks"". The following year, the couple goes to the carnival again, and the husband asks about the plane ride once more. This time, the pilot overhears the conversation and decides to jump in. ""I have heard you two argue about this plane ride for too long. I am willing to give you both a free ride on one condition."" The husband is thrilled by this proposition and excitedly asks what it might be. ""I'll take you both in the air for free, but you have to be silent. I don't want to hear one word out of your mouth. If hear anything I will charge you the $10 it costs to ride."" Intrigued by the simple request the couple agree on the terms and head for the plane. The pilot and the couple get strapped in and he reminds them once more about their deal. The plane takes off and the husband is overjoyed. The skilled pilot begins doing barrel rolls loops and other aerobatic maneuvers. Even after all of his tricks he still hasn't heard a peep from the couple. Finally the pilot decides to land. He gets out of the plane and notices that only the husband is still in the plane. ""Sir, where's your wife!?"" he asks wildly confused. ""Oh, she fell out after the third barrel roll."" ""Well, why didn't you say anything?!"" ""Because 10 bucks is 10 bucks.""",$10 plane rides,1

""The owner of the house is responsible for my broken legs! His house is dangerous, and not suitable for habitation!"" the robber demands.

The judge responds, ""That is true- you are responsible for those injured on your property if you neglect the condition of your house. What do you have to say for yourself?""


""It is not my fault..."" the house owner replies, ""it is the fault of the roofer! He is the one who made my roof so poorly!""

Hearing this, the judge orders that the roofer be brought to court.


""You have made his roof faulty, and therefore you are responsible for this poor man's injuries!"" the judge demands.


""No, it certainly is not my fault!"" the roofer replies, ""as I was adding the finishing touches to his roof, a beautiful girl wearing a stunning dress walked by, and I could not bear to keep my eyes off of her! Therefore, I was not able to pay attention to my handiwork, and so I inevitably neglected to complete the roof!""


The judge thinks for a while, and then immediately orders the beautiful girl into the courtroom.

""You have distracted the roofer with your beautiful dresses and are guilty for the injuries of this poor man. How do you explain yourself?""

""It is not our fault that our dresses are beautiful"" the girl responds, ""it was the last one that the merchant at the corner had in stock, and he had a special deal on it, and it was just so beautiful I could not resist purchasing it!""

The judge squints menacingly, and orders the merchant into the courtroom.

""You have sold this beautiful dress to this young woman, and therefore are responsible for the injuries of this poor man. How do you explain yourself?""

""Well.."" the merchant responds, ""I did not make the dress as beautiful as it is, I purchased it from the tailor across the river. I've been selling his dresses for him for as long as I can remember!""

The judge, as he has been doing, orders the tailor to the courtroom.

""You have made this beautiful dress, and therefore are responsible for the injuries of this poor man! How could you possibly defend yourself?""

""Well... um... you see..."" the tailor replies speechlessly.

""That's it, we have found the culprit, to the cell with him!"" the judge yells as he orders his guards to haul the man off to the prison cell.

However, once they reach the cell, they notice that the tailor is so tall that he is unable to stick his head underneath the cell door, making forcing him in it impossible.

""What shall we do now?"" the guard says. ""We cannot possibly get this man into the cell!""

""I've got it!"" the judge replies, after thinking for a while.

So the judge and guards head back to the town, find a shorter tailor, and throw him into the cell instead.","As a robber was trying to enter a house through the chimney, the roof collapses and he breaks his legs.",2

The truckie says, ‘A hamburger, chips and a beer please,’ and turns to his pal. ‘I’ll have the same,’ says the emu. A short time later the waitress returns with the order. ‘That’ll be $9.40 please.’ He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day they return and the truckie orders a hamburger, chips and a beer, and the emu says, ‘I’ll have the same.’ Again the truckie reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again.
‘The usual?’ asks the waitress. ‘No, it’s Friday night, so I’ll have a steak, baked potato, salad and a martini,’ says the man. ‘Same,’ says the emu. Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, ‘That will be $32.62.’ Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress cannot contain her curiosity any longer.

‘Excuse me mate, but how do you manage to come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?’

‘Well love, a few years ago I was cleaning out the back shed when I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.’

‘That’s brilliant!’ says the waitress. ‘Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you’ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!’
‘That’s right. Whether it’s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount is always there.’

The waitress asks him, ‘So what’s with the bloody emu?’

The truckie sighs, pauses and answers, ‘My second wish was for a tall bird with a big arse and long legs who agrees with everything I say.’",An Aussie truck driver walks into an outback cafe with a full grown emu.,175

Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race. 

On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. The North Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat. 

A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the North American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, North American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion. 

They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. 

To prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team’s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. 

It was called the""Rowing Team Quality First Program“, with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses. 

The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the North American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year’s racing team was outsourced to India.",So a Japanese company and a North American company decided to have a canoe race...,1581

However, I will grant you one more chance at life, but each with one condition. If these rules are broken, you will return straight to hell."" 


The three men grew excited and quickly agreed to these terms. ""So be it."" said Satan. Satan then pointed to the fat man, ""You, gluttonous one, can never eat an unhealthy food again. Agreed?"" ""Agreed."" The fat man said sadly. He then disappeared. ""You!"" Satan bellowed at the rich man, ""can never touch another dime, nor dollar or any other currency."" ""Agreed."" said the rich man, a tear in his eye. He too disappeared. ""Finally,"" said Satan to the gay man. ""you can never touch another man in a sexual manner."" ""Fine!""

Back on Earth the three men were elated at being given a second chance. They decided to remain together and be sure to keep each other out of trouble.

The fat man, on a diet of vegetables and tofu salad, licked his lips at the sight of a young boys chili cheese dog and ripped it from the boy's hands!

All men respond with their full names.

""Okay then... What? That's odd... None of you are on the list! This is the second mixup this week!

""I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, let me ask God what I should do.""

After a few minutes of Peter seemingly talking to God telepathically, he turns to the men and says, ""Um... God's a bit mad about the mix ups, so he forced me to...

One man pipes up and says, ""Forced you to what?""

Saint Peter sighs, ""We have to play Cloud Roulette...""

Suddenly, the men are transported to what looks like a platform in the sky, where a bunch of brown clouds appear below

Saint Peter mumbles, ""The rules are simple, jump off the platform and land on a cloud.""

""...That's it?""

""...Sadly no... If you land on a brown cloud, you must marry the ugliest single lady on Earth... But you land on the golden cloud near the bottom, you get to marry the most beautiful single woman on Earth... So yay...""

One man, confident is skills, decides to jump first. He runs, jumps off the platform, and immediately lands on a brown cloud. He poofs away, sure to marry the Ugliest Single Lady on Earth.

The next man up is nervous, but reassures himself that the second ugliest single woman won't be that bad. So, he jumps, and actually  nearly makes it to the golden cloud, but accidentally touches a brown cloud. So he poofs away to meet his fate.

The final man left, not really caring of the outcome, turns around backwards, and luckily, or maybe miraculously, lands on the golden cloud.

The man wakes up in a hospital bed, forgetting his experience in heaven. He looks around, and on the other bed lies the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.

Wanting to start a conversation, he asks, ""So... What happened to you?""

""Oh, me? I was driving my car when suddenly a deranged lunatic ran a red light! Luckily I survived, but I swear, when I was unconscious, I swore I had a weird dream that had to do with landing on a brown cloud...""
