The project took months, years to finish, but at last, they succeeded. They produced a piece of extremely thin wire. It was so thin that they could not even measure how thin it actually was. Not only that, but it was also durable. They could not cut or shorten it, no matter how hard they tried.

The Swiss Government was very proud of what their engineers created, but before they would go on and show off their newest development, they wanted to know how thin it actually was. They would look like fools if they could not even tell how thin their wire was, right? After some discussion, they decided that they had to ask a fellow European country for help.

Should they ask the Germans? They are well known for their great engineering, they sure could help out. But they also liked to brag about that, so if they knew that the Swiss could not even measure it they would surely make fun of them. No, not the Germans. They decided to ask their French neighbours for help.

So they prepared a package, and added a note. ""Dear French Engineers. We have created a thin, durable wire. We can't cut it, and we can't measure how thin it is. Can you help?"". A week passed, two weeks, a month until they heard back. The French sent back the wire with a note of their own. ""We are very sorry. We tried everything, but we could neither cut it nor measure it.""

Damn, but it was worth a try. After more discussions, they decided to ask the USA next. After all they sent people to the moon and made many great inventions. They sure will find a way to help them out. They packed it, added the note, and send it over. A week passed, a month, two months until they heard back. Again, the wire was sent back to them with a note. ""We have no idea what to do. We tried everything, but we can't cut it. And our instruments are not precise enough to measure how thin it even is. We have to pass.""

There was no other way. Swiss had to ask the Germans. But they hated it that, in the end, they had to admit it to them, of all people, that they could not measure the wire. So, angrily, they threw the wire in the box, didn't even bother to add a note, taped the package and send it to Germany.

Two days later the wire gets returned. In the box is a note by the Germans. ""We didn't know what you want us to do with it, so we drilled a hole through it and did some pipe threading"".

Seven had been seeing Six about his trauma for years and in all his years of therapy had never encountered such a severe case of PTSD. He tried to get Six to go back to those moments so he could confront and overcome them but many sessions would end with Six screaming in the fetal position on the couch.

post,4nefca,2qh72,jokes,false,1465528108,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4nefca/love_begets_fortune/,self.jokes,,"A couple cursed with erratic work schedules and a long distance relationship finally found an opportunity to take a vacation together.


For their long desired vacation, they decided to visit the old capital by the coast. It was once the jewel of a sovereign kingdom alone, but due to an increase in overseas tourism, it is now an international culture center ruled by a plethora of performers and artists alike.


However, the couple had been working for so long that they did not realize travel fares and passage tolls to the old capital had drastically increased. By the time they reached the city, they were already completely out of money. Holding on to hope as dearly as they held each other's hearts, they sat down by a river to think of a plan. Surely a shortage of money would not suffice to spoil their long awaited vacation.


Watching passing troupes perform their trade, the wife comments, ""Dear, it seems making money here will be difficult. As our talentless selves, how could we ever hope to compete with the brilliance that we came here to witness?""


The husband let out a short sigh. Turning his gaze toward an artist painting the river landscape, he ponders, ""Lest we waste our time with trivial tasks for a paltry sum, we'd better think of something. I'm so sorry, I should have better prepared for our precious time together.""


""Do not fret, dear. None of this is your fault. We're blessed to even have this time together,"" the wife sullenly reassures her love.


With a bolt of inspiration striking him directly, the husband suddenly stands up. He exclaims with thunderous resolve, ""I've got it! I know of the perfect performance that only we can give to rival even the greatest spectacles gathered here today!""


After explaining his idea to his wife, she wholeheartedly agrees. Together, they set off to prepare for their act. By the goodwill of other performers, the couple manages to scrape up the necessary props. Now comes nightfall of their first day. Despite the chilling winds and dim light held only by scattered flames, the couple has no problems gathering an audience from the bustling old capital.


Blindfolded, the husband greets the audience with a bow. Smiling, the wife curtsies in suit. In the midst of her gesture, the husband strikes an exaggerated pose, pulling a knife in each hand. Initially, this prompts scattered laughter to emerge from the audience. However, their chuckles are cut short when the husband chucks the knives toward his wife. 


""Have you gone mad?!"" shouts a man. Indeed, it looked that way to many trained performers. His wife hadn't even finished taking her bow yet, and so starting the performance early is a dangerous feat.


Despite the worried jeers, the bombardment carries on. The wife moves not a muscle as her husband performs again with a knife in each hand, then two, then four, and even eight. As the last set of blades whizzed by her gentle smile, she breaks out into a modest dance. The knives did not end here -- starting again with one in each hand, then two, then four, and eight. Through the treacherous rain, the wife manages to twirl and weave through, with nary a scratch.


Whether it be by fear, bemusement, or amazement, the audience soon became thoroughly entranced. 


Signaling the end of her dance with a hard step, the husband throws all of his remaining daggers into the air, arcing towards the love of his life. The couple once again faces the stage and takes a bow, with silence cut only by the thick thud of each landing blade.


With a momentary pause, the audience begins to erupt into an applause. Many with mouth agape, they can't believe what they had just witnessed. 


""Wait!"" a shrill voice cries. A young boy at the front points out the actions of the wife. As spectators fall into horror yet again, the wife finishes tying her blindfold, still warm from the efforts of her loved one. The warmth of the band is overshadowed by the searing flames flickering just above her hands. A blazing hand-and-a-half sword unsheathed, a novice stance, and an unarmored husband stand on the stage. 


A single step from the man signals the beginning of his wife's onslaught. She charges at him, flailing the weapon every which way. The husband fearlessly continues to stand in her way, going so far as to place himself in the trajectory of her swings. The light scent of embers permeate the plaza.


As if by foresight, the woman somehow manages to avoid slaying her husband, beautifully dancing just as she was previously, but now even more dangerously. Now convinced that the husband and wife are no amateurs, the crowd overcomes anxiety and begins to cheer. Flourishing wildly, the flames reach out to savor the flesh of the husband, to no avail.


Finally, the wife hurls the sword at her husband to free her hands. With a quick draw of two matchlock pistols, she fires at eye-level. The lead bullets barely fail to graze her husband's ears as he extinguishes the blade. Unscathed, the couple again takes a bow, with the wife facing the wrong direction. Amidst a roar of laughter and cheering, the couple catches their breath. Bathing in coin and praise, they were acknowledged as stars freshly fallen from the night sky.


During the public banquet, several performers approach the couple to discuss the performance. Just as many were in awe as they were curious. Everyone was shocked when the couple insisted that none of it took much practice.


""How did you two manage to do it?"" inquires a man, blue still smeared across his hands. ""I noticed both of you at the river earlier today. You're both tourists, and neither of you had time to practice your routine, yes? Yet, everything was executed so perfectly. Neither of you are even slightly hurt! Pray tell us, how did you do it?""


The painter's testimony piques the interest of all nearby. The crowd falls into silence, waiting for the couple's response. With interlocking arms, entwined fingers, and closed eyes, the couple takes a moment to think of an answer. 


Finally, the wife opens her eyes and takes a breath. With her signature smile, she begins to speak.


""Well, we figured we've been apart from each other for so long, that we would always miss each other.""",Love begets Fortune,1

This went on for a while, until eventually one of the lady's customers pointed to the sign and said, ""Madame, you cannot keep your prices so low for long. These big companies can use their buying power to sell products cheaper, but a little store like yours can never compete.""

The town was small enough that it had only one traffic light that we were approaching as the light was red. But my buddy just sped right through at about 50 mph without even looking. I yelled, “Didn’t you see the red light?” and he said “It’s no big deal, my brother does it all the time”. I was a little shaken but had gotten over it by the time we loaded up the supplies and headed out. What a relief it was when I saw the light was green as we approached on the way back to the farm. Suddenly my friend jumped on the brakes in front of the green light nearly throwing me through the windshield. “Sorry ‘bout that”, he exclaimed, “My brother might have been passing through”.

post,4nc4n5,2qh72,jokes,false,1465496304,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4nc4n5/advice_from_ron_a_retired_husband/,self.jokes,,"It is
important for men to remember that, as women
grow older, it becomes harder for them to
maintain the same quality of housekeeping as
when they were younger. When you notice
this, try not to yell at them. Some are
oversensitive, and there's nothing worse than an
oversensitive woman.

My name is Ron.
Let me relate how I handled the situation
with my wife. When I retired a few years
ago, it became necessary for Carol Anne to get a
full-time job, along with her part-time job,
both for extra income and for the health
benefits that we needed. Shortly after she
started working, I noticed she was beginning to
show her age. I usually get home from the
golf club about the same time she gets home from
work.

Although she knows how hungry I am,
she almost always says she has to rest for half
an hour or so before she starts dinner. I
don't yell at her. Instead, I tell her to
take her time and just wake me when she gets
dinner on the table. I generally have
lunch in the Men's Grill at the club, so eating
out is not reasonable. I'm ready for some
home-cooked grub when I hit that door. She
used to do the dishes as soon as we finished
eating. But now it's not unusual for them
to sit on the table for several hours after
dinner.

I do what I can by diplomatically
reminding her several times each evening that
they won't clean themselves. I know she
really appreciates this, as it does seem to
motivate her to get them done before she goes to bed.

Another symptom of aging is
complaining, I think.For example, she will say
that it is difficult for her to find time to pay
the monthly bills during her lunch hour.
But, Boys, we take 'em for better or
worse, so I just smile and offer encouragement.
I tell her to stretch it out over two, or
even three days. That way, she won't have
to rush so much. I also remind her that
missing lunch completely now and then wouldn't
hurt her any (if you know what I mean). I
like to think tact is one of my strong points.

When doing simple jobs, she seems
to think she needs more rest periods. She
had to take a break when she was only
half-finished mowing the yard. I try not
to make a scene. I'm a fair man. I
tell her to fix herself a nice, big, cold glass
of freshly squeezed lemonade and just sit for a
while. And, as long as she is making one
for herself, she may as well make one for me,
too.

I know that I probably look like a
saint in the way I support my wife. I'm
not saying that showing this much consideration
is easy. Many men will find it difficult.
Some will find it impossible! Nobody knows
better than I do how frustrating women get as
they get older. However, Guys, even if you
just use a little more tact and less criticism
of your aging wife because of this article, I
will consider that writing it was well
worthwhile. After all, we are put on this
earth to help each other.



EDITOR'S NOTE:
Ron
died suddenly on January 31 of a perforated
rectum. The police report says he was
found with a Calloway extra-long 50-inch Big
Bertha Driver II golf club jammed up his rear
end, with barely 5 inches of grip showing, and a
sledge hammer laying nearby. His wife
was arrested and charged with murder.
The all-woman jury took only 10 minutes to
find her Not Guilty, accepting her defense that
Ron, somehow without looking, accidentally sat
down on his golf club.

without the tube inside. This challenged their perceived quality with the
buyers and distributors. Understanding how important the relationship with
them was, the CEO of the company assembled his top people. They decided to
hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. The
project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated,
RFP, and third-parties selected.  Six months (and $8 million) later they had
a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, and high quality. Everyone in
the project was pleased.

They solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would
sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighed less than it
should. The line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective
box, and then press another button to re-start the line. As a result of the
new package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the
factory.

With no more customer complaints, the CEO felt the $8 million was well
spent. He then reviewed the line statistics report and discovered the number
of empty boxes picked up by the scale in the first week was consistent with
projections, however, the next three weeks were zero! The estimated rate
should have been at least a dozen boxes a day. He had the engineers check
the equipment, they verified the report as accurate.

Puzzled, the CEO traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line
where the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new
$8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off
the belt and into a bin. He asked the line supervisor what that was about.


""Oh, that,"" the supervisor replied, ""Bert, the kid from maintenance, put it
there because he was tired of walking over, removing the box and re-starting
the line every time the bell rang.""

She said, ""Well, there you are.  You really need to chill out and quit taking everything so seriously! I mean, no sex since 1955!  Isn't that a little extreme?""

Buy him a drink and maybe he'll tell it to you.""

So the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round. The guy with the big orange head says, ""Yeah, I'll bet you want to know the story, huh?"" To which the man replies, ""Sure, if you don't mind.""

I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out!

""The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.'

""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible.

""The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'""

Months later, John receives another letter, this time reading:

John again takes the first bus back to his village and again finds his fellow villagers gathered and huddled in front of his father's house, crying and weeping. He says once more: ""Where is he? Take me to him at once!""

  &amp;nbsp

  The bartender asks him why he said ouch. The man replies that he steps on a nail. But that's not all. Infused with a pain-fueled lust for vengeance, the man beats the shit out of the bartender, fending off several other patrons, and smears the blood on his foot all over the bartender, including his eyes. He then nails the bartender to the counter with shards of glass and pieces of wood.

  The Bartender, due to blood being smeared in his eyes that was infected by a rusty nail, gets tetanus in his eyes and has to have them removed. The puncture wounds on his hands prevent him from moving his fingers at all, and he can barely walk without breaking down in agony due to the half-healed wounds on his feet. He wanders new york as a blind beggar, when one day, he hears the voice of the man who blinded him whimpering in pain.

  The blind man hears the man who blinded him, lying on his back in an alley. He feels blood beneath his feet. ""Help, please, I was beaten with a pool noodle by some thugs. I'm badly injured."" The blind man just smiles. ""Remember me?""  The man says he doesn't. The Blind man, as he can barely use his feet, and can't use his fingers, headbutted him until his skull cracked and his brains spilled out. Shortly after, the blind man suffers an aneurysm, kickstarted by the vicious headbutting he gave the dying man.

  Unbeknownst to the blind man, the man who was dying was Jeffrey, the man who stepped on a nail's twin brother. He was a member of 15 different charity organizations and built homes and latrines in north africa. He never got mad, was always cheery, and didn't even fight back as the thugs were beating him senseless with pool noodles.

Bill nonchalantly pulls out his phone and scrolls through his contacts seemingly forever and pushes the call button and then puts the phone on speaker.
Bill: 'Hey, Mr. President, you there bud?""
President: ""BILL! Whats going on man, its been FOREVER!""
Bill: ""Going great, im gonna have to cut you off, my manager would like to talk to you.""

Dave: Mr. President do you know Bill?
President: Hell Yeah, we go way back! He and I use to go golfing all the time before hit started to look for work outside of D.C.
Dave: Thank you for your time!
President: Thank you and both of you have a good day!

Dave: All right, that was just coincedence, surely you dont know EVERYONE.
Bill: Sure I do, I even know The Pope.
Dave: THE POPE?! Surely you are joking, I believe the President but surely not The Pope.

Bill: I cant he doesnt have a phone so the best way is to fly to him.
Dave: If you say so.
So the both get into Bill's car and drive to the airport. People along the way are waving at Bill. But as time goes on Bill and Dave are close to missing their plane. Bill makes a call and beofre they know it, a police escort gets them to the airport with time to get to their plane. At the airport Bill talks and jokes around with the TSA who gets them checked first. As they go to get their tickets Bill talk to the clerk and gets some ""spare"" tickets for first class. Dave is just sitting back, lost for words for the events that just keep transpiring one after another. The plane takes off and Dave takes some pills and sleeps for the entire flight. As they land everyone lets Bill and Dave off and a limousine awaits them outside and takes them to the Vatican. They finally arrive in the Vatican Plaza.
Dave is almost as white as a ghost.
Dave: So, where is he?
Dave is gasping for air at this point.
Bill: Are you sure you're alright?
Dave: Im fine, just prove this already!
Bill: Alright, stay here Ill get The Pope.
Bill disappears into the crowd and gets past security into The Vatican. He meets up with the Pope and they walk out onto the balcony and see an ambulance arrive in the crowd near where Dave was. Bill rushes out of the Vatican into the plaza and the ambulance drives off. He asks someone what had happened.
Bill: Excuse what happened?

How she took the house and the kids (she could have them), half his money but she couldn't touch his baby- a supped up Camaro.  He said that Camaro was about the fastest thing in the world.

The snail is getting pretty fed up and just wants some peace and quiet.  He turns to the fox and says ""I'll make you a bet.  I challenge you to a race tomorrow at noon.  If I win, You don't ever come back in here""

The fox asks what happens if he wins.

The snail replies that if the fox wins the snail will buy his beer for a year.

The fox immediately goes home and starts fine tuning the Camaro, putting on race wheels and triple checking the timing.

The snail stays at the bar drinking for another hour or so, goes home, plays with his kids for a bit, kisses his wife and right before bed he paints a big red S on the side of his old minivan.

Noon comes and the fox and the snail meet up on main street.  Now the fox has a reputation for being a jerk and a loudmouth so a ton of town folks show up to root on the snail.

As both cars pull up to the line and the fox begins to rev his engine the town begins to chant in unison.

It's a par-three, over water.  Jesus hits his tee shot and it heads for the water.  Rather than sinking, the ball skitters across the top of the water and rolls up on the green.  Moses hit his, and it too heads for the hazard.  At the last second, the water parts, allowing the ball to roll up on the green.  The old guy takes the tee, and just like his paying partners he too hits the ball in the drink.  His ball, however, slowly sinks to the bottom.  As it is sinking, a passing fish sees the ball and swallows it.  The fish then swims to the surface, where he is spied by a passing eagle.  The eagle grabs the fish and flies off.  As he flies over the green the fish somehow manages to poop the ball out, and it goes in the cup for a hole-in-one.

""Hey pal, I've left my wallet at home but hey... tell you what, if I can show you something incredible, will you give me a free beer in return?""

The bartender is a worldly individual. ""Listen mate, look around at the stuff on the walls, I've seen all kinds of things, been all kinds of places. I mean, you can give it a shot but I honestly doubt you can show me something that impressive.""

So the man reaches into his left jacket pocket and pulls out a small hamster. He places the hamster on the bar and the bartender looks bemused. The man reaches into his other jacket pocket and pulls out a tiny piano, followed by a tiny stool, just the right size for the hamster, who sits down, cracks his knuckles and starts playing a famous piece of music by Rachmaninoff.

The bartender is speechless.

""Tell you what mate... I've seen some things in my time but that is absolutely incredible! Here's your free beer.""

The visitor gulps down his drink until the last drop is gone. But he can't help but feel another drink would really hit the spot. He motions to the bartender again.

""Look, I could really use another drink - how about I show you something even more incredible?""

The bartender stares in disbelief. ""After that performance, I think you'll struggle to beat it! But go on, try your luck then.""

The man reaches into his left jacket pocket again and retrieves a small frog, who is wearing a waist coat. He places the frog on the stool beside the hamster. The hamster counts to four, the frog clears his throat, and over the piano the frog sings a classic opera, bringing several people in the bar to tears.

""Oh my word,"" says the bartender. ""That is absolutely unbelievable. Here's your pint, mate. You've earned it.""

In the corner of the room, a shady looking individual has been watching with keen interest from behind his dark sunglasses. He approaches the owner of the performing animals and gets straight to business.

""I'll give you £50,000 right now, in cash, if you'll let me take that frog off your hands this instant.""

""Well, sure, why not?"" says the man, as he duly hands the frog over to the shady character, who promptly slides back a silver briefcase filled with bank notes before making his exit with the frog.

""Are you MAD!?"" the bartender says to the man. ""You could have made millions with that frog!""

""Nah,"" says the man.

He longed to go to a wildlife reserve and experience nature up-close-and-personal. His parents, eager to instill moral values, were delighted that this was the case instead of playing violent video games. So, on his ninth birthday, Jimmy was ecstatic to hear that his parents were taking him on a safari! 

On the day before he was due to leave, Jimmy had a playdate with his friends. When their parents came to pick them up, Jimmy's mother wanted to boast about her son's hobby.

""Jimmy,"" she called, ""Come and tell your friend's mother where you're going tomorrow.""

Jimmy came running into the foyer. With a grin, he yelled, ""We're goin' on a frickin' safari!!!""

The parents, particularly Jimmy's, were horrified.

""Yeah, he's goin' on a frickin' safari!!"" his friend said to his mother, equally pleased.

'Where did you learn such language?"" one of the parents asked, to which a confused Jimmy replied, ""My parents!""

The friends were quickly escorted to their cars, with their parents scolding them. As they left, there were murmurs of ""such deplorable behavior"" and ""what awful parenting"". Jimmy's mother and father were dumbfounded. ""How could he do this?"" they asked. ""We've never said such words in our lives! Maybe we really are bad parents.""

The next day, on the flight to the preserve, Jimmy boarded the plane, eagerly singing, ""We're going on a frickin' safari!"" repeatedly. The mother and father looked at each other, and put their arms around Jimmy's shoulders. ""Listen, son,"" they said. ""Where did you really hear that word?""

""From you,"" he said, bewildered.

""Now, why would we ever say that?"" they insisted, to which their son replied, ""You told it to me on my birthday."" They sighed. ""Jimmy, look, whether we said it or not, that word is very inappropriate. We love you, and we don't want you getting in trouble.""

""Okay,"" Jimmy said. The rest of the flight was calm and quiet.

When they finally arrived, Jimmy rushed out of the plane. ""Yay!"" he exclaimed rushing toward the safari park, located near the airport. His parents ran to catch up with him, only to find on the front signpost~

he would wash his car engine. So David agrees and he opened the engine washed it and put all the pieces together. The father gave David his well deserved 50 cents and David ran back to the market stand. David asked the man how much the beautiful pink shoes costs. The man answered: 1 euro and 50 cents please. David bought the shoes full of excitement. David ran back home and walks up stairs. he closes his room door and started pulling of his shoes and socks, while the door rang. He doesn't want anyone to see his new shoes so he put on his old shoes and socks and ran to the door. David opens the door and sees a man with a black suit and a black briefcase. The man said: ""Im so sorry, but your mother has passed away in the hospital. Her sewingmachine electrocuted her. David is a bit sad but in his mind he is all about his new pair of pink shoes. He closes the door and runs back to his room as fast as he can. He started pulling his shoes and socks of again. But the door rang for the second time. David puts his shoes and socks back on and ran downstairs. He opens the door and the same man stand in front of him and he sais: 'Im so sorry, I have never seen this before but also your father as been found dead. His car exploded when he tried to start it."". David knows he did something wrong but he needs to see his new schoes in action.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified , she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no; I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish Setter's ass and a car hit us both.

I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack, he was laughing so hard!

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.

""Welcome to heaven,"" says St.. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

""No problem, just let me in,"" says the Senator.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

""Really? I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the Senator.

""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.

The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.

In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.

They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.

They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, ""Now it's time to visit heaven.”

So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.""

The Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.""

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell...

Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground.

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.

""I don't understand,"" stammers the Senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?""

The devil smiles at him and says,

""Yesterday we were campaigning,

Today, you voted..""

A cop notices how fast he is going and pulls him over. The cop says to the man, ""Are you aware of how fast you were going?"" 

The man replies, ""Yes I am. I'm trying to escape a robbery I got involved in."" 

The cop gives him a skeptical look and says, ""Were you the one being robbed?"" 

The man casually replies, ""No, I committed the robbery."" 

The cop looks shocked that the man admitted this. ""So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"" 

""Yes,"" the man calmly says. ""I have the loot in the back."" 

The cop begins to get angry. ""Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me."" The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man. 

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says. 

The cop calls for backup. Soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. The man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. However, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""Sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However, we found none of these things in your car.""

The king of this little land faces a lot of difficulty. He wants to make his kingdom into a sovereign nation but unfortunately they do not have the infrastructure, population, or economy to do so. In fact, this small state is only known for a single export. Thanks to their proximity to some of the finest gold and other metals in the world but total lack of an ability to process those metals on a mass scale, they have been left with only one option. You know the saying; when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Make lemonade they did. This tiny territory is renowned for creating the highest quality watches in the world. No expense is spared and their elite group of craftsmen train for their entire lives from childhood to produce these terrific timepieces. Men of great wealth and taste have been known to trade entire fortunes for just a single one of these watches; that is how valuable they are.

The king knows this and he knows that only a small portion of his populace can ever hope to become one of the respected elite, let alone hold one of their masterpieces in their own hands. Being a very just and fair man, the king ordered the most senior watchmaker in the land to create something the likes of which had never been seen. A watch of such great craftsmanship so as to be above monetary value. The man labored long and hard for many nights to produce the king's watch. When he at last presented the completed work to his lord - in front of the entire nation, no less - he was met with thunderous applause and a warm embrace. He had done it! The king then made a shocking announcement.

""This masterpiece belongs to my people!""

When the roaring of the crowd died down he continued.

""This watch shall be a symbol of my love for all of you. Though I rule over you with supreme authority I do not wish a single one of you to feel that you do not have a voice in the ruling of this nation. From this day on let anyone who doubts my decisions or questions my judgment wear this watch and stand as my equal to voice their concerns. Should even a single one of you think me unfair or wrong in any matter then simply come to my castle and I will present you this token of good faith.""

The king made good on his word and from that day on all citizens knew they held the right to challenge their king's rulings. Over time the watch became a symbol of fairness throughout the land. Anyone who wore it could speak plainly to their ruler.

It was the ""don't believe me just"" watch.",There's a little known country in central Europe that is ruled by a monarchy... (x-post /r/dadjokes),8

The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.

You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.
So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the ""greatest con ever botched,"" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the *""condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending"" con.*

The driver, obviously confused, says to him, “Officer, I don’t understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?”


“Ma’am,” the officer replies, “You weren’t speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.”


“Slower than the speed limit?” she asked. No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!” the old woman says a bit proudly. The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that “22” was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.

The lifeguard, though confused as to why the man would want it, complies with his request.

 A few minutes later, the lifeguard sees the man squeezing the lemon wedge over the pool. Within a minute, a kid jumps into the water and starts to drown. The lifeguard dives into the water to save his life, but the child is unconscious and so is taken to the hospital. She considers closing the pool, but decides the incident was a fluke and continues business as usual. 

A couple hours later, the same man approaches the lifeguard and once again asks for her lemon wedge. Despite being slightly creeped out, she decides to give it to him. The man immediately walks to the other side of the pool and squeezes the lemon wedge over it again. As before, a child nearly drowns and is sent to the hospital.The lifeguard makes the call not to close the pool, but becomes highly suspicious of the man.

After an hour of deliberation, she decides to catch him red handed. She puts three lemon wedges in her drink and waits. Sure enough, the man waltzes over and asks for a lemon wedge. ""Just one? Don't you want all of them?"" the lifeguard asks, and the man replies ""Nah. I only need a tiny amount of juice to make the kids think that the bottom of the pool smells like lemons!""

“But officer,” replied the second blonde, “we aren’t fishing. We all have magnets at the end of our lines and we’re collecting debris off the bottom of the river.”
The Game Warden lifted up all the lines and, sure enough, there were horseshoe magnets tied on the end of each line.
“Well, I know of no law against it,” said the Game Warden. “Take all the debris you want. And with that, he left.

I can't make this up, she was like a 9/10; seriously gorgeous with blonde hair and these stunning blue eyes. I felt bad for her, really, cause she was carrying all of this heavy stuff on her own. In my head, and I don't know what I was thinking considering I'm like a 6/10 at my best, I decided I'd at least try to give her a hand. I went over to her, said ""Hey, I noticed you don't have any help. You need someone else to move these boxes inside?""

She looks me straight in the face with this disgusting glare and says. ""Yeah, I'm good, thanks."" I'm not sure what I was expecting, but that even shocked me a little bit. Contrary to my own nature, I just told her that if she needed help after all she could just come knock on my door. She went through with the move by herself and I didn't hear from her for a couple days.

That is until I hear a knock at my door. When I open up to see who it is, sure enough, it's 9/10 girl right there, and apparently she wants to talk to me. She says ""I'm really sorry about how bitchy I was back when you tried to help me. Let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner."" Woah. After all that, she actually comes to ME for a date. So I counteroffer, tell her that we should also go watch a movie in return for me paying for the dinner, and she goes along with it just fine.

We got together and things were going GREAT! Maybe we weren't very compatible, cause I'm into anime and video games but while she was into Starbucks and Mean Girls and white girl shit like that. Still, our relationship had this weird formula... It just worked, somehow, and it worked incredibly well.

A month after we started dating, I noticed another moving truck, this time at the house across the street from me. Once again, I noticed a girl moving in. Now, this girl isn't as hot as my girlfriend. If I had to rate her, I'd give her a 7/10. Still, she was on her own, and chivalrous me went to go offer help again.

She was VERY open to getting help, and instantly handed me a box that was heavy as all hell. I felt like Atlas carrying the Earth, that's how heavy it was. But when I realized the box said ""Video Games"" on it, I knew I was in for some shit. Opened it up, saw a bunch of SERIOUS fucking video games in there, not any stupid 'girl gamer' nonsense. I'm talking NES cartridges, PC games, two entire consoles, controllers. I asked her ""Is this your boyfriend's stuff?"" and just as quickly as she had accepted my help, she told me she didn't have a boyfriend and it was all hers.

Anyway, I helped her moving everything else out of the van and almost immediately after we just hung out at her house. It was fun as hell, man. Hadn't felt that I had a good friend like that for a long time. Couple weeks go by and my girlfriend starts to notice how much me and this new girl have been hanging out. My girlfriend came up to me and said, ""Sorry, I have problems with jealousy and I just don't really want you hanging out with her. You're spending a lot of time with her and I want you to spend more time with me.""

Hearing this from her was UNBELIEVABLE. A girl this fucking beautiful getting jealous over something I did! Either way, I told her that because me and the other girl were so similar that they would definitely like each other. She agrees, although reluctantly, and comes back to me later.

She says ""Yeah, you can't see her anymore. She told me that if she ever sees me and you together she will fucking murder me and that you belong to her."" I was in disbelief because it doesn't even match her personality to say something like that, but I insisted that there was no way it was real, and yet she continued to push it, and for some reason she sounded really convincing. ""That's literally what she said, she said she'll fucking kill me!""

""I can't imagine it's that serious."" I said, ""Let me go and talk to her so I can figure this out.""

I went to the house of the 7/10 girl and knocked on the door. No response. Waited, called her, no answer. Okay, fine. Called my girlfriend to tell her I'll try to get in contact tomorrow, no answer. Go to my girlfriend's house, knock on the door, and again there is no answer. This goes on for a couple weeks with no luck, and I'm left clueless as to what is going on. I file missing persons reports for both of them, neither of them get found.

I'm only left guessing. Did they run away together? Is this some horrible coincidence? I didn't know, and at the time it seemed as if I had no way of knowing.

I give up hoping.

But one day, I turned on the news and couldn't believe my eyes. I witnessed footage of 7/10 girl getting taken away in handcuffs, soaked completely in blood. She's raging at the cameras, yelling at me about how she's gonna come and kill me next.

Autopsy reports come out, and it becomes apparent that not only did the 7/10 girl murder my girlfriend like she said she would, but that parts of my girlfriend's body were missing. It appears that chunks of flesh from her body were ingested by none other than the killer herself.

I mourned for my beautiful girlfriend for some time, but then I reflected on the footage I watched on the news. I knew that she was coming for me, and I couldn't run for long. I locked myself in my home, covering windows and reinforcing them, putting multiple locks on every entrance I could just to keep her out. I broke down, crying myself to sleep at night, screaming at walls, becoming a paranoid mess as my sanity slipped away, until one day, I realized...

I realized the point of it all. It dawned on me, finally, the purpose of my entire experience, and in my fits of madness and screaming, my moment of sudden realization, I screamed...
