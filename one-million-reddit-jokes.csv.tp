The crowd cheers, and he receives the first of his free drinks.

agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part shall be removed  
from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed

the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating  
at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of  
the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the  
second part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the  
parties.  
        The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be  
limited to, the following.  The party of the first part shall, with or without  
elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other  
means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate the party  
of the second part in a counter-clockwise direction, this point being tendered  
non-negotiable.  Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part  
becomes fully detached from the receptacle, the party of the first part shall  
have the option of disposing of the party of the second part in a manner  
consistent with all relevant and applicable local, state and federal statutes.  
Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part  
shall have the option of beginning installation.  Aforesaid installation shall  
occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in  
step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation  
should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable.  
The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the  
first part, by any or all agents authorized by him, the objective being to  
produce the most possible revenue for the Partnership.

A woman standing near the tee said, ""Hey, I like to golf, can I join the group?""

They were hesitant but said she could come once to try it. She said ""Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or quarter to seven.""

She showed up right at 6:30, and wound up setting a course record with a 7-under-par round. The guys went nuts and everyone in the clubhouse congratulated her. Meanwhile, she was fun and pleasant the entire round. The guys happily invited her back the next week and she said ""Sure, I'll be here at 6:30 or quarter to 7.""

Again, she showed up at 6:30 Sunday morning. Only this time, she played left-handed, and matched her 7-under par score of the previous week. By now the guys were totally amazed, and they asked her to join the group for keeps.

They had a beer after their round, and one of the guys asked her, ""how do you know if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

She said ""That's easy. Before I leave for the golf course, I pull the covers off my husband, who sleeps in the nude. If his member is pointing to the right, I golf right-handed; if it's pointed to the left, I golf left-handed.""

They call out to him and ask what it is.  He replies that he cannot say but they persist.  After agreeing to show the contents of the bag in return for free golf, the man reveals that it is a sniper rifle!  Taken aback the three men ask why he has a gun in his bag.  The man responds: ""because I am an assassin for hire and I always have to be ready""  

All the men were amazed and the owner of the golf course said: "" See that big house over there?  Look into the window and tell me what you see""

The assassin gets his gun out and aims towards the house but is silent.  The owner of the house says: "" well, what is it?""

Assassin responds: ""You aren't going to like it, your wife is there with another man and it looks like they are undressing""

He thinks this over and decides that it will work. With his wife holding open the barn door he lines up with the hole and gives the ball a terrific ""Whack""! The ball shoots through the air and right into the head of his wife, killing her instantly. 

Months go by, the man mourning all the while. His friends, hating to see him in such a state, convince him to go golfing with them. They end up at the same course and on the final hole, oddly enough, another terrible slice puts the old barn between his ball and the green. The man is about to punch his ball back to the fairway so he can have a clear shot at the green when his friend makes a suggestion. ""What if I were to hold open the barn doors? That way you could send it right through the barn onto the green."" 

The man replies, ""No. I already tried that once and it ended up horribly.""

""What happened?,"" his friend asked.

""I got a double bogey on this hole.""


&gt;A man and his buddies are about to tee off on the first hole, which happens to be near a street, when a funeral procession starts to drive by. The man steps back from his address, takes off his hat, puts it across his heart and watches silently as every car drives by and out of sight.

&gt;One of his buddies, truly inspired, remarked, ""Wow that was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.""

&gt;The man started to address the ball again before saying, ""It was the least I could do. We were married for 35 years after all.""

Later at the hospital, the doctor talks to the man about his wife's status. ""She's in stable condition for now. The swelling in her brain has stopped, and it looks like she will make a full recovery. However, upon her physical examination, we were surprised to find a golf ball in your wife's rectum. Do you have any idea how that may have gotten there?""

""Oh!"" says the husband, ""That was my mulligan""


&gt;A man staggers into an emergency room with a concussion, multiple bruises, two black eyes, and a five iron wrapped tightly around his throat. Naturally, the doctor asks him what happened.

&gt;“Well, it was like this,” said the man. “I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife, when at a difficult hole, we both sliced our balls into a pasture of cows.”

&gt;“We went to look for them and while I was rooting around, I noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end.

&gt;""I walked over and lifted up the tail, and sure enough, there was the golf ball with my wife’s monogram on it, stuck right in the middle of the cow’s butt. That’s when I made my mistake.”

&gt;“What did you do?” asks the doctor.

&gt;He said, ""I'm off to change a light bulb.""

&gt;Well I just cracked up, couldn't stop laughing, then said,
""That's gonna be a bit awkward init?""
&gt;
&gt;""Not really."" he said. ""I still have the receipt, you insensitive bastard.""

Is Charlie slang for something? Is the joke that it's hard to change a lightbulb with one arm? Why did Charlie buy a lightbulb if he's planning to return it? Why is it insensitive to laugh about his lightbulb?

Bartender looks over, got a real sad look on his face.  Got some real sympathy wellin' up in his eyes, y'know.  So he turns, he says, ""HEY!  Buddy.  Yeah, you.""


Fraction looks over at this point - he's thinkin' what now?  Can't have a beer in peace, sheesh.  Who is this guy anyway?  So he's all, ""YEAH?  You got somethin' to say to me, pal?  You wanna do this???  We can get fresh together - we can get Jared jackin' off juniors, 'SUBWAY' sweet onion teriyaki fresh.  Bring that mouth over here and see what happens tough guy.""


Bartender, he's floored.  He's floored, but he ain't gonna let that get to 'em.  Looks that unreduced fraction dead in his freakin' eyes and you know what he says?


""Hey buddy...  Why the long expression?""


Fraction don't like this none too much, starts gettin' up in the bartender's face and he's all, ""I can EXPRESS myself however I want, and  I don't need YOU or nobody else to gimme no stinkin' lip about it.""


Oh jeez now the bartender, he's about had it, starts comin' in with,


""Whoa, whoa, whoa... you can't be doin' this!  This is a bar for Christ's sake!  You're sittin' here with your 'tree over your two, talkin' a big mess about expression.  It ain't proper, pal.  You know what in fact it's IMPROPER what you're doin' right now.  That's what it is.""


Now get this, the fraction...?  He starts BREAKIN' down, man.  You had to see this - he's just fallin' all over the place, cryin' and shit.  Just bitch-sobbin' all about ""I ain't got no balance no more!  I'm all mixed up!!""  Oh man, that bartender had reduced him down to just about nothin'.  


But he feels bad, y'know!  He don't want no part of this numerical molestation.  Starts consoling the poor guy.  'Bout five minutes later, I be damned if he didn't start lookin' like a million bucks.  Gave him whatever he needed to feel whole again, seemed like. 


Then - get this - I'm turned away a second, turn back and they're arguin' again!  Apparently, after ""feelin' whole"" again as he kept sayin, he starts gettin' nasty with the bartender - just real fuckin' negative, I heard.  Bartender presses him, goin' for the root of the issue - you know, try and figure all this out.  And that's when he really lost it.  He starts tossin' stools, breakin' mugs - you name it.  Bartender finally pipes up,


""YOU gotta get outta here, buddy!!  I don't need this kinda irrational nonsense messin' up my bar.""


After that, dude just kinda sat there goin' on forever.  Not repeatin' nothin', just goin' on and on.  Door guy kicked him out couple minutes later.  Irrational, just like the bartender said.  That's how I'd put it anyway.",Part of the Joke,0

""John,"" she said, (firm loose breasts undulating beneath her white silky robe) ""forget your troubles. Come to my villa, rest a while and I'll help you get the cart up later."" 

""That's mighty nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife would like it."" 

""Oh, come on now,"" Elizabeth insisted.  

She was so very pretty, very very sexy and very persuasive ... I was weak. ""Well okay,"" I finally agreed but thought to myself, ""my wife won't like it."" 

After a couple of restorative Scotch and waters, I thanked Elizabeth. ""I feel a lot better now, but I know my wife is going to be really upset. So I'd best go now.""

They were walking away from a plane crash, uninjured, when they were captured by a cannibalistic indigenous tribe of indians.
Taking the 3 men to the tribe's village, they were told by the only english speaking man that they were to be eaten, skinned and have their bones used for paddles and skin for their canoes. The english speaking villager then said "" As is our custom, all of our prisoners are allowed one request before death other then freedom"".

Looking at each man as they pondered, he goes to the white man and and asks what is his final request.  The white man looks at him and says it has been a long time since I had a woman. The villager brings out 3 young women from the tribe and they take him to the nearest hut to have sex.

The villager then turns to the black man and asks what would his final request be.  The black ponders and starts crying as he is asking if he could write one letter to his family before he died to tell them he loves them. The villager nods and tells him the village will send the letter to a neighboring town that has postal access. 

As the black man walks to the hut to write his good byes, the villager turns to the puerto rican and asks him what his final request is. The man ponders for a bit and asks for a fork and to see his friends one last time. The villager is confused and asks if he is sure. The villager tells him we have women drugs and alcohol. The man tells him ""Just a fork""

The men are rounded up finally and as the english speaking villager walks away after giving the fork to the puerto rican.  The puerto rican grips his fork and starts stabbing the shit out the black guy and the white guy, and finally himself all while shouting fuck this boat, fuck that boat, and fuck this boat.

As the gentleman had an extremely rare type of blood that couldn't be foundlocally, the call went out around the world.

Finally a Scotsman was located who had the same rare blood type. After some coaxing, the Scot donated his blood for the Arab.

After the surgery the Arab sent the Scotsman a new BMW, a diamond necklace for his wife, and $100,000 in appreciation for the blood donation.

A few months later, the Arab had to undergo a corrective surgery procedure.

Once again, his doctor telephoned the Scotsman who this time was more than happy to donate his blood.

After the second surgery, the Arab sent the Scotsman a thank-you card and a box of chocolates. The Scotsman was shocked that the Arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had anticipated.

He then phoned the Arab and asked him: ""I thought you would be more generous than that. Last time you sent me a BMW, diamonds and money, but this time you only sent me a lousy thank-you card and a crappy box of chocolates?"" 

To this the Arab replied: ""Aye, laddie, but I now have Scottish blood in me veins.""",A Scottish joke,852

So he decides to buy her a toy in the hopes of keeping her satisfied until he gets back. He goes to the neighborhood sex shop and explains his situation the the store owner. The owner groans with understanding and steps into the back room, and come back with a black box tied with a black bow. He explains to the man that this is the voodoo dick, a cursed dildo that will fuck anything you tell it to mercilessly. He explains that you just call out to the dildo by its name ""Voodoo Dick"" and tell it what to fuck. The man scoffs and laughs at the store owner. The store owner smiles and simply says ""Voodoo dick, doorknob"". The bow slid itself undone, and the lip came off the box as a black dildo hovered out of the box for a moment and launched itself at the doorknob of the front door. It the proceeded to plow the doorknob through the door. As the man stood slack jawed the store owner said ""Voodoo Dick, return"" and the dildo went back into its box, and the owner asked if that would be cash or charge?

As the man was leaving for his trip he presented the black box to this wife and told her that this toy would satisfy her until he was able to get home and told her to just call it by name, tell it what to fuck, and she would not be disappointing. Within a day the wife was itching to feel a cock inside her and pulled out the black box. She giggled at the thought but commanded ""Voodoo Dick, my pussy"" Much to her amazement the dildo rose out of the box and plunged itself deep into her. Within a minute she was curling her toes and spasming with sheer ecstasy. Instantly in love, she shouts Yes, Yes, just like that! The voodoo dick keeps going and before she knows it she is having multiple orgasms, one after another. After about an hour she decides to take a rest, but as she goes to pull the Voodoo Dick out of her, it pulled against her. Easily overpowering her, and continuing to fuck her hard and deep. She realizes that she doesn't know how to make it stop, and before long panic starts setting in. She decides she has to get to the hospital for help. She makes her way out of the house and into her car stopping every few steps in the midst of a body shaking orgasm. She gets on the road and makes her way towards the hospital shivering every second. It is not long before A police officer sees her swerving on the road and quickly pulls her over. As he approaches the car he finds a panicked and moaning woman gasping between moans that a magic voodoo dick her husband got her won't stoop fucking her. The cop laughs and says ""Voodoo Dick, my ass!""",NSFW The Voodoo Dick.,32

 ""So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.""
 ""I see it perfectly."" 
""What you don't see,"" said Arthur, ""because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.""
 ""What's he look like?""
 ""Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"" said Arthur, ""as if he was about to do anything weird.""
 ""Ah. I know the type. What did he do?""
 ""He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and..."" 
""What?"" 
""Ate it."" 
""What?"" 
""He ate it.""
 Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment.
 ""What on earth did you do?""
 ""Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,"" said Arthur, ""to ignore it.""
 ""What? Why?""
 ""Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits."" ""Well, you could..."" 

Fenchurch thought about it. ""I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?"" ""I stared furiously at the crossword,"" said Arthur. ""Couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,"" he added, ""that the packet was already mysteriously open..."" ""But you're fighting back, taking a tough line."" ""After my fashion, yes. I ate a biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,"" Arthur said, ""it stays eaten."" 
""So what did he do?""
 ""Took another one. Honestly,"" insisted Arthur, ""this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.""
 Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 
""And the problem was,"" said Arthur, ""that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject a second time around. What do you say? ""Excuse me...I couldn't help noticing, er..."" Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.""
 ""My man..."" 
""Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day...""
 ""What?""
 ""I went into the breach again. I took,"" said Arthur, ""another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.""
 ""Like this?""
 ""Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"" said Arthur, ""that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time."" ""I can imagine."" ""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me..."" ""The whole packet?"" ""Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.""
 ""Gladiators,"" said Fenchurch, ""would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling."" ""There is that.
 So. When the empty packet was lying between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper...""

 ""Yes?""

 ""Were my biscuits.""
 ""What?"" said Fenchurch.
 ""What?"" 
""True."" ""No!"" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing. She sat up again.

 ""You complete nitwit,"" she hooted, ""you almost completely and utterly foolish person.""","An excerpt from ""So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish"" (Adams Chp20). A brief story about biscuits.",1

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?""
The young man replies, ""A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!""
""Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,"" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. ""Why does it cost so much?""
""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the banker proudly.
The moped driver asks, ""Mind if I take a look inside?""
""No problem,"" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!""
Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!
""What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?"" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!
He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!
The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, ""Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?""

""Hello young gentleman, so rare to see anyone in these sticks, what brings you around?""

Being lost for nearly 12 hours he tells her that they're lost and hungry, he wants food for him and his buddy. Stunned at his story the lady invites him inside but only him, she says ""I don't trust both of you enough to let you simultaneously inside my home"". The boy goes up to his friend and tells him ""wait for me outside maybe she's intimidated by two men""

Once inside the lady closes the door, opens the window near the candle, sits down on her chair and tells the boy

""You see young man, I haven't slept with anyone in ages, now I know you wouldn't want to fuck an old rag like me but I've always wanted to feel the cool summer breeze as someone had fun with me, so take that bag of corn over there and fuck me with all of them, then I'll make a roast and bread for you and your friend""

Confused and grossed out, the boy so hungry, decided to do it anyways. 

He goes on with one corn, second corn, third corn, all up to thirty-six corns. All throwing them out the window as he goes. The lady full of sweat, huge smile on her face thanks him 

""Come now, get your friend inside, I'll make you that food now""

The first boy storms outside while gagging, yells to his friend to get the fuck inside and to come eat. The second boy sitting down holding his stomach looks at him and says.

post,4dcu5p,2qh72,jokes,false,1459800132,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4dcu5p/the_man_test/,self.jokes,," THE MAN TEST

 1. If you are over forty, and you have a washboard stomach, you are a 
 queer.
 It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and have spent
 the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah
 diet...Faggot.

 2. If you have a cat, you are a homo. A cat is like a dog, but queer-- it
 grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch
 except when it uses its claws, and whines to be fed. And just think about
 how you call a dog..... 'Killer, come here! I said get your ass over here,
 Killer!' Now think about how you call a cat...'Bun-bun, come to daddy,
 snookums! Jeeez, you're so queer.

 3. If you suck on lollipops, Ring-Pops, or any such nonsense, rest 
 assured,
 you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks on BBQ ribs, crab claws, raw
 oysters, lobster backs, pickled pigs feet, or tits. Anything else and you
 are a Homo in training and undeniably a fag.

 4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking
 lot, you crave a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his 
 toilet;
 he defecates and urinates where he pleases.

 5. If you drink anything other than regular coffee, you're as fairy as
 Tinkerbelle. A straight man will never be heard ordering a 'Decaf Soy
 Latte'. If you've put a Decaf Soy Latte to your lips, you've had a man 
 there
 too..

 6. If you know more than six names of non-standard colors or four 
 different
 types of dessert other than ice cream and custard, you might as well be
 handing out free ass passes. A real man doesn't have memory space in his
 brain to remember all of that crap. If you can pick out chartreuse you're
 gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than cotton or denim, 
 you
 are a peter puffer.

 7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it, you're dying to
 tune a meat whistle. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at a
 slow-assed driver or to cut the prick off. The rest of the time he needs
 that hand to change the radio station, eat a hamburger, or hold his beer.

 8. If you do not send this off to all the males on your email list because
 you are afraid of hurting their feelings then you are definitely on the
 verge of being a salami smuggler.
