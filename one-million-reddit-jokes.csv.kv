Husband says to his wife that he is going golfing. She gets upset because she thought they would spend the day together. 

Husband: ""honey just give me the day I need to relieve some stress. Besides You don't even golf.""

Wife: ""I want to learn and besides it's something we can do together.""

The husband begrudgingly accepts his wife request they go to the gold course. On the first tee the husband drives it 300 yards, dead center. The wife tries it and slices it right into a huge window of a huge house on the side of the course. 

Husband says ""ah shit. Ok let's go pay for this window

The couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. A very well dressed man answers the door, ""Yeees..?"" 

Husband: ""Hi we're the ones that broke the window, are you the owner of the house?""

Well dressed man: ""oh no I am only the butler. Master is on the other room, follow me. 

The couple follows the butler through the massive entry and into a wondrous library. In the center of which sits the master, staying intently at a vase that was broken, quite clearly by the golf ball.

Husband: ""oh I am so sorry. My wife, you see, is learning golf. She didnt mean to..""

The master interrupts in an understanding tone ""haha oh its alright. You see I'm a genie and I was trapped in that case for the last several hundred years. But you released me by breaking it. As you know genies grant 3 wishes. But since you did break the window I will save the third for myself, leave 1 each for you both. Madame would you like to go first?""

Wife: ""uh I want lots of money....""

""Done."" Interrupts the master, "" I'll also make it theft proof, fire proof, and infinite. Anytime you need money no matter the amount, it will be in your account.""

Wife: ""oh my goodness thank you so much!""

""You're turn"", says the the master looking at the husband.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake.",53

The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.

You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.

So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the ""greatest con ever botched,"" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the ""condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending"" con.",A swindler Passes by a bird in the stairwell of an appartment building,15

post,7to9vw,2qh72,jokes,false,1517184261,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7to9vw/two_minute_management_course/,self.jokes,,"Lesson One ...

An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.

A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and do nothing?""

The eagle answered: ""Sure, why not.""

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit, and ate it.

Management Lesson - To be sitting doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.

Lesson Two ...

A turkey was chatting with a bull. ""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, ""but I haven't got the energy.""

""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients.""

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.

He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.

Management Lesson - Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.

Lesson Three ...

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold; the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field.

While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realise how warm he was.

The dung was actually thawing him out!

He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

Management Lessons - 
(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.
(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
(3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!

This ends your two-minute 
Management course ...",Two Minute Management Course,422

So the first guy comes back with a peach. The native american says ""Shove it up your ass, if you laugh we kill you."" So, he shoves the peach up his ass and he laughs, and the native americans kill him. The second guy comes back with a grape. The native american tells him the same thing. He laughs and the native american kills him. They both see eachother in heaven and the first guy says to the second guy, ""I had a peach and peaches are fuzzy so thats why I laughed, but you had a grape, what happened?""

As Air Force One arrives at Heathrow Airport, President Obama strides out to a warm and dignified reception from the Queen.

They are driven in a 1934 Bentley to the edge of central London, where they change to a magnificent 17th-century carriage hitched to six white horses. They continue on towards Buckingham Palace, waving to the thousands of cheering Britons; all is going well.

Suddenly, the right rear horse lets out the most horrendous earth shattering fart ever heard in the British Empire. The smell is so atrocious that both passengers in the carriage must use handkerchiefs over their noses. The fart shakes the coach, but, the two dignitaries of State do their best to ignore the incident.

The Queen politely turns to President Obama and says: 

""Mr. President, please accept my deepest regrets... I am sure you understand there are some things that even a Queen cannot control.""

Obama, always trying to be ""Presidential,"" responded:

""Your Majesty, do not give the matter another thought... Until you mentioned it, I thought it was one of the horses.""",A ride to Buckingham Palace,14

‘I fucked your mother last night and the bitch had a fat ass!’

On and on it goes, until, one day, Barry’s had enough of it, goes in, walks up the stairs to the 2nd floor, and knocks on the door of the parrot’s owner. 

‘I’d like to buy your parrot’, he says to the owner, ‘and I’ll pay $1000 for it’

The owner happily hands him the cage. Barry takes the parrot to a remote area with nobody else around, puts him in a sack, and proceeds to beat the living daylights out of him with a bat. 

When he’s done, he opens the sack, looks at the parrot and says, ‘what have you got to say now’.

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”",First time buying condoms,36

Johnny quickly replied......

Florida Woman Stops Alligator Attack Using a Small Beretta Pistol 
Another good reason to have a concealed weapons permit. 

*This is a story of self-control and marksmanship by a brave, cool-headed woman with a small pistol against a fierce predator.* 

*What's the smallest caliber that you would trust to protect yourself?* 

*Here's her story in her own words:* 

“While out walking along the edge of a pond just outside my house in ‘The Villages’ with my soon to be ex-husband, discussing property settlement and other divorce issues, we were surprised by a huge 12-ft. alligator which suddenly emerged from the murky water and began charging us with its large jaws wide open. She must have been protecting her nest because she was extremely aggressive.” 

“If I had not had my little Beretta .25 caliber pistol with me, I would not be here today!” 

“Just one shot to my estranged husband's knee cap was all it took. The gator got him easily, and I was able to escape by just walking away at a brisk pace. The amount I saved in lawyer's fees was really incredible, and his life insurance was a real big bonus!”

The little old lady said, “I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won’t hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and ravish me?”

The farmer said, “Holy smokes lady! I am carrying a bucket, an anvil, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?”

She replied, “Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the anvil on top of the bucket … and I’ll hold the chickens.”",A farmer goes to a livestock dealer,22

One day the farmer goes out and sees the bull has gone cross-eyed.  This was going to ruin ant chance of future awards, so he called the livestock vet out.

The veterinarian gets there and examines the bull, realizes he's seen this happen before and grabs a narrow metal tube from the back of his truck.

He brings the tube over and jams the tip of it into the bulls hind end and proceeds to blow as hard as he can through the end of it.

The farmer looks at the bulls eyes as the vet is blowing into the bulls backside and says ""it's working! I see his eyes straightening right up, keep doing it!""

The vet blows and blows his face and cheeks turning red and finally says, ""I'm out of breath I can't do it anymore, his eyes are almost straight you'll have to finish""

The farmer comes over and grabs the tube, pulls it out, turns it around and puts it back in the other way, the vet stops him and says, ""What on Earth are you doing?""

‘Wtf’s that?’ says johnny.
‘I’ll show you’ says the woman.

After another short while, the woman feels another fart coming on and thinks, ‘well i got away with the last one, another one should’nt hurt,’ and lets another one go.
At this, johnny reels back again, jumps up and proceeds to get dressed.

‘Where are you going?’ Says the woman.

Al had this weird obsession with going to scrap yards looking for old lead pipes, but I mean we were kids so I really didn't think anything of it at the time. One time, when I was staying the night, I noticed he has a little pile of old lead pipes in the backyard he didn't want me to play with. I mean... I didn't really want to before he said anything... but now... Now it caught my interest. Each time I'd visit I'd sneak out back and look at the pipes and wonder what in the world made these pipes something he would treasure so. I noticed the pile kept getting bigger and bigger too... I figured it must be some Korean thing so I asked his mom, ""Ms. Chemy why does Al have this pile of lead pipes? Is it some kind of ritual?"" she said ""Oh no, Al Chemy is turning lead into gold.""",My friend's obsession,0

I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.

The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.

""No!"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.

""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump. 

The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"". And I just sat there...

One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Three guys were walking in the woods....,0

There once was a bodybuilder. He was about 30 years old and though he had trained all these years, he never entered any competitions. One day it occurred to him he was probably the most ripped man in town and that it was time he showed it. He decided he would look for nearby competitions on the net. He was scrolling when he came across a article called fruit boxing. Out of curiosity he clicked it.  There was a video on the page showing one of the events. The video showed  what looked to him like a giant green lemon in the middle of a ring. About five guys entered and within a minute the green lemon had them all on the floor. The bodybuilder decided he would go see a match. He went to the location provided on the article, and it was just his luck that there was a show about to begin. He got his ticket and sat down. Like in the video the giant green lemon took out hordes of competitors. Then at the end, an announcer asked if anyone was going to challenge the fruit. The bodybuilder, though not a boxer, decided to give it a shot. Maybe he could win something. As soon as he was in the  ring a bell went and the green lemon rushed forward. He was knocked on his back, but he turned his body so he came back up behind it. He raised his hand in an arcing motion, about to strike.

The next day, feeling very embarrassed, the congregation again invited Nasreddin to give a sermon.  This time, when Nasreddin asked if they knew what he was about to say, they all nodded sagely and murmured lowly that they did indeed know what he would say.

""Good!""  Exclaimed Nasreddin.  ""I see I have no need to preach to you, now that you already know what I shall say!""  And with that, he concluded the sermon.

On the third day, the people, utterly perplexed but nonetheless determined to make Nasreddin give a proper sermon, carefully discussed what they should do before inviting Nasreddin back again.  Again, they were asked, ""do you know what I am about to say to you?""  And this time, half of their number nodded yes, while the other half shook their heads no.
