I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored it's not even funny. That butt-chinned boy has been as persistent as a fly; he's so annoying! I wish eh would just shoo off!

Everyday he comes up to me and begs to be my disciple. He tries to woo me with his ""moves"" he tries repeatedly to show off his skills to me so I can take him in as my student.

""You will agree to take me in as your student when I show you my technique!""

""You said that last week, and the week before that. What next? Butt-chiseled punch? Or Super-Butt-Kick? I'm sick of it!""

""No. This technique will surely wow you!""

""Fine. Just get it over with.""

""Ok. Here goes. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!""

He assumes as stance as he yells like a screaming monkey. What is this buffoon up to now?  

Before he could show me his new ""technique"" a giant ape-like creature jumps from behind and punches him to the ground. 

""OOOOOOOOOOO-OOOOOOOOO-AAAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

The butt-chinned boy's face is slammed in the concrete. This creature has the appearance of a giant humanoid ape. His body is covered in fur yet his features are strikingly human-like. He has a nose, two eyes, hands with thumbs, ears, oh--wait monkeys already have that. Never mind a giant monkey is in front of me. 

""I am a monkey who loved humans so much I turned into a human. Now that girlfriend broke up with me I will destroy the world!"" The giant monkey whacks his chest like a gorilla. I guess he is a gorilla. ""Can you believe it! She called me a monkey! She said that she wants a human! After all what I did to her she wants a human! That's why I will destroy the world! And take REVENGE!!!!""

""Oh I see.""

""Prepare yourself HUMAN!!! Prepare to suffer the wrath of my heart-broken fist! I am the Man-Ape!""

The primate leaps at me with his fist positioned to punch. 

""Too slow."" I easily dodge his fat knuckles. He tries to hit me by punching repeatedly. ""Too slow.""

""You there MONKEY! Get your hands away from my master!"" The butt-chinned boy gets up after being slammed to the ground by the Man-Ape.""Watch master as I beat this ape into a pulp!"" 

""Hahahahaha!!! You think that your puny little fist can match my majestic knuckles? Fool I will bury you right hear and now!""

The butt-chinned boy runs at Man-Ape and kicks him in his stomach. The monkey tries to pound him to the ground, this time the butt-chinned boy dodges his attack and jumps up and kicks him in his cheek. Th butt-chinned boy leaps up at him and punches Man-Ape in the cheek. Man-Ape uppercuts the butt-chinned boy in his stomach. Drool is basted from his lips as pain shoots up through his abdomen.  Before he plummets to the ground once more the butt-chinned boy grits his teeth together and screams.


""MASTER! I will show you my new secret technique!"" He lifts his chin in the air and ""Chin-butts"" Man-Ape in the bridge of his nose. ""Super-secret technique: Ultimate flaming phoenix chin-butt!!!!""

""AAAAARRGGHHH!!!!"" Man-Ape falls to the ground in pain. Both of them are in pain. ""That actually hurt! But in the end I win!""

The butt-chinned boy is unconscious from the impact of his ""ultimate technique"". I don't really know why I saved him but I guess I felt bad for him.

I grabbed Man-Ape's fist just as he was about to pummel the butt-chinned boy into oblivion.

""Are you done with this?""

""No! I will bury you next!""

""Oh I see.""

I punch Man-Ape in his stomach and he immediately goes flying back into a concrete wall.

""How...can this...I lost?""

""No...I just didn't lose.""

After a while both Man-Ape and butt-chinned boy stand up.

""I am sorry for the damage I did. What is your name?'

""I am Can't-Lose Man.""

""Can you please accept me as your student! I still have much to learn in the ways of being human. Please!""

Oh come on! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To his surprise, a rich man in a Ferrari pulled up next to him to pump gas into his $600,000 car. As the rich man was pumping gas he looked over at the bewildered redneck. Noticing the admiration on his face the rich man asked, in a cocky tone, ""what, you wanna race farm boy?"" Not one to back down to a challenge the redneck replied in a defiant tone ""I sure do city boy!""

Shortly after that, the two men had there cars lined up on a super long stretch of straight road. The two men were standing in between the two cars discussing how to insure a fair start.

They finally concluded that the rich man would hold up 3 fingers and do a count down. When the last finger dropped they would go for it. So the rich man opened his door and stepped into his car, then the redneck walked around to the door of his car and climbed in.

The rich man started the count down and when the last finger fell they took off.

The rich man decided to toy with the redneck and only shift up to second gear, but by the time he got to full speed in second gear the pinto was just a dot in his rear view mirror. ""What a waste of time."" the rich man thought.

suddenly, RRRRROOOOOOMMMMMM!!! The pinto went roaring by.

""Whoa!"" the rich man said. So then he shifted up into 3rd then 4th gear to still give the redneck a sporting chance. Once again the pinto became a dot in his rear view mirror.

RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!!! To the rich man's surprise the pinto went flying by again!

""FINE!"" The rich man shouted. So then he went all out, shifting up into 6th gear and putting the pedal to the floor. By now the Ferrari was doing about 210 Mph. The Ferrari blew by the pinto and once again the pinto became a tiny speck in his rear view.

RRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!! The pinto blew by him again, practically blowing the Ferrari's doors off.

Having been beaten by the pinto the rich man pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. In a rage he got out and slammed his door as the redneck backed up next to his car.

""WHAT KIND OF MOTOR DO YOU HAVE IN THAT PINTO!"" Shouted the rich man.

The redneck climbed out of his Pinto shaking like a nervous Chihuahua and replied, ""I have no idea, BUT I GOT MY SUSPENDERS CAUGHT IN YOUR DOOR!!""

The owner of the zoo goes to Jerry, the gorilla keeper, to see what can be done.  Jerry explains, ""The female there is lonely.  With no other gorillas to keep her company, she sits around depressed and doesn't do anything.  Nobody wants to watch a gorilla sit around.""

The owner of the zoo makes several calls but can't find a male gorilla that anyone will loan to the zoo, so he comes up with a plan.  He goes to back to Jerry and says, ""Look, I've got an idea.  I've got a gorilla suit.  Now all you would need to do is wear it in the cage for a few hours every day and just kind of...  monkey around.  So she doesn't feel so lonely, you know?  You'll get your regular pay, plus $500 a week.  Whaddya say?""

Jerry agrees, and the following day, he gets into the cage wearing his gorilla suit and starts milling around, doing what he would expect a gorilla to do.  Before long, the real gorilla takes notice, gets up, and starts moving around, too.  Visitors start to respond immediately, and a crowd starts to grow.  Word gets out, and within a couple of weeks, business is booming again.  That's how it goes for awhile, until one day, slowly, the people start to get bored with the gorilla exhibit again, and the crowds taper off.

The owner goes to Jerry again, ""Jerry, I need you to spice things up.  It's the same old boring stuff every day.  You gotta get people's attention!  Get the gorilla excited!  Have fun in there!""  So Jerry gets back in the cage and starts swinging around on the monkey bars, rolling tires, and generally being more active.  The gorilla follows suit, and business picks back up.

Jerry starts to notice people becoming less interested, and he knows what needs to be done.  He starts going wild, running, jumping, throwing things, beating his chest, swinging around like a maniac...  but the gorilla suit is a little cumbersome, and he ends up slipping, mid-swing.  He flies over the wall and lands right in the middle of the next enclosure over:  the lion enclosure.  The crowd erupts into chaos.  Everyone runs to the lion enclosure to see if ""the gorilla"" is okay.

The fall knocked the wind out of Jerry, and it took him a few minutes to regain his bearings.  After a long moment, he started to stand up, only to see a large lion, slowly walking straight toward him.  He was frozen with fear.  The crowd looked on as the lion stalked closer and closer.  Jerry started to scream, ""Help!  H--"" when the lion pounced, knocking Jerry flat on the ground.  Jerry was terrified beyond belief.  The lion hit Jerry across the face with its massive paw, and just as he was sure this was the end, he heard the lion say, ""*Shut the fuck up, Jerry!  You're gonna get us both fired!!*""

**The zoo has a problem with their gorilla... (II)**

They aren't drawing the crowds they used to, and it's hurting their revenue in a big way.  The owner of the zoo goes to Jerry, the gorilla keeper, to see what can be done.  Jerry explains, ""The female there has gone into heat, and with no males to mate with, she sits around depressed and doesn't do anything.  Nobody wants to watch a gorilla sit around.""

The owner of the zoo makes several calls but can't find a male gorilla that anyone will loan to the zoo, so he comes up with a plan.  He goes to back to Jerry and says, ""Look, I've got an idea.  Now...  *feel free to say no here.*  NO PRESSURE.  But...  well... for $500, do you think you could you fuck the gorilla?  Just one time?  She should be back to normal after that, right?""

Jerry says, ""I don't know about that, I mean...  Well, $500 is a lot of money...  and...  I mean...  I just don't know.  I'll have to think about it.""  The owner of the zoo tells Jerry to sleep on it and give him an answer the following day at closing time, and he agrees.

The following day, Jerry is sweeping up as the last of the guests are leaving when he hears the zoo owner's voice behind him, ""Did you think about my offer?""  Jerry stops sweeping for a moment, turns around, sighs deeply and says, ""Yeah, I did.  I thought long and hard about it, and I need to talk to you.""  The zoo owner says, ""Well, what do we need to talk about?""  Jerry continues, ""I'll do it.  But I've got 2 conditions.""

The zoo owner says, ""Well, that's reasonable enough so far.  What are they?""  Jerry says, ""Well, the first one--and this is not negotiable--is...  well...   I'm *not* kissin her.  No way.  Just straight sex, nothing else.""  The zookeeper, somewhat relieved and stifling a laugh, reassures Jerry, ""Of course, that'll be fine.  I don't think they really go for that sort of thing anyway.  Just the old in-and-out.  So what's the second condition?""

Hesitant, Jerry hangs his head for a moment.  He shakes his head a few times, then looks the zoo owner in the eyes and says, ""Well, I hope this isn't a deal-breaker, but...  well...  it's gonna take me a few days to come up with the five hundred bucks...""

Timmy and Johnny grew up together, side by side
Only a year apart in age 
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
They love to play with fake plastic guns 
""Bang Bang"" is all you'd hear for hours as they played Cowboys and Indians to cops and robbers 
°°°°°°°°°°°
Their love for guns evolved from using their fingers as babies, to plastic toys as toddlers. From Nerf arsenals and paintball as children to airsoft and pellet guns in their teens
°°°°°°°° 
It was in high school when the boys decided they wanted to make a difference in the community so they joined the police force.
An even bigger plus was they got to use their gun.
°°°°°° 
Eventually they wanted to join the military and after the Don't ask don't tell policy was passed they both got their wish.
°°°°°
On their 5th and last tour of Afghanistan while clearing a tunnel a terrorist came around a corner throwing a grenade. The boys ran for cover. Johnny made it to safety but Timmy wasn't so lucky.
°°°
Johnny spent most of his time playing online shooter games after Timmys passing.
He said one game was unrealistic and sued the company because his  granade shrapnel wouldn't kill his enemies but he lost his brother in a similar incident while in combat.
°°
EA declared to game informer that they""...intend to get to the bottom of the granade problem and be sure to honor Timmys family with a virtual death he would be proud of.""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. 
Do you think I could stay the night?

the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. 

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,

We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. 

Some years later, 

The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. 

The monks again accept him, feed him, even fix his car.

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles When you find these numbers,

you will become a monk.

The man sets about his task.

Some 45 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,

I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are

145,236,284,232 blades of grass and

231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk.

We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says,

The sound is right behind that door.

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key?

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. 

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire,

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,

silver,

topaz, 

and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know end.

He unlocks the door,

turns the knob, 

and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound

So they stopped. Jane, their leader, a voluptuous woman of 53, gets off her Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk him down off the railing, and says, ""Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?"" He says tearfully, ""I'm going to kill myself!!"" While she didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so she asked, ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . . why don't you give ol' Jane here your best last kiss?"" So, with no hesitation at all, he leaned back over the railing and did just that . . . and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one. After they breathlessly finished, Jane gets a big thumbs-up approval from her biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?"" He explained, ""Ethics in game journalism."" It's still unclear whether he jumped or was pushed.",The Hell's Angels are riding once more,0

The morgue needed someone to identify the body, so they sent for his two bestfriends, Jack and Oscar.

The three men had always done everything together.

Jack arrived first, and when the mortician pulled back the sheet,

Jack said, 'Yup, his face is burned up pretty bad. You better roll him over.'

The mortician rolled him over and Jack said, 'Nope, ain't Stanley .'

The mortician thought this was rather strange.

So he brought Oscar in to confirm the identity of the body.

Oscar looked at the body and said, 'Yup, he's pretty well burnt up.

Roll him over.'

The mortician rolled him over and Oscar said, 'No, it ain't Stanley '

The mortician asked, 'How can you tell?'

Oscar said, 'Well, Stanley had two assholes.'

'What? He had two assholes?' asked the mortician.

'Yup, we never seen 'em, but everybody used to say:

'There's Stanley with them two assholes.'",Stanley died in a fire and his body was burned pretty badly...,78

The leader of the cannibals tells them that if they value their life, they can be released, but on one condition. Each of them has to run into the forest on the island, find ten fruits, come back and shove them up their ass without wincing, laughing, or otherwise making any sound. If they fail, they will be killed immediately.

So the Englishman runs into the forest, comes back with ten bananas and starts the deed. He manages to get one banana inside, and starts the second. Unable to stand the pain he screams and is promptly put to death.

The Spaniard then runs into the forest and runs back with ten berries and begins his trial. He manages to get one, two, three....seven......eight....nine...and then unexpectedly bursts out laughing. He is promptly put to death.

Up in heaven, the Englishman sees the newly arrived Spaniard and questions him “What happened? You were doing so well. You were almost a free man!!”

Jim is paralyzed with fear. The car is moving at a steady pace, silently and driverlessly. As the car approaches a bend in the road, a pale hand reaches in through the window and twists the steering wheel.

The car proceeds through the empty streets in this manner. After a while, Jim manages enough wits and strength to fling the door open, jump out and run away from the car, not looking back once.

He finds a bar still open, and quickly orders a drink to calm his nerves. When questioned by the patrons on his shaken complexion, he tells them the chilling story.

As the crowd murmurs fearfully about the haunted car, the door slams open and two sweaty, tired looking men walk in. They their eyes scan the room. Suddenly, one of them taps the other on the shoulder, and exclaims:

a portrait that had them completely confused. The painting depicted 3 black 
men totally naked, sitting on a bench. Two of the figures had black penises, 
but the one in the middle had a pink penis.

The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting 
the painting and offered his personal assessment.  He went on for over half 
an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African
Americans in a predominately white, patriarchal society. 'In fact', he pointed 
out, 'some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural
and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society'.

After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, 'Would 
you like to know what the painting is really about?'
'Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the 
gallery', asked the couple?
'Because I am the artist, who painted the picture,' he replied. 'In fact, there are 
no African Americans depicted at all.  They're just three Irish coal miners.

post,41odhd,2qh72,jokes,false,1453205790,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/41odhd/drunk_jokes/,self.jokes,,"(1)Two men are drinking in a bar at the top of the Empire State
Building. One turns to the other and says: ""You know last week I
discoveredthat if you jump from the top of this building-by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.""
The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while
wiping the bar.
The 2nd Man says: ""What are you a nut? There is no way in hell that could happen.""
1st Man:  ""No it's true let me prove it to you.""  So he gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens to the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar.
The 2nd Man tells him: ""You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.""
1st Man: ""No, I'll prove it again"" and again he jumps and hurtles
toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.
2nd Man: ""Well what the hell, it works, I'll try it."" he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors... and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'

Back upstairs the Bartender turns to the other drinker: ""You
know, Superman, you're a real asshole when you're drunk.

(2)A drunk was walking down the beach when he came across a genie lamp. Being somewhat skeptical, the drunk half-heartedly rubbed the lamp. To his amazement there was a puff of blue smoke, and a genie appeared!
""You now have one wish"", said the Genie.
""But I thought I got three"", protested the drunk.
""You've been watching too much TV"" said the genie. ""Now make it quick!""
""In that case, I'll take a MILLION BUCKS!""
In an instant there was another puff of smoke and the genie, as well as the lamp, were gone. Surrounding the drunk were ducks, as far as the eye could see. First furious, then utterly depressed, the drunk walked aimlessly for miles down the beach followed by an endless procession of ducks.
Finally, in the distance, he saw the bright neon lights of an ocean-side bar. 
""Now, that's what I need!"" he thought to himself. And, doing what came naturally, he went inside to drown his sorrows. As he sat down at the bar another gentleman, noticing the ducks, said ""Hey pal, what gives?""
""Oh this stupid genie is hard of hearing! I actually asked for a million BUCKS!"" ""I see"", said the second man. ""You know, I once found a genie lamp too!""
""Really?"" said the drunk. ""What did you get?""
The second man pulled a small piano out of his pocket, then a miniature stool. Finally he took a one-foot-tall man out of his pocket who sat down and started playing bar songs.
""That's something else! But why did you ask for that?"" inquired the drunk. 
""Come on..."" responded the second man, ""You don't REALLY think I asked for a 12-inch pianist do you?""

(3) A drunk goes in a bar and asks for a shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk pushes it aside and asks for another shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk drinks it. The bartender says, ""I watched what you did and I don't understand why you pushed the first one away and drank the second one!"" The drunk stated,"" I've been going to those AA Meetings, and they said WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST DRINK!!!"".

(4)A drunken guy was driving down a one way street the wrong way, a cop stopped him and asked ""didn't you see the arrows?"" The drunk driver replied ""Arrows, Hell I didn't even see the Indians.""

(5)Staking out a notoriously rowdy bar for possible drunk drivers, a cop watched from his squad car as a fellow stumbled out the door, tripped on the kerb and tried 45 cars before opening the door to his own and falling asleep on the front seat. One by one, the drivers of the other cars drove off. Finally, the sleeper woke up, started his car and began to leave. The cop pulled him over and administered a Breathalyzer test. When the results showed a 0.0 blood-alcohol level, the puzzled policeman asked him how that was possible.""Easy,"" was the reply. ""Tonight was my turn to be the decoy"".

(6)Three guys come into work Monday morning, each bragging about how drunk they were over the weekend. The first says, ""I was so drunk Saturday I was blowing chunks all night."" The second says, ""That's nothing. I was so drunk that I blacked out, tried to drive home, and wound up spending Sunday in jail."" The third then says ""Big deal. I got so drunk this weekend that I picked up a hooker, brought her home, and was banging her on the kitchen counter when my wife walked in on us."" The first guy then interupts and says, ""But you dont understand... Chunks is my dog.""

(7)A drunk was walking along the beach when he saw a bottle. He stopped and rubbed it and a genie popped out.
""You have 3 wishes"" said the genie.
The alcholic said, ""I'll take a bottle that is never empty."" Whamo he has a bottle that is never empty and starts to drink. The genie taps him on the shoulder and says, ""and what are your other two wishes?"" ""Oh,"" says the alcoholic, ""I'll have two more like this one.""

(8)One day in Dodge City, a cowboy rides into town. He pulls up outside the saloon, gets off of his horse, and ties him up to the hitchin post. He then walks around back of it, lifts the tail and kisses the horses backside with puckered lips. He then walks into the saloon. Across the street an oldtimer can't believe what he has just seen, so he rushes across the street and bursts into the saloon where he sees the cowboy drinking at the bar. ""Hey mister"" he says, ""did you just kiss your hoss' ass?"" ""Yup"" says the cowboy. The oldtimer says, ""if you don't mind me askin, why'd you do that? ""Cuz I got chapped lips,"" says the cowboy ""And kissin your hoss' ass cures chapped lips?"" ""Nope"" says the cowboy, ""but it sure keeps me from licking them.""

(9)Two rednecks, Bubba and Gator, were driving down the road drinking a couple of bottles of bud. The passenger, Bubba,said. ""Lookey thar up ahead, Gator, it's a po-lice roadblock! We're gonna get busted fer drinkin these here beers!! ""Don't worry Bubba"" Gator said. ""We'll just pull over and finish drinkin these beers, peel off the label and stick it on our foreheads, and throw the bottles under the seat"". ""What fer?"" Asked Bubba. ""Just let me do the talkin okay?"" Said Gator. Well, they finished their beers,threw the empty bottles under the seat, and each put a label on their forehead. When they reached the roadblock, the sherriff said, ""You boys been drinkin?"". ""No sir"" Gator said. ""We're on the patch.""

(10)If you're not supposed to drink and drive, why do bars have parking lots?

(11)A bloke goes into a pub, takes a seat at the bar, and orders five pints. The barman gives him an odd look since the bloke's all by himself, but he serves up the five pints and lines them up on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four, Five. He finishes the last one and calls to the barman, ""Four pints, please, mate!"" The barman serves up four pints and lines them on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four. Then he belches loudly, sways slightly on the stool, and orders three more pints. And one after the other, he knocks them back.... One, Two, Three. ""Two pintsh, mate!"" he calls, and the barman places two pints in front of him. Down they go.... One, Two. As the bloke slams the last one down on the bar, he says, ""One pint, mate."" So the barman fills the glass. The bloke sits there, staring at it for for a moment, trying to focus. Then he looks at the barman and says, ""Y'know, it'sh a funny t'ing, but the less I drink, the drunker I get...""

(12)A drunk gets up from the bar and heads for the restroom. A few minutes later, a loud, blood curdling scream is heard. A few minutes after that, another loud scream reverberates through the bar. The bartender goes to investigate.

""What's all the screaming about in there? You're scaring my customers!""

""I'm just sitting here on the toilet and every time I try to flush, something comes up and sqeezes the hell out of my balls,"" replies the drunk.

With that, the bartender opens the door, looks in and says, ""You idiot! You're sitting on the mop wringer bucket!""

(13)Two drunks were walking along a railroad track. One says, ""All these stairs are killing me."" The other says, ""It's not the stairs that kill me, it's these low railings.""

(14)A man walks into a bar and notices a 100-dollar bill in a frame above the bar.  He asks the barkeep, ""Was that the first hundred you made?"" ""No"", replied the bartender.  ""That's for a contest we have but no one's ever won."" ""I want to play"", said the man. ""Well"", said the barkeep, ""There are three parts to this contest:  The first thing you have to do is knock out that bouncer over there.  Only one man has ever done that.  The second thing you have to do is go out back.  I have a pit-bull out there with a loose tooth.  You have to pull that tooth out.  The guy who knocked out my bouncer ended up in the hospital when he tried that one.  Finally, you have to make love to that 400-pound woman sitting at the back of the bar. ""Upon hearing the third requirement, the man said ""No thanks, I'll pass"".  However, after a good amount of drinking the man reconsidered and yelled to the barkeep ""Bring it on!  What's first?"" ""The bouncer"" said the bartender.  Upon hearing this, the man promptly walked over to the bouncer and laid him out with one punch. ""Impressive! Now for the pit-bull"", said the bartender. The man went out back.  For about five minutes all that could be heard was barking and crashing, and finally a dog's whimper.  The man walked back into the bar proudly and, zipping up his pants, said ""Now where's that fat bitch with the loose tooth?""

(15)This really drunk guy walks up to a parking meter and puts in a quarter. He stares at the needle that has stopped at 60 and exclaims, ""I can't believe I lost 100 pounds!"" 

(16)What's the difference between a bar and a g-spot?
Most men have no trouble finding a bar. 

(17)Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder...

(18)What would you call a drunk who works at an upholstery shop? A recovering alcoholic.  

(19)Two friends were out drinking when suddenly one lurched backward off his barstool and lay motionless on the floor. ""One thing about Jim,"" his buddy said to the bartender, ""He knows when to stop."" 

(20)There was a guy who had at least 4-5 drinks of whiskey every day of his adult life. When he died, they cremated him, and it took two days to put out the fire! 

(21)How do you know that a female bartender is pissed off with you? There's a string hanging out of your Bloody Mary. 

(22)Where does an Irish family go on vacation? 
A different bar. 

(23)What is the difference between an Irish wedding and an Irish Funeral? One less drunk.

(24)How many Irish does it take to change a light bulb?
Twenty One. One to hold the bulb and twenty to drink until the room spins. 

(25) A Poem: A beer was spilt on the barroom floor, 
And the bar was closed for the night...
And out of his hole, crawled a little brown mouse, 
Who made a funny sight...
He lapped up that beer, on the barroom floor, 
And back on his haunches he sat...
And all through the night you could hear him yell, 
""Bring on the damn cat!""  

(26)After spending a happy evening drinking together, two acquaintances promise to meet again in ten years at the same bar, same time. 

Ten years later, the first guy walks in, looks around, and sure enough, there is his friend on a bar stool. He clasps the old friend's hand and cries, ""The day we left, I didn't think I'd really see you here!"" 

The friend looks up, stares, sways slightly and asks, ""Who left?"" 

(27)A man comes in to the room and says to his wife, ""I'm going to the pub. Get your coat on."" 

The wife, overjoyed that he has included her in his activity replies, ""Does that mean that you are taking me with you, darling?"" 

The husband replies, ""No - I'm turning the heating off."" 

(28)Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel ashamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. 

Then I say to myself, ""It is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver."" 

(29)Two young Irish men were getting ready to go on a camping trip. The first one said, ""I'm taking along a gallon of whiskey just in case of rattlesnake bites. What are you taking?"" 

The other one said, ""Two rattlesnakes!""

(30)A rather drunk man was walking along the street one day. He was staggering quite a bit and made two nuns that were approaching him, very nervous. The two nuns split apart and one walked to the man's left and one walked to the man's right. 

After the nuns were past the man, he turned around and said, ""Now how in the hell did she do that?"" 

(31)This small skinny dude walks up to the bar and starts to sit on a bar stool, and a big dude on the next stool says, ""That seat's taken!"" 

The little dude sits down anyway. The big dude grabs him and whacks him several times with the back of his hand and tells the bartender, ""When he wakes up, tell him that was Judo from Japan."" 

Next day the little dude returns, before the big dude gets a chance to hit him, he hits the big dude several times and the big dude falls to the floor. The little dude tells the bartender, ""Tell that sucker when he wakes up, that was a Monkey Wrench from Sears."" 

(32)The car sped off the highway, went through the guardrail, rolled down a cliff, bounced off a tree and finally shuddered to a stop. A passing motorist, who had witnessed the entire accident, helped the miraculously unharmed driver out of the wreck. 

""Good lord, mister,"" he gasped, ""Are you drunk?"" 

""Of course,"" said the man, brushing the dirt from his suit. ""What the hell do you think I am ... a stunt driver?"" 

(33)A man walks into a bar and orders a beer and the bartender asks him to pay up. The guy says he has no money, but for the beer, he will sing through his asshole. The bartender is a little bit skeptical, but figures if the guy can do it, it's worth a beer. He agrees and the guy gets up on a stool, drop his pants, bends over, and then shits all over the bar. The bartender is pissed and screams, ""What the hell did you do that for?"" 

The guy replies, ""Sorry, I was just clearing my throat."" 

(34)Another rotten poem: Starkle, starkle, little twink,
Who the hell are you I think.
I'm not under what you call,
The alcofluence of incohol.
I'm just a little slort of sheep,
I'm not drunk like thinkle peep.
I don't know who is me yet,
But the drunker I stand here the longer I get.
So just give me one more fink to drill my cup,
'Cause I got all day sober to Sunday up. 

(35)A boy is watching television and hears the name Jesus Christ. Wondering who Jesus Christ is, he asks his mother. She tells him that she is busy, and to ask his father. His father is also busy so he asks his brother. His brother kicks him out of the room because he doesn't have time to answer his stupid questions, so he goes downtown and sees a bum in an alley. 

He asks the bum, ""Who's Jesus Christ?"" 

The bum replies, ""Well, I am."" 

The boy, not believing the bum, asks for proof. So the bum takes the boy into the bar down the street and takes him inside. They walk up to the bar and the bartender exclaims, ""Jesus Christ, are you in here again?"" 

(36)A completely inebriated man was stumbling down the street with one foot on the curb and one foot in the gutter. A cop pulled up and said, ""I've got to take you in, pal. You're obviously drunk."" 

Our wasted friend asked, ""Ociffer, are ya absolutely sure I'm drunk?"" 

""Yeah, buddy, I'm sure,"" said the copper. ""Let's go."" 

Breathing a sigh of relief, the wino said, ""Thank goodness, I thought I was a cripple."" 

(37)Two buddies were sharing drinks while discussing their wives. ""Does your wife ever...well, you know...does she...well, let you do it doggie style?"" asked one of the two. 

""Well, not exactly,"" his friend replied, ""She's more into the trick dog aspect of it."" 

""Oh, I see. Kinky stuff, huh?"" 

""Well, not exactly. Whenever I make a move, she's most likely to roll over and play dead."" 

(38)A guy goes up to a girl in bar and asks, ""You want to play ""Magic""?"" 

She says, ""What's that?"" 

The guy answers, ""We go to my house and screw, and then you disappear."" 

(39)

There is man sitting in a bar who is really, really drunk. When the bar closes he gets up to go home. He stumbles and falls couple of times and finally manages to get out of the door. As he gathers himself, he sees a nun passing by. He stumbles over to her and starts punching her in the face. The nun is shocked beyond belief, but before she could say anything, he leans over and punches her again. 

This time the nun hits the pavement. The drunk stumbles over to her, kicks her in the butt, picks her up and throws her against the wall. By now the nun is very weak and can barely move. He leans over her, grabbing her by the collar of her habit and says, ""Not feeling too STRONG tonight, ARE YOU, BATMAN!""  

(40)This guy goes into a bar and sees a man pounding shots of bourbon as fast as the bartender can pour them. He watches for a while then finally goes up to the drunk. 

""What kind of a way is that to drink good bourbon?"" he asks. 

""It's the only way I can drink it since my accident,"" the man replies, throwing down two more shots in fast order. 

""What kind of accident was that?"" 

The man guzzles another shot, shudders and then answers, ""I once knocked over a drink with my elbow."" 

(41)An Irish guy walks into a bar. The bartender looks him up and down and says, ""Hey, you got a steering wheel on your pecker."" 

The man replies, ""Ay, it's driving me nuts!"" 

(42)

A guy traveling through the prairies of the USA stopped at a small town and went to a bar. He stood at the end of the bar, ordered a drink, and lit up a cigar. As he sipped his drink, he stood there quietly blowing smoke rings. 

After he blew nine or ten smoke rings into the air, an angry American Indian stomped up to him and said, ""One more remark like that and I'll smash your face in!""

(43)A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, much like the brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. The slowest buffalo are the sick and weak so they die off first, making it possible for the herd to move at a faster pace. 

Like the buffalo, the weak, slow brain cells are the ones that are killed off by excessive beer drinking and socializing, making the brain operate faster. 

The moral of the story: Drink more beer, it will make you smarter. 

(44)Bill sat at The Local Bar, bragging about his athletic prowess. None of the regulars challenged him, but a visitor piped up, ""I'll bet you 50 bucks that I can push something in a wheelbarrow for one block and you can't wheel it back."" 

Bill looked over the skinny stranger and decided it wasn't much of a challenge. ""I'll"" take you on,"" he said. 

The two men and a number of regulars borrowed a wheelbarrow and took it to the corner. ""Now let's see what you're made of,"" taunted Bill. 

""Okay,"" said the challenger. ""Get in."" 

(45)This guy enters a bar and orders two shots of vodka. He drinks the first and dumps the second on his right hand. He then orders a second round of shots, drinks the first and again dumps the second on his right hand. 

The bartender sees this and becomes curious as the guy orders a third round and does the exact same thing. 

So the bartender asks the guy, ""Hey man I hope you don't mind me asking but why the waste of good drinks?"" 

The man say's, ""I have to get my date drunk!"" 

(46)While nursing a drink at a bar, a young woman was distressed to see a drunken, unkempt man sit down next to her. He says, ""Say, honey. . . I'd really like to get into those pants o' yours."" 

""Thanks,"" she shot back, ""but I've already got an asshole in there."" 

(47)Sitting at the bar, glum Roger told the barkeeper that he was drinking to forget the heartbreak of his broken engagement. ""Yeah,"" said Roger, ""would you marry someone who didn't know the meaning of the word faithful, and who was flip and even vicious when the subject of fidelity came up?"" 

""No way in hell,"" the bartender said. 

""Well,"" said Roger, ""neither would my fiancée."" 

(48)A guy runs into a bar and says to the bartender, ""Give me twenty shots of your best scotch, quick!"" The bartender pours out the shots, and the guy drinks them as fast as he can. 

The bartender says, ""Wow. I never saw anybody drink that fast."" 

The guy replies, ""Well, you'd drink that fast too if you had what I have."" 

The bartender says ""Oh my God! What is it? What do you have?"" The guy says, ""Fifty cents."" 

(49) McNamara walked into a bar and ordered martini after martini, each time removing the olives and placing them in a jar. When the jar was filled with olives and all the drinks consumed, the Irishman started to leave. 

""Excuse me,"" said a customer, who was puzzled over what McQuillan had done. ""What was that all about?"" 

""Nothing,"" said the Irishman, ""My wife just sent me out for a jar of olives."" 

(50)Having had one too many, a bar drinker was beginning to display an ugly side. An unescorted female sat down beside him and he whispered to her, ""Hey! How about it babe? You and me?"" 

As she got up to move, he said loudly, ""Honey, you sure look like you could use the money, but I don't have an extra two dollars."" 

She looked back and replied just as loudly, ""What makes you think I charge by the inch?"" ",Drunk Jokes,3

Everyone involved was concerned that these crows might have died from Avian Flu, so they had a bird pathologist examine the remains of all the crows. To everyone's relief, it was determined that the problem was definitely not the Avian Flu. Instead, the cause of death looked to be from vehicular impacts.

During the detailed analysis of the crows, it was noted that there were varying colors of paints found on the birds' beaks and claws. By analyzing the paint residue, it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by the impact of trucks, and only 2% were from impact with a car.

The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority then hired an ornithological behaviorist to look into the cause for the disproportionate percentages of crows killed by trucks versus crows killed by cars.

The ornithological behaviorist came up with the answer very quickly. The cause? When crows eat roadkill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn the other crows of impending danger.

While all the lookout crows could say the word ""Cah,"" none of them could say ""Truck.""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . . and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one. After they breathlessly finished, John gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?"" She explained, ""My parents don't like me laughing at dead trans people on Reddit.com."" It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.

So they stopped.
John, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, ""Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""
She says tearfully, ""I'm going to kill myself!!""
While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" John also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked, ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . . why don't you give ol' John here your best last kiss?""
So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . . and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.
After they breathlessly finished, John gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""
She explained, ""My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.""
It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.

The man had been feeling a little over weight so he decided to call the sign. A woman answered the phone and told him to be at the local hangout the following morning. 

The next morning comes and the man is at the local hangout when a woman walks up to him. The woman asked ""are you here about the ad?"" To which the man replied yes. The woman then motions the man to come inside. 

Once inside a door opened and a beautiful woman stood their naked with a sign that said ""if you can catch me you can have your way with me!"" Upon seeing this the man takes off trying to catch the woman to no avail.

The next week he sees the  same sign but this time it said ""lose weight now! $40!"" The man calls the sign again ad inquires why it's  $40 where as the first time was free. The woman says ""show up and see.""

Next day comes and the man shows up. He hands the woman $40 and she opens a door. This time an even more beautiful woman stood there with the same sign. Again the man gives chase but to no avail. 

So obviously frustrated at this point the man decides to invest in a proper pair of running shoes. This time he's sure he'll catch the woman. Well he stumbled upon the same sign but this time it read ""lose weight now $60!"" Knowing this he figured this time it would be an even more beautiful woman. 

So the following day comes and he shows up with his money in hand. The woman opens the door and this time there stood a large gorrila. The gorilla had a sign around his neck and it said ""if I catch you I get my way with you!""

The excited chatter dropped to silence as Claude carefully withdrew from his waistcoat pocket a beautiful antique gold pocket watch and chain.
""I want you to keep your eyes on this watch"" said Claude, holding the watch high for all to see. ""It is a very special and valuable watch that has been in my family for six generations"" said Claude.

The biker is thankful and responds.

&gt;Wow God, thanks! I'm not really sure... Actually yeah, I want a bridge to Hawaii to ride my Harley on!

God seems a bit surprised and adds:

&gt;Are you sure? I was expecting something a bit more spiritual, something related to knowledge. Do you know how much it would take to build such a bridge? It would take a huge amount of labor and an unimaginable amount of resources, not to mention there needs to be pillars that go to the bottom of the ocean.

&gt;Yeah you're right, I'm asking for too much. Now that I think about it, I really want to understand my wife better, most of the I'm just clueless about how she feels or what she means, can you help me with that?

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American man who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the southern redneck.”

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. “I’m sorry,” she said, “I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don’t even know your name.”

Now I am a 33 year old unemployed self proclaimed Can't-Lose Man. I have fought countless monsters and killed them all. In the beginning I used to have really fun battles with them until I won, but lately I have been squashing monsters and beating villains with as little as one punch. Why's that?

I wanted to be a hero so I can save the world and have fun, not just punch and kill! Fighting now is sooooooooo boring!

I want to meet Super-Duper Man maybe he can offer stimulus to my existence.

Wait...
Just relax.
Maybe all I need to do is clear my head and try something new.

I have been fighting monster and monster and evil warlords for 4 years now. Maybe i need to fight someone who is different. Not a villain but a person who still has high levels of experience in the art of killing. I need to fight a martial artist.

Exactly where do I find that savage kung-fu killer is the real problem. I don't know any martial artists. I searched the streets over and over searching for that one person that can reignit my passion for fighting. But...I didn't find him.

""Sir...
I try to stop a man as he walks down the street. He simply ignores me.
""Sir...
I try again but he simply shrugs me off.
""Sir sir sir sir sir...
""WHAT!? WHAT DO YOU WANT!?""
""Are you a martial artist?""
""Are you mental? Do you have a drug problem.
""Uuugh no?""
""Well get away from me.""
The man leaves me as he continues walking down the street.

I try to stop a woman this time. But before I can ask her she screams ""MOLESTER!!!!!"" and runs away from me.

This went on and on for sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long!

Finally when I got tired of asking people a homeless old man approaches me.

""Boy I watched you all day. If you want to find a martial artist try looking in a Dojo.""

""Dojo?""

""Yes. One of the world's best Dojo's is ""Sensie Buttchan's academy for Butt-chin-Fu.""

""Really!?""

""Yes it's on 1234 Cheese Burger Street.""

""THANK YOU OLD MAN!!!!""

""No problem. I just hope that you find the person the rekindles your passion for killing.""

Immediately I ran as fast as I could to the Dojo. Surprisingly i was only 150 kilometers away.

When I arrived to the Dojo I slammed open the door so hard the glass broke.

""Oh sorry.""

Apparently there was a class going on at the moment. They all stop and look at me.

""I didn't mean to.""

""Who are you?"" A middle aged man  with a giant butt-chin appears from the crowd of martial artists.

WOW!!! Look at all these people! And they ALL know how to fight! Wow this will surely reignite my passion!

""I am Can't-Lose Man! And i want to fight someone so strong that he will reignite my passion for fighting!""

""Are you mental? Are you on drugs?""

""Uuugh no.""

""Well I would've told you to leave but you broke my door. And none breaks my door and gets away with it!"" The middle aged man leaps 15 meters into the air at me.

To tell you the truth he was too slow it was too easy to dodge. He he lands he immediately tries to throw a roundhouse kick at me. I dodge it again. I dodge every single one of his attacks as he tries to hit me.

I duck hit lead hand punch and uppercut him in his giant butt-chin. I was expecting him to fall in the floor but to me surprise he doesn't budge.

""At this academy we perfect the art of Butt-Chin-Fu. A little hit like this means nothing to my butt-chin!""

He punches me in my chin! WOW! Now this is fun! That actually hurt! Show me more! I want to feel more pain! Come on fight MEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!

I throw one more punch at his butt-chin this time It's at 40%. His butt-chin turns into a regular chin from the impact as he couches up blood from his mouth. He was blasted into the ceiling of the club. He came back down unconscious.

Is that it? It was so boring! Maybe he wasn't the leader.

""Come on who else wants to fight me!""

All the other martial artists shriek like little girls as the all run away from me. Looks like I still didn't find that person. I walk out of the club sad.

Before I leave a teenage boy run after me.

""Wait!""
""What do you want?""
""I saw what you did to Sensie Buttchan! Please accept me as your disciple!""
""Sorry kid I fly solo.""
""Please!""
""No.""
""PLEASE!!!""
""Go away.""

I walk away back to my apartment sad (like usual). But something in my mind keeps lingering. That night I had a dream that I will be this boy's teacher. Nah, it's just dream there's no way.

It all goes back to a terribly cold winter a long, long time ago...


When Caesar went to the germanic tribes and informed them that they could not eat pigs any more under the new religious laws, the Germanic wise men replied that they would give up pork only after he cleared a final ceremonious plate of bacon and then made an official proclamation as a symbolic gesture for all of their people to recognize as ""the end of pork."" He cleared the plate, but upon having done so, he refused to go through with the ceremonious rite. 


The true orthodox senators got together and had Caesar assassinated and replaced him with a New Caesar, but alas, the Germanic Tribes merely repeated their demands and upon finishing the plate, this New Caesar too refused to finish the rite. The Orthodox would have assassinated this New Caesar too, but alas, for them, it was December, the month in which they were not allowed to kill any Caesers, so they sent an emissary to the Germanic tribes pleading that they would retire their request and simply give up pork anyway. 


The Germanic Tribes replied, ""well, what are you going to give us for it?"" The Clerics retorted by sending a real to life Nativity scene, [which the Germanic tribes mistook as a hovel of immigrant refugees], a band of minstrels to play Christmas carols, and a holy hand grenade. The Germanic tribes replied by returning the super drunk minstrels singing only ""O Tanambaum!"" along with a huge pile of bundles wrapped in shiny colored wrappings, pine trees covered in candles, spiral cut ham soaked in glaze, kielbasa and enough of bacon for the whole senate while wishing them a happy holiday. 


The clerics were confused of course, and asked them just where all of this crap was coming from, since it was clearly not in their holy books, to which the Germanic tribes replied, ""what book?""  The Clerics said ""You know, Your T.O.s!"" to which the Germanic tribes replied ""there's a Technical Order for this Bull Crap??"" and upon being shown the book, replied ""Oh, we only read German, and sometimes that demotic American language the English named after themselves"" [To which the Scottish, the Welsh, and the Irish all retorted ""WE'RE NOT ENGLISH!"", but never mind them!] and then Caesar added ""heh, I read it, bits and parts, but it's all Greek to me."" The Clerics were mostly confused and quite bemused, because at that point Everybody could read, write, sing, sleep and even eat Greek.   


But they decided they simply needed to try harder, and soon, they were at their wits end, because they couldn't figure out how to translate their holy book into something the German people might read [they tried three translations, of course, but the first was full of words so complicated that the Germans stared blankly back for hours, the second was so dry that it put the Germans to sleep, and the third got lost in translation altogether.


The Clerics, at their wits end trying to reconcile this matter of differences, went to the senate for help, to which Caesar retorted ""Then maybe we should consult an Oracle, or a Sage, or...Siri?"" The Clerics immediately said ""NO ORACLES!"" [but not because they violate the New Holy Book, not being of the Christian religion and all as one might expect their objection to be, but because the last time they consulted an Oracle, they ended up with a King who killed his father and married his mother and they really, really, REALLY wished to avoid that whole bloody Fucked up affair if they could. This left the Sages and Siri, but alas, it being winter, Sage was out of season, and they were about 2000 years too early to consult Siri. 


Finally, when all seemed lost, the clerics and the senators and Caesar alighted upon the fact that they were all the smartest people in the village, so that meant what they needed was the village idiot, someone so simple and autistically asbergerish as to see what they might have overlooked.  The village idiot wasn’t too hard to find, luckily enough; they simply had to put a plate of glass in the village square and wait for someone to come along and try licking it, which happened way too quick and soon they had to take down the glass in fear that they might be overrun with idiot candidates or that the whole village might turn out to be idiots, which was very well possible because of all the lead in their diets due to the lead pipes that delivered the town drinking water.  


The head idiot, though, luckily enough was rather good at reading the word of the Good Book, and after speed reading it like a good Christian cherry picker on a holy book Sundae at an Atheist debate rally, he promptly closed the book and replied “Doesn’t apply.”  “HUH????” said the entire crowd, to which he clarified: “Well, you see here, this section here applies only if you’re in Canaan, well, actually, just to the people in Canaan, and we’re not in Canaan, now are we?”  This made sense to all but one Cleric, who replied “Where the Fuck is Canaan?”  To which the idiot pointed out that it was anywhere near where Jews use Salem might be, to say hello and goodbye and peace ahem, around Jerusalem.  


The entirety of Europe cheered when they found this out, and they promptly declared every week in January the Holy Bacon Fest to celebrate their great divine favor in being granted moral access to the heavenly gift of bacon, pork loin, keilbasa, ham, bratwurst, and pepperoni, which they all found went great on flatbread if accompanied with a little cheese; to expand their supplies, they went so far as to confiscate every bit of it from Canaan, telling the unwashed gentiles that they were just pig out of luck and they should have moved to Rome when they had a chance.  


And all was well, except you may remember that Holy Hand Grenade.  Well, that was put in a closet for a great long while where it was forgotten for many, many, many years, and then one day when little Tommy Oppenheimer was packing everything to escape to America ahead of the Nazi Incursion, he just so happened to take it with him and the rest is history or heresy, be it told by a man or a woman...",On Why Christians Eat Pork [while Jews Do Not],0

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?

the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car.

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,

We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later,

The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks again accept him, feed him, even fix his car.

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles When you find these numbers,

you will become a monk.

The man sets about his task.

Some years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,

I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are

145,236,284,232 blades of grass and

231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk.

We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says,

The sound is right behind that door.

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key?

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire,

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,

silver,

topaz,

and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know end.

He unlocks the door,

turns the knob,

and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound

She calls over an employee and points to the marked-down price.

""I'd like to buy this television,"" she says, batting her eyelashes.

""I'm truly very sorry, miss,"" the employee tells her, ""but blondes are actually not allowed in our store.""

""What kind of store doesn't allow blondes?!"" the woman demands.

The employee shrugs. ""The kind that only exists in jokes like this, I suppose.""

""What?""

""Never mind,"" answers the employee. ""You'll have to leave.""

Frustrated and annoyed, the blonde woman visits her local hair salon and requests a brunette dye-job. Once it's finished, she returns to the store, walks directly to the advertised sale, and flags down the employee from before.

""Excuse me,"" she says, offering a sweet smile. ""I would like to buy this television.""

The employee rolls her eyes and sighs. ""Most of the folks reading this were picturing me as a man until just now.""

""*What?*"" the blonde woman demands.

""Don't worry about it,"" the employee answers. ""What's important is that blondes aren't allowed in this store. You were told this previously, and dying your hair isn't going to change that.""

The blonde woman storms from the store, thoroughly irritated... but unwilling to lose. She decides to book an appointment with a plastic surgeon that very afternoon, and she tells the doctor that she wants a completely new face.

""By the way,"" the blonde woman asks the doctor, ""are you a woman, by chance?""

""No, why?"" the doctor asks.

""I was just checking.""

After several weeks of healing, the blonde woman - now with an entirely altered appearance - revisits the department store. She is delighted to see that the sale is still going on, and she immediately catches the eye of the employee who had kicked her out.

""Hello!"" the blonde woman says. ""I want to buy this television!""

The employee squints her eyes, cocks her head, and purses her lips. ""I'm sorry, miss,"" she replies, ""but we *do not* allow blondes in here.""

""Now, wait just a second!"" the blonde woman shouts. ""I dyed my hair, changed my clothes...""

""The joke didn't mention that part,"" the employee interrupts.

post,41b9bm,2qh72,jokes,false,1452992261,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/41b9bm/the_abominable_night/,self.jokes,,"This joke takes place in a regular September night, somewhere in a city. 

*A black cat with a little white spot on the neck is sitting on a stonewall, slowly swaying her tail from side to side. Her eyes are focused on a man walking across the street.*

He enters the pub. Rather sad looking he takes a seat at the counter and orders two double whiskies. As soon as they arrive, he pours them down and orders the next. 

*If the cat outside had the possibility and and the necessary desire to see what was happening inside the pub, she would have witnessed this scenario over and over again for quite some time. But she didn’t.*

Meanwhile in the bar, a woman approaches the man. She sits down next to him and starts talking. Her name is quite interesting and strange sounding, but irrelevant for the sake of this joke. 

The two share a few words, compliments and shots and leave the bar. They go to his place and straight into the bedroom. Slowly the door closes behind them, leaving nothing in the hallway but the reflection of the moonlight on the floor, and some rhythmic noises coming through the door. 
___

A few hours pass. 
___

*Outside, the cat has come to a decision. After stretching herself just long enough, she jumps from the wall and ambles towards the big tree. She hears the water splashing from behind the tree, coming from a small river. And behind that river, she had seen another big tree. If her observations turn out to be correct, the branches of the two trees should at one point be close enough to go for the jump.*

The man slowly wakes up. He starts to remember that he brought a woman home last night and turns over to her side. Gasping. The sheer look of horror. Everything. Covered. In. Blood. *“I must have killed her!”* he thinks to himself. He rushes into the living room and looks into his safe where his pistol and bullets are stored. But everything is where it is supposed to be. *“How?”* he asks himself, running into the kitchen to check on his Asian knife collection. But like in the safe, everything is there - clean and not bloody. 

He tumbles towards the bathroom, where he sees himself in the mirror. Gasping. He is shocked. With the sudden realization dizziness comes over him. *“Dear Lord..”*, he’s stuttering, *“I must have eaten her.”*.

*Outside, the cat has reached the furthest branch of the tree on her side. Standing here, ready to jump, the distance to the other tree suddenly appears farther. But she had come so far, why stop now. She takes a deep breath and jumps. Unfortunately she doesn’t make it, so she falls down into the water.*

tl;dr: Long foreplay, wet pussy. [8]

Being a confused 8 year old boy who had never heard these slurs before, he asked his parents about their meaning, and the parents, not wanting to teach their kid curses at such a young age, told him that they meant 'ladies' and 'gentlemen,' respectively.

The next day, the parents are busy engaging in rough, sensual coitus, with the kid, of course, eavesdropping. The mother yells ""give me your dick!"" and the father replies ""your pussy feels so soft!"" The child inquired as to what these words mean post-intercourse, and the parents, unbeknownst to them that the boy eavesdropped, casually told him that they meant 'hats' and 'coats.'

The next day was thanksgiving, so the mother was preparing a turkey, she was cutting open the turkey when she accidentaly cut herself, so she, of course, yelled out 'FUCK!' The curious boy once again asked what this word meant, and the mother replied that it was the act of stuffing the turkey. Soon, the boy went upstairs to use the bathroom, and the father was there shaving his beard when he accidentally cut himself as well, so he naturally yelled out 'SHIT!' You can guess what the boy asked, and the father replied that it meant the shaving cream around his face.

An hour later, guests arrived outside and the kid went to answer the door. Upon seeing the guests, he greeted them the best way he knew how.
""Hello bitches and assholes! Put your dicks and pussys in the living room, my parents will see you shortly, my mom is busy fucking the turkey and my dad is wiping the shit off his face!""",One day...,56

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.
