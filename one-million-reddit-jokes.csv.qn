""I'm sorry, sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I'll smell it and order from there.""

A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him.
The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath.   
""Ah, yes, that's what I'll have — meatloaf and mashed potatoes.""    
Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen.   The cook happens to be the owner's wife. He tells her what had just happened.    
The blind man eats his meal and leaves.

Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again.
""Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man.""
""I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork.""    
The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man.    

After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great. I'll take the macaroni and cheese.""   
Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him.    
The blind man eats and leaves.

He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen.
He tells his wife, ""Amelia, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.""

Amelia complies and hands her husband the fork. As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting.

""Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.""

society, he had never been taught the old secrets.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather
was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he
replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to
be cold and that the members of the village should collect
firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got
an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National
Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to
be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told
them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,
""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The
Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to
collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going
to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of
the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The teacher completed the lesson and with a few minutes left in the class asked, ""does anyone have any stories with morals that they would like the share?"" Kids hands shot up and the teacher pointed to Suzzy.

 ""My grandfather used to be raise chickens. He sold a bunch of unhatched eggs as chickens but most of them didn't hatch and he lost a lot of money,"" Suzzy began. The teacher nodded, ""and what is the morale of the story?"" ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch!"" replied Suzzy.
  
  The teacher asked for another example, and after sifting through the raised hands, came to call on Timothy. ""Well my Dad was also a chicken farmer, except he sold a bunch of eggs to the grocery store. Dad loaded all the eggs up into a big box, but on the way to the store he hit a big bump and damaged the box. Most of the eggs broke and he lost a pile of money."" Again the teacher asked, ""What's the morale of the story?"" before Timothy said, ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket!""

  ""Ok, we have time for one more story, why don't you go ahead Jonny?"" The teacher beckoned to Jonny. Jonny began, ""Well, my Uncle Ted was a fighter pilot in the Vietnam war. He was on a patrol flight deep in enemy territory when he got shot down. He grabbed everything he could, which included a machete, a machine gun, and a six pack of beer before ejecting."" The classroom was mesmerized, although the teacher began to look uncomfortable. Jonny continued, ""As he was parachuting down, he chugged the six pack. When he landed he was surrounded by a hundred Vietnamese soldiers. He killed the first seventy with the machine gun, twenty with the machete and the last ten with his bare hands!"" The teacher choked out, ""That's a terrible story!"" before Jonny replied, ""Yeah, well the morale of the story is: You don't fuck with my Uncle Ted when he's drunk.""",Little Jonny and Uncle Ted,23

They would hold ice cream eating contests on the weekends that, being in Vegas, would be bet on by the tourists. 

Anyone could sign up to participate in the challenge if they were daring enough. To win, one would have to eat an entire gallon in thirty minutes. If no one was successful at the end, the person who ate the most would be declared the winner instead. 

One weekend, a gentleman decided to come by the Creamery to see about placing a bet after eyeing the evening's contestants. Tonight there were only three of them. The first was a young man in his twenties; built like football player and had been known for competing in other local food challenges. The second contestant, a woman around the same age, was just in town for a bachelorette party and only signed up out of peer pressure from her girlfriends. The last contestant was a student, here on summer vacation with his family, after completing the sixth grade. 

After scoping everyone out, the gentlemen placed his wager along with the other spectators and and local gamblers. 

With the sound of a horn, the challenge began and the contestants were off! Spoonful after spoonful, they gorged themselves. Soon, though, they started to weaken. A stomachache and brain-freeze quickly forced the bachelorette to drop out first. It was down to the footballer and the elementary school graduate. 

It was a fierce back-and-forth race. For a moment, anyway. For that was all the former sixth-grader needed. With a single gulp, he finished off the gallon in record time. The spectators were silenced. The odds were against him; no one thought he could do it. *No one* except the gentleman, that is. 

When he went to collect his winnings, the others all asked him how he knew the kid would win. They wanted to know his secret formula. They hounded him and begged. Finally, after he had finished counting his winnings, he revealed to them…

So there he is at home, taking a shower and preparing for the big night. Opening his closet, he sifts through his clothes and finds his favorite red coat and trousers, but to his immense surprise, his coat lapels have been ravaged by moths, and a big ugly hole has been eaten on the backside of his trousers.

Pissed off, Santa goes to the living room and asks his wife to mend his clothes and iron them for him. ""Stop bothering me Nick, can't you see I am watching my show now? Go fix your clothes yourself!"" exclaims Mrs. Claus and pisses off Santa even further, but he has no choice.

After a brief struggle to patch the damaged clothes and iron them, Santa steps outside to prepare his sleigh. He finds his reindeer properly tied to the sleigh arm, but his elf crew is nowhere to be found. How is he supposed to load his sack with presents and put it on the sleigh all by himself? Cursing behind his bushy beard, Santa furiously looks all over the place for his workers, and in the end manages to find a sole elf, having a smoke outside the toy lab.

""How the fuck do you explain this situation?"" shouts a beetroot-red Santa at the elf. ""Where the hell is everyone? WE HAVE WORK TO DO!""

The elf, unfazed, draws a puff from his cigarette, and calmly replies ""You see, Nick, we had this talk here with the other guys from the lab and we decided we had to create a labor union. You have us working our fingers to the bone every winter, and we don't even get so much as a thank you for our efforts. I am sorry, but we are officially on strike.""

Santa can't believe what he is hearing. ""Is this some kind of fucking joke?"" he screams off the top of his lungs, but the elf pays him no mind. Having no other choice, Santa begins loading the presents on his own, but his sack gets caught on a metal railing on the sleigh, gets ripped apart and the presents get strewn all over the snow. He proceeds to hand-pick the packets one by one and get them all in the sleigh, and goes to his tool shed to have a whiskey, just to take the edge off.

He hasn't even poured half a glass of Jack Daniels, when he sees that his reindeer have chewed through their straps and reins and are prancing off happily into the nearby forest. At this point, he is swearing his fuzzy cap off, as he can't catch a break. A vein could burst in his head at any moment.

Not a second too soon, a knock is heard at the shed door. It's a little angel carrying a tree, who looks puzzled at the angry Santa, and says ""Hey boss, I brought the Christmas tree. Where should I put it?""

One day the poodle starts chasing butterflies and before long, Cuddles discovers that he's lost. Wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch.
The old poodle thinks, 'Oh, oh! I'm in deep doo-doo now!' Noticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap the old poodle exclaims loudly, 'Boy, that was one delicious leopard! I wonder if there are any more around here?'
Hearing this, the young leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. 'Whew!' says the leopard, 'That was close! That old poodle nearly had me!'
Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the old poodle sees him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard.
The young leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, 'Here, monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine!
Now, the old poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and thinks, 'What am I going to do now?', but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old poodle says.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:
""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp,2

Without saying a word the blonde hands him $5. The blonde then asks, “What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?”
Well, the lawyer is puzzled. He takes several hours, looking up everything he can on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gives up and pays the blonde $50

After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, ""If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!"" 
 The word got around and nobody called him that any more. 

Then one day 
 a young girl named Blue Bird forgot and said, ""Good morning, Onestone..."" He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. 

 The word got around that Onestone meant serious business. Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years. Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him and said, ""Good to see you, Onestone..."" 
 Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night...but, Yellow Bird wouldn't die!!!! 

 What is the moral of this story???

He became a kind of unofficial mascot for the town. Well one day, the sheriff noticed him floating still in the river. Upon closer inspection he realized that he'd been run over by a boat. So the hunt began, the townsfolk searching for the owner of the boat who killed their friend.  Eventually they found him and since hitting an endangered species with a boat In Florida is illegal since it is killing an endangered animal the man was charged with a crime. He became the first person in town history to be charged with crimes against Hugh's manatee. ",A small town in Florida,4

“If my best friend died of pneumonia, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, that would be a great loss,” Trump corrects him.

Another shy young child answers:

“If my uncle got hit by a train, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, no, that would be an accident,” Trump replies.

Realizing his predicament, Little Timmy hastily took a pencil out of his drawer and sat down in front of blank paper to begin. 

Although he knew nothing about philosophy, he knew that if he wanted to finish in time, he'd have to start writing and hope that something would come to him as he did. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Plato appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Amazed, Little Timmy listened as stoic Plato started to speak. As philosophers do, Plato spoke at length about his views on the world and Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Plato said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember that for a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories!""

Head swimming, Little Timmy noticed that time had flown by and there were only 10 hours left to write his paper. 

Confident he could still finish in time, he grabbed his pencil to write down what Plato had said to him about man conquering himself. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Descartes appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Startled, Little Timmy listened as the contemplative Descartes started to speak. As philosophers do, Descartes spoke at length about his views on the world and once again, Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Descartes said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember this: I think, therefore I am!""

Still overwhelmed, Little Timmy noticed that more time had flown by and there were only 8 hours left to write his paper. 

Confident he could still finish in time, he grabbed his pencil to write down what Descartes had said to him about existence. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Frederick Nietzsche appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Unbelieving, Little Timmy listened as disparate Nietzsche started to speak. As philosophers do, Nietzsche spoke at length about his views on the world and Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Nietzsche said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember there is no point to anything.""

Deep in introspection, Little Timmy noticed that time had flown by and there were only 4 hours left to write his paper. Little Timmy began to sweat, he had never finished a paper in such little time, but Nietzsche had stuck a chord with him and he had finally decided that the hopeless philosopher would be the subject of the paper. 

Inspired and confident he could finish just in time, Little Timmy grabbed his pencil for the last time to write down what Nietzsche had said to him about there being no point to anything. However, just as he was about to put pencil to paper that final time...

So the doctor decides that he wants his own custom house. So he buys a plot of land. And, seeing the doctor as a smart man, the gypsy does the same. 

Once construction on the houses had begun, the gypsy copied everything the doctor did. The doctor put stones on his house, so did the gypsy. The doctor built an interlock drive way, so did the gypsy. In the end, both had identical houses. 

A few months later, being the flexible person he is, the doctor decides to get his house appraised, and so does the gypsy. 

When the real estate agent asked the doctor how much he thought the house was worth, the doctor immediately said 1 million dollars. And so the real estate agent put up that price. Then the real estate agent asked the Gypsy what he thinks his house is worth, and instantly the Gypsy says 1.2 million dollars. The real estate agent asks the Gypsy why he thinks his house is worth more if they both have the exact same, identical house. And the Gypsy responds ""because who ever buys my house has a doctor for a neighbour, but whoever buys his house gets a Gypsy!"" ",So There's a Gypsy and a Doctor (old Croatian joke),20

From now on, when people approach the gates, ask them what kind of day they had. Only permit them entry if they've had an exceptionally bad day."" Peter shrugged and nodded his head, returning his attention to his magazine. An hour or so later, a man arrived at the gates. Ever diligent, Peter explained the new policy to the man and ask him about his day. ""You wouldn't believe it Peter"", he said. ""I came home early to my fourth-floor apartment to find that my wife had been cheating on me with another man. I tore the house apart looking for the guy, my wife screaming at me all the while. Then I spotted him. He was hanging onto the railing of my balcony by his fingers, so I began stomping them. Eventually he fell, but he survived the fall. In a rage, I pushed the refrigerator from the kitchen to the balcony and over the rails, crushing him. Afterwards, the stress and physical exertion was too much. I died of a heart attack on the spot."" Peter considered it for a moment, and concluded that it was indeed a terrible day. He permitted the man entrance and returned to his magazine. A short while later, another man arrived. Peter again explained the policy and waited for the man's story. ""Well Peter, it's pretty crazy. I was doing my daily aerobics routine on the balcony of my fifth-floor apartment when I slipped on a spot of mildew and fell over the rails. Somehow though, I managed to grab hold of the railing on the next floor down! But before I could pull myself up, the man who lives there came out and started stomping on my hands!  I never had a chance to explain. He'd broken most of my fingers and I wasn't able to hold on anymore. The fall broke several of my bones, but miraculously I was alive! I was just about to say a prayer of thanks when I looked up to see the man pushing a refrigerator over the rails to finish the job! Unable to move from my injuries, I couldn't escape and well, here I am."" Secretly realising the irony of the situation, Peter waved him in, doing his best to stifle a chuckle. Before he could return to his magazine, however he looked up to see that another man had already arrived at the gates. Once again, he explained the new policy and awaited the man's story.

Grover the grocer ran a comfortable business, with one recurring malady--a persistent shoplifter named Gwen. Grover knew she was robbing him blind, but couldn't seem to catch her in the act.

This continued for quite a number of years until, as fortune would have it, one day he caught her redhanded stealing a bag of fresh peaches. Grover gleefully awaited his day in court when at long last he would witness Gwen receive her comeuppance.

Sitting across from Gwen in court, Grover stared smugly, anxious to hear the judge's sentence passed down.

""What is the crime?"" the judge inquired.

""Stealing a bag of peaches, your honor."" Grover replied.

""And how many peaches were in the bag?"" the judge continued.

""Six, your honor."" Grover stammered.

The judge slammed his gavel down and thundered toward Gwen, ""I hereby sentence you to serve one day per item stolen behind bars! I'll see you back here in six days!""

Grover stared incredulously. Six days?! After all the grief and sleepless nights she had caused him? Completely beside himself, he blurted out, ""Your honor, she also stole a can of peas!!""",Grover the Grocer and the Shoplifter,11

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.

While waiting, they start to wonder: Could they get married in Heaven? When St. Peter shows up, they immediately ask him.

St. Peter replies, “I don’t know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out.” He leaves.

The couple sat and waited for St. Peter to return, but he never did. 9 weeks later, and the couple were still waiting. They started to wonder, if things didn’t work out, could they get a divorce in heaven? Another month later, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

“Yes,” he informs the couple. “You can get married in Heaven.”

“Awesome!” the couple responds enthusiastically. “But we were just wondering, what if things don’t work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?”

St. Peter’s face suddenly turned red with anger. He slammed his clipboard to the ground. Frightened, the couple asked “What’s wrong?”

“OH, COME ON!” St. Peter shouted. “It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it’ll take me to find a lawyer?”",Getting married in heaven,131

A rabbi and a Catholic priest are having lunch in a restaurant. The priest's food arrives, a scrumptious-looking ham entrée.

The priest attacks his lunch, savouring every bite of the ham. Noticing the rabbi eyeing him, he asks, ""So tell me, Rabbi Goldblum, have you ever had any pork before?""

The rabbi hesitates. ""Well, it's not for me to say...""

The priest pushes on. ""Oh, c'mon, Rabbi. We're both men of God here. We can tell each other our sins. Nothing to it.""

""Umm... well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did have pork once.""

Smugly the priest teases him, ""And a fine meat it was, wasn't it? Heheh.""

""Yeah, I'll say.""

A few moments pass. The rabbi asks the priest: ""Tell me Father, have you ever had sex with a woman before?""

""Why of course... well, before I took holy orders, that is.""

The rabbi smirks, ""Better than pork, eh?""

Just as he's about to take his first bite, in walks Goldberg, the president of his congregation.

He approaches the old Chinese man behind the counter and pays for the large stuffed rat, but  as he is leaving he swears he can hear the old Chinese man cackling behind him as he leaves. 
     
He begins walking down the street and soon turns down an alley. After a few moments he hears a squeaking sound behind him and turns around, and there, in the middle of the alley is a large rat with glowing red eyes sitting on its hind legs just staring at him.
     
He thinks this is odd, but doesn't think too much about it, and continues on his way. 

After a few moments, he hears more loud squeaking sounds and turns around and sees a dozen rats all sitting on their hind legs staring at him... their red eyes fixated on the large stuffed rat.
     
Now he's very disturbed and he picks up his pace. Soon he hears a cacophony of squeaking and scurrying and glances over his shoulder to see a sea of dozens of rats all running after him.
     
He begins running faster and soon the rats are joined by dozens and dozens more, and soon it's a tidal wave of rats. There are hundreds  upon  hundreds. 

No! Thousands! Thousands of rats are now chasing him. He runs as fast as he can, trying to get away but soon finds himself at the harbor.
     
He turns this way, and that, but he ends up at the end of the pier with nowhere left to go!
     
He sees the rats barreling down the pier toward him now there is easily 500,000 rats in the mob, their red eyes glowing in the dim light and fixated on him. 

Not knowing what else to do he lifts the large stuffed rat above his head and the Rats suddenly stop and sit on their hind legs... staring.

Without thinking he hurls the stuffed rat into the bay, and without hesitation the hundreds of thousands of rats run past him and leapt to their death, all drowning in the bay.
     
With the last rat gone off the end of the pier, the business man makes his way back to the Curiosity Shop. He approaches the old Chinese guy behind the counter...
     
""Did you enjoy your rat?"" He asks, smiling evilly.
     
""Not really... but I think I would like something else."" The businessman says as he pulls out his wallet.

The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the Iranian hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce, which costs quarter of a million dollars.

“The car is parked on the street in front of the bank,” says the Iranian, “and I have all the necessary papers.”

The bank officer agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. After the Iranian leaves, the loan officer, the bank’s president and all their colleagues enjoy a good laugh at the man for using a $250,000 Rolls Royce as collateral against a $5,000 loan.

One of the employees drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the Iranian man returns, repays the $5000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.

The loan officer says, “Sir, I must tell you, we’re all a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and discovered that you’re a multimillionaire. Why would you bother to borrow $5,000?”

The man replies, “Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41?”",Can I get a loan?,356

The bear NEEDS to go, IMMEDIATELY. He finds himself an area, and does his business... he then looks around for a leaf to use so he can wipe himself... He then comes to realize that he's utterly surrounded by poison ivy. ""Aww, Hell,"" says the bear to himself. ""I guess I'll have to either have shit run down my fur or deal with poison ivy on my ass."" 

Then a little rabbit pokes his head out of his den. He looks at the situation and says to the bear, ""Lookin' like you're stranded there buddy""...

The bear kind of chuckles at himself, ""yeah, not the best situation to be in"". An idea then pops into the bears mind.... ""Hey, Rabbit"" the bear calls.. ""Yeah?"" replies the rabbit....

The bear asks, ""You ever have a problem with shit sticking to your fur?""

The rabbit replies, ""Nope, can't say that I have""

The bear, then grabs the rabbit, wipes his ass with him, throws him aside , and goes on his way.

Granted he didn't have a lot of experience, it was a huge stepping stone to what became his future career. His love of comedy was also further enhanced through the discovery of WKUK's comedic shorts. Mixing standup comedy and short films, what a goldmine to be plundered!


After he graduated from college, he worked on multiple films on certain weeks and when he was done, he did standup. Clubs, bars, schools .. etc. Jebediah didn't have to grovel for places to accept his standup routine though. ""Just 10 minutes, free of charge"" Nobody could resist his offer, ""His loss"" they thought, only to then realize he had absolutely zero comic potential. His jokes were atrociously bad, so much so that a woman choked on her drink and died. He was a nomad to his country, moving states whenever he ran out of places who were willing to take him. ""How can I make a comedy short if the comedy aspect is so bad, it even managed to kill someone!"" 


Jebediah Ross was at his wit's end. 


During his travels he met a man in a bar, he was performing in, who called himself Rick. Rick not only found Jeb's jokes hilarious, he was the first person who encouraged Jeb to put his routine in a video. It took a considerable amount of persuasion, liquid or otherwise, but it got him motivated enough to try. Jeb thanked the man and left with broader shoulders, not realizing Rick was just trying to leech drinks off him. It didn't matter though, because Jeb was on his way to make himself a millionaire.

***6 Years later***

""I didn't actually mean it! You need to stop the broadcast now, innocents will die!""

""Well it is too late. Even if your praise wasn't sincere, your advice lit a fire in me that won't stop burning for anything. My passion is in short comedy films. You can't stop me.""

""But why release it on air?! Sell your video to the military, I don't know. Oh god my mum always watches the news at this time! *SHE'S GONNA DIE!*""

""Rick, it's going to be okay. I changed it up, you'll see.""

""How will it be any different? My mother's blood will be on your hands!""

His problem was that he shouted the phrase **“Oh, fuck I missed!”**, every time he missed a shot.

His friends and family who were concerned took him to a priest to see if fear of God could make him stop cursing.

After meeting the hunter, the priest told him that, Swearing is a sin and we as God’s children should not commit them.

So the Archer agreed that swearing needed to stop, hence he requested the priest to go with him the next time he went hunting.

The priest agreed and they both went out the next day to a forest.

The hunter took his first shot and missed. He shouted, **“Oh, fuck I missed!”**

To which the priest warned him, “Son, do not sin. For the lord is watching over you now.”

The hunter apologized and got ready to take his next shot.

He missed and again he shouted even louder **“Oh, fuck I missed!”**

The priest was furious now, he shouted at the hunter with the words “Son, you are making the lord angry. Once more curse word from your mouth and the lord will strike thunder upon you!”

The hunter got scared and with nervousness took his final shot.

Again, he missed.

And again, he shouted **“Oh, fuck I missed!”**

As he finished the sentence, there was a thunder lighting and it hit the priest.

And the priest died.

Trump decided to help the children learn the word ‘tragedy’, and asked the following question to them:

“What would be a tragedy, kids?”

A bespectacled boy nervously answers:

“If my best friend died of pneumonia, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, that would be a great loss,” Trump corrects him.

Another shy young child answers:

“If my uncle got hit by a train, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, no, that would be an accident,” Trump replies.

A young girl raises her hand. The wealthy businessman asks her if she’d like to give an example of a tragedy. The girl nods, and says:

“If Mr. Trump was in his private jet, and a missile hit the jet, that would be a tragedy.”

“Yes, that would be a tragedy for sure. Can you tell me why?” The businessman asks.
