Poor schmuck was bullied for his name as far back as grade school. Everyone anticipated daily roll call just to hear the teacher call out his name and burst in uncontrolled laughter. Even the teachers giggled. It didn't end after school, he joined the army hoping it would increase his confidence, but guess what they used to call him all through out boot camp? Matters only worsened later in his life. He could never get past the first date, no woman wanted someone with that name. Mockery turned to loneliness, loneliness to depression. Depressed through his twenties, he realised that unless he makes a change, nothing will ever come his way no matter how hard he tries. So, at the ripe age of 30 he decided to start over, get another chance at life, so he legally changed his name to Andrew.",Did you hear the story about Joe Shitter?,36

The Germans had an emergency meeting. They thought they could come back from the heavy losses using the same tactics as the Americans. Thus, a German asked, ""What is a popular American name?""

Frustrated, she submitted a complaint to the website that the steps were incorrect, and demanded they update their steps. The website did. The new steps are if you stopped all contraception for months, ate healthy, exercised, went to the doctor to inspect for fertility, find a fertile male, have unprotected sex 2 days before ovulation, and lifted your legs after having sex, you will become pregnant. So she did.

One month later, she was still not pregnant. She again filed a complaint to the website, saying that their steps are erroneous. The website admins clarified that the chances to get pregnant was actually less than 100%, and that they failed to mention it. They recommended to try it 10 times.

In christening services, where babies are dedicated to the Church, parents and godparents are asked to make some oaths:

“Do you reject Satan and all his works?”
“I do”
“And all his empty promises?”
“I do”, and so on.

Now it happened that one morning a priest noticed an old lady in the pews was bowing her head every time she heard “Satan”. Surprised by this, he waited until the service was over and approached her. 

“I couldn’t help notice, madam, that you bowed your head, not just for the name of Jesus, but for Satan as well”

The lady smiled and replied, “Yes, father. You see, I am very old. I could go at any time.”

“But why Satan?” The priest went on.

“Well father, politeness costs nothing, and you never know...”",Old Custom In Ireland,7

The bar owner looks at him and hesitantly says, “Sure, whenever you’re ready.” The drunk man sits at the piano and plays a great, fun, complex piece on the piano. When he’s done the bar owner says, “hey, that was actually really good. what song was that?” The drunk man answers, “it’s a song I wrote. I call it ‘Your mother’s a whore.” The bar owner is a little taken back but decides the song was so good he’d let it go. He asks the drunk man to play another one. And he continues to play the most beautiful song the bar owner had ever heard. When the song finished the bar owner wipes a tear from his eye and says, “that was one of the best songs ive ever heard on the piano, did you write that one too?” The drunk man replies, “sure did. That one’s called, ‘fuck you, and suck my dick.’” The bar owner again is surprised but decides to give the drunk the job on the condition he doesn’t announce any of the names of the songs. 

So the next week the man is playing his first gig, playing all of his songs, but not announcing any of the names. The crowd is loving every second of it and everyone’s buying drinks. It was on of the best nights the bar had ever had! The piano player is drunk again at this point and announces he’s gonna take a quick bathroom break. So he stumbles on his way to the bathroom and comes out 5 minutes later with his pants down. Another man at the bar sees him and says, “excuse me sir, do you know your pants are down, and your dick is out?” And the drunk piano player scoffs, and replies, “Do I know it?? I wrote it!”","A bar is holding open auditions for a new piano player,",99

The old doctor brings him into the examining room, leans in, and looks at his toe. After a few minutes of examination, he begins to laugh.

""What's wrong?"" the young man asks.

""Well,"" the doctor giggles, ""you're not gonna believe this, but it looks like you have a yeast infection on your big toe!""

The young man begins to laugh himself. ""Boy Doc,"" he says, ""I bet that's the weirdest thing you've seen in this office!""

As she wandered down the path, she ended up at their house, signed ""The Three Bears"". 
She didn't see any sign of them around.

Typical.

Yet, some things were different now. They had a porch, an attic, and a massive garage. It seemed fairly old, so they must have got it all done soon after she'd first come to visit. 

She wandered around their garden for a bit before she was greeted by a middle aged Japanese man. He seemed to be wearing attire meant for gardening. 

She asked him what he was doing there, and out of his mouth came some broken english, ""I... do work... for bears."" all while he gestured exaggeratedly. 

She didn't want to fluster him any more than sge already had, so she decided to calm him down and asked him where they were. He seemed to have no idea, to what she could gather, so she asked him if he'd show her around. 

He seemed to understand every word she said, and affirmed accordingly before pointing to the door.

""I'd like to see the garage, please. I want to see what kind of cars bears would drive."" she smirked. Agreeing excitedly, he led her to the garage, before opening it to reveal three cars in the dark. He fumbled for the lights, and as they came on, three Nissans distinctly lay before her.
Raising an eyebrow, she examined the cars from a distance. One was blue, another, a deep red, and the final one was caked in dust. 

""Nissans, huh. That's not what I would have expected. But then again, what other bears do I know who can drive."" she thought to herself. 
The number plates seemed slightly faded, but there were things distinctly written on them. 

""Do they have names?"" she shot in the dark, not knowing how else to ask what they said without being awkward. ""Yes! Name... I name cars... bear ask me... give name."" the man's enthusiasm and pride knew no bound now, she could see. 

""Oh really, what are they called?"" 

""They are... uh... number... like 1... 2... 3...""

""One, Two, and Three?"" she pointed at the blue, red, and dusty one from right to left. 

""Oh no! No... Japanese numbers... icchi... nii... san..."" 

""So, Icchi, Nii, and San then?"" 

""No! No. Number like... Icchi... Icchi Ni...""

""So, one, one two, and one two three. Huh. Nice."" she cut him off, feeling like the conversation was getting a tad bit repetitive.

She walked closer to the cars, noticing how each one was decorated to fit a designated driver. 

The red car was definitely Daddy Bear's, with all that flannel and the axes in the back seat. 

Baby Bear's car was the blue one, completely modded to be as loud as possible. The tacky fuzzy dice didn't help. 

""Why's this one covered in dust? Hasn't been used in a bit, huh."" she saw what seemed to be Mama Bear's car. 

""Oh, that car bad car. Car have insect."" he said, concerned. 

""Insects? Ew. What kind of insects?"" 

""Small... black... bite. Uh.... flea! Yes, flea!"" 

""Fleas? How bad could it possibly be that you don't use a car again?"" she whispered to herself. ""Couldn't you get it cleaned?"" 

""I try. Mama Bear say no. Say that name fit now.""

""The name fits now? How?""

""YES!!"" Another exclaimed! ""We can not only dismantle their social construct but we can all attack and receive our gifts of 72 virgins in the afterlife!!"" 

Months of planning go into the attack. They learn programming, coding, and they study western culture so they can fit in unnoticed for the attack.

The day comes. July 4th. The attack will happen at 12pm.

They all are granted a tour of the headquarters claiming to be a small technology company looking to learn how to build up their business.  They get to know some of the employees and learn about their lives outside of work. Trying to remember faces as they feel smug on the inside knowing what they are about to do.

After about two hours into the tour they are allowed a 20 minute restroom and smoke break.

They take their positions. Their leader gives them all the signal in their ear pieces. BOOM.

The whole building is destroyed. No one survives.

Slowly one by one as the terrorists open their eyes they are all blinded by an extremely bright white light. After a few minutes their eyes adjust and they are taking in their surroundings.  The afterlife.  Bright skies and a floor feeling like clouds. Their leader takes them to a gateway which is where they will meet their 72 virgins each. He opens the door slowly so they can embrace what they are about to view.

*GASP* one of the terrorists utters.

""What is this shit??"" They all start yelling at their leader.

Besides, the BULL was quick and surrender, he did not forgive any cow that would pass him by, and it seemed that he would never tire of begetting.  One day, the farmers gathered and they decided to buy the bull to not depend more on Don Alejo.  

A representative went and said:  “Put a price on your bull that we are going to buy” 

 The farmer, who did not want to lose his source of income, asked for an absurd number to be rejected.  

The farmers complained to the Mayor about the price of the animal, and he, sensitized with the problem, bought the bull with municipal funds, registering it as MUNICIPAL HERITAGE and putting it at the service of the entire community.  

On the day of the inauguration of the services, the farmers brought their cows for the bull to prey. They put the first one, and nothing.  ""It must be the cow - said one - is very skinny.""  They brought her a great Dutch champion, the bull sniffed her, and nothing!  

They passed the entire rodeo, but The bull did not flinch!  The Mayor, furious, called the former owner and rebuked him to solve the problem ...  

He had spent the taxpayers' money and didn't want to think it was all another scam.

Not daring to look back, he quickened his pace. But, the bumping noise continued behind him.He stopped and turned to see what it was. Coming down the road behind him was a coffin, standing on end, bumping from side to side -

BUMP,

BUMP,

BUMP.

The man, terrified for his life, turned and started running. Behind him, the coffin came faster

BUMP,

BUMP,

BUMP!

Ahead of him, there was a branch that had fallen from a tree. He reached down and grabbed it as he ran by. Still running, he turned and threw it over his shoulder at the coffin - but it just splintered when it hit the coffin and the coffin continued coming faster

BUMPITY BUMP,

BUMPITY BUMP,

BUMPITY BUMP!

The man turned the corner onto his street and ran through his front gate, the coffin right behind him. His splitting axe was resting against his woodpile so he snagged it, turned, and gave a mighty two-handed throw sending it end over end right at the coffin.

SMASH! -

The axe shattered on the unnaturally strong wood of the coffin and it continued after him.The man dashed in his house, but the coffin crashed through the front door. The man ran upstairs and grabbed his shotgun off the wall display.

He blasted the coffin with both barrels, but the shot bounced harmlessly off the coffin as it continued up the stairs

BUMP,

CLOMP,

BUMP,

CLOMP!

The man, desperate and scared to death, jumped into the bathroom and locked the door - knowing it would do no good. The coffin Banged against the door, once ..., twice ..., and on the third time, the door exploded and the coffin came forward.

In desperation the man reached out his hand and grabbed whatever he could. All that was there was a bottle of cough syrup so he threw it at the coffin.

The bottle shattered, cough syrup covered the coffin from top to bottom

and the coffin stopped...","One rainy, windy night, a man was walking home alone, down a dark, deserted street that ran right by the local cemetery.",64

Recently retired, it was his dream to continue his legacy by teaching his son the art of swimming.  They had practiced for years, and when Michael's son was ready, he was entered into his first ever tournament.  
  
The first round was easy.  After all, the son had been training for years, and had the best coach in the nation.  But, by the time things progressed to the quarterfinals, his times didn't look good.  Michael's son was in dead last.  
  
""Dad, I don't think I'm going to win this one.  I'm sorry."" he said.  
  
""Have no fear, son.  I swam in tournaments for years.  I know a few tricks."" replied Michael.
  
""Tricks? Like cheating?"" inquired the son.  
  
""No, nothing like that."" said Michael.  ""It's all about aerodynamics.  For example, your swim trunks are medium sized.  Go into the locker room and change into a small.  You'll be more streamlined and go faster.""  
  
The boy did as instructed, and proceeded to the quarterfinals.  The gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was able to advance to the semifinals... but only, just barely.  
  
""Well, Dad, I think that helped, but I think I'm doomed.  Even with the extra speed, I can never win the semifinals"".  
  
""Son, I know another trick.  It's all about aerodynamics.  Your noseplugs-- they're too big.  Switch your current ones out for a smaller size.  It will reduce the drag on your face in the water and give you a little speed boost.""  
  
Again, the boy did as he was told, proceeding to the semifinals with smaller nose plugs.  Once again, the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was surprised to find that he was able to advance to the finals... but only, just barely.  
  
""Dad, thank you for all you've done for me.  But, I think I'm doomed.  There's no way I can win now.  I think we're all out of tricks.""  
  
""Not so, son.  I have one last trick.  It's all about aerodynamics.  You wear a size medium swimming cap.  Take it off and wear a smaller size.  It will make you more streamlined and get your blood flowing better.  If you do this, you have a really good chance of winning.""  
  
The boy did as instructed.  Once again, the gun went off.  The final race began.  The son started out with a massive lead, but then, something unexpected happened.  The son made it halfway through the pool when he unexpectedly started rolling sideways, and then started bobbing up and down like a cork in the water.  
  
""Oh no!"" Michael said.  ""Capsize!""","In Celebration of my Cake Day, here's a terrible joke: the Olympic Swimmer and his Son",36

But the desire to impress my friends and family by proving to them that I could ride a horse outweighed my fear.

So I got on the horse.

And then it happened.  The horse just started pitching furiously.  It bucked me backward and forward, up and down.  I was terrified.  I screamed.  And as I screamed, more and more people began to watch.

All I could do in this moment of terror was to grip the saddle horn with both hands as hard as I could.  I feared falling off the horse and possibly breaking my neck.  I knew I had to do whatever it took to stay on that horse.

My screaming turned to a frantic crying and whaling as I knew I might not survive this experience.  More and more people started to watch.

Alas, the violent bucking of the horse started to cause me to slide off of its side.  But as I was sliding off, I quickly put one arm around the horse's neck and held on to his head with the other as the rest of my body slid off to the side.  I hung on for dear life as the horse continued to buck. I screamed and yelled, ""HELP! HELP!""

I knew I was a goner as I didn't know how much longer I could hold on. Many thoughts were racing through my head.  My life was flashing before me.  I hung on as hard as I could as I screamed and cried at the top of my lungs.

But as all hope of survival was fading and my arms were about to give out, a miracle happened!  A very brave grocery store clerk ran over to the outlet and unplugged the kiddie ride just in time.  I was saved.",I was nervous as I approached the horse that I was about to ride.,0

Fans were so overheated that some games were cancelled and militia and army forces were used to restore order. There were many games, with victories and defeats for both teams, but the story is about 1966 when Armenians won 1:0. Soon after that Georgian team ""Ararat"" won Armenians 5:0. All of goals were scored by one forward - Ilya Datunashvili. The victory was so overwhelming that republic went to unofficial holidays. 

Back that days, a guide is leading a group of tourists through Tbilisi showing them an ancient part of the town. They are walking the bridge across Kura river when guide stops. 

\- As you may know Georgian football team won an epic victory against Armenian team recently. It was 5:0 and all of it was scored by the single greatest player - Datunashvili. People of Georgia were so grateful to him that we built two statues in his honor. Look to your right (pointing at ""Mother Kartli"" statue). It's Danutashvili's mother. Now look to the left (pointing at Vakhtang I Gorgasali, King of Eastern Georgia in 439-522). It's Danutashvili's father. Now you see, his right hand is up and he is showing us his open palm with five fingers up? That's the number of goals scored by his son.",A heartwarming joke from Georgia,3
