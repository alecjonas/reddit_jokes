One day he wanted to show his friend Jill that he was living well off without him. So he goes to Village invites Jill to come over to the city to visit him. So he shows Jill everything and taunts him how Jill cannot afford them. Later he goes to drop Jill in his Village. Jill then suggests they both should go to the well, just like their childhood. Jack agrees to that. They go to the well spend some time. After they start their journey back the well starts to speak. It says it was a wishing well all along and says it used to be happy every time they both used to come here and play. It says that wishing wells have a limit of wishes to give before they turn into a normal well. It offers the friends the last wish it has. Jack being a douche says to Jill ""I may not come to this bloody village again. I'll take the wish and will ask an iPhone for you for contacting me as it will take you a lifetime to buy one for yourself"". Jill gets hurt and as soon as Jack starts wishing Jill at the same time wishes ""I hope Jack disappears"" with tears in his eyes.

Whereas the party of the first part, who will be henceforth be addressed as 'the lawyers' and the party of the second part, henceforth addressed as 'the light bulb' do hereby agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (light bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.


The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:


The party of the first part (lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light bulb) in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable.

The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.


Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.


Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part ('new light bulb'). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact actually becomes the party of the second part (light bulb).


NB: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do so with the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as 'The Firm'.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living,2446

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job...,0

On that special day, they'd each walked across the lake to the pub on the far side for their first legal drink. 

So when Paddy's, 18th birthday came around, he and his pal Mick, took a boat out to the middle of the lake, Paddy, stepped out of the boat ... and nearly drowned! 

Mick just barely managed to pull him back into the boat and safety. 

Furious and confused, Paddy, went to see his grandmother. 

'Grandma,' he asked, ""Tis me 18th birthday, so why can't I walk 'cross the lake like me farder, his farder, and his farder before him?"" 

Granny looked deeply into Paddy's, troubled brown eyes and said, ""Because ye farder, ye grandfarder and ye great-grandfarder were all born in January, when the lake is frozen, and ye were born in August, ya bloody idiot!""

In order to satisfy her needs while he is away, he goes browsing in a sex toy shop to find something special for her.

""Sir, I need a toy that will satisfy my wife, who has an incredible sex drive."" Says the man. The store owner says ""I have just the thing.""  He pulls out a glowing box from underneath the counter. He opens it up and inside is a dildo that has a mysterious glow around it. The store owner says ""watch this.""  He looks at the dildo and says ""voodoo dick! The keyhole!"" The dildo magically rises up out of the box and flies over to the keyhole and furiously penetrates it back and forth.

The man, amazed, must have it. He gives the store owner his credit card as the store owner puts the dildo back into the box.  

The man brings it home for his wife and demonstrates on the keyhole the same way the store owner did. His wife is delighted and he grabs his bags and leaves for his trip.

Later that night, his wife decides to use it. She takes out the box and opens it. ""Voodoo dick! My pussy!"" The dildo magically rises up and begins to penetrate her back and forth. She screams with pleasure for hours until she can't take anymore. She tries to remove it but the magically voodoo dick is too powerful. She panics and decides to drive to the sex toy store to figure out how to stop it.

While she's driving, the voodoo dick hasn't stopped. It is still going wild on her. She is swerving and speeding completely out of control. She sees lights behind her and pulls over to the side of the road. A police officer approaches her window and asks ""mam, have you been drinking tonight?"" She says ""no, officer! I have this voodoo dick inside of me!""  He responds ""yeah. Voodoo dick, my ass.""

But there's a huge line at the store to even get fitted for a tuxedo. He thinks he is done. But there is a lengthy line at the store to pick out his bowtie and cumber bun. He’s done with all his selections and is ready to leave. But there is an enormous check out line. Finally he gets out of there and realizes he has to go buy a corsage, so he goes to a florist. But there's this big long corsage line at the florist. Now he's gotta go rent a limo. But there's this huge line when he gets to the limo place. 

Finally after waiting and making all the arrangements, it's the night of the prom. He has to go to the tux shop to pick up his tux. But there is a super long pick up your tux line. Then he has to go to the florist to pick up the corsage. But there is a long corsage line too. He gets the corsage and has his tux and rushes home to get ready. But there is a line to use the bathroom mirror since his sister is also getting ready to go to the prom.
The limo arrives and he hops in to go get his date. He picks her up and head to the prom. But there's this huge ticket line at the door. When they get past the ticket line they are immediately funneled into a massive picture line. Finally they get in and they start dancing and having fun, and she says to him, ""I'm hungry,"" so he goes to get her some food, but there's this huge buffet line. He gets her some food and they eat and they're dancing again and she says, ""Now I'm thirsty, can you get me a drink?"" So he goes to get her a drink and there's no punchline.

""Five miles west, there's a butcher shop. The owner deals with meat, he should have a rather precise scale. You could just put your baby on the meat scale, and the weight reading you'll get should be pretty accurate.""

And so the father departed westward. After much walking, with his newborn child cardled safely in his arms, he finally arrived at the butcher shop. He explained his dilemma to the shop owner, to witch the latter replied:

""Don't worry, friend. It's not even a problem, I'll check it for you, free of charge."" And so he took the child to the back, where the scale was located.

The father heard rumbling noises, and some scraping.. About a minute later the butcher came back.

A billionaire throws a party for the whole town. He has everything a billionaire could possibly have including: tennis courts, go cart track, mini-golf, private airplane, and a huge mansion. The main attraction however is the biggest swimming pool you've ever seen, and inside that pool, the worlds biggest alligator.


At the end of the party he makes a announcement, 'Before everyone leaves Id like to make a challenge, Whoever can swim across my swimming pool without getting eaten by the alligator can have one of three things. (1. A billion dollars) (2. Half my estate) (or 3. My daughters hand in marriage). No one however has the guts to do so and the party ends and everyone goes home.


The very next year he throws another party's just like the first and at the very end he challenges someone to the same challenge as before. However no one has the guts the 2nd year either and everyone leaves.


The third year comes and he decides to throw one more party, and at the end of the party he gives his challenge one more time. Just as he is finishing saying what he will give the lucky guy who can swim across, He hears a splash of someone jumping in. He looks over to see this guy swimming as fast as he possibly can across the pool with the alligator chasing after him. Everyone in town is cheering him on as the alligator is snapping it's jaw at his feet. The man reaches the end of the pool and 3 men pull him up as the alligator snaps his shoe off.


The billionaire rushes over and he exclaims, 'THAT WAS THE BRAVESET THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! Which choice do you want out of the three?!?! The man is breathing so heavily he can't speak. The bilionare asks, 'Do you want a billion dollars?' The man replies with heavy breathing 'No no No'. The billionaire responds with 'You're a smart man you must want half my estate'. The man replies with heavy breathing still 'No No gasp No'. The billionaire goes 'Ok you are even smarter than I thought. You may have my daughters hand in marriage.' The man replies still breathing heavily 'No No I don't want your daughter'. The billionaire now confused asks 'Than what do you possibly want?!?!?!' The man replies back with, 'I, I just want the na, name of the gu, guy who pushed me in.",Billionaire throws a party for the whole town,163

It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay.

Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those headaches once a day.

Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Dept. and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

Yes, mother and dad, I am pregnant. I know how very much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily.

I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know that your oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told his father is an important gunbearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you there was no dormitory fire; I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture; I was not in the hospital; I am not pregnant; I am not engaged. I do not have syphillis, and there is no Negro in my life. However, I am getting a D in sociology and an F in science; and I wanted you to see these marks in proper perspective.

Your loving daughter, ",A Daughter writes a letter to home,16

The song ends and Boudreaux tells the girl:
""I really enjoyed dancing with you and by the way I love your red lace panties.""

The boy coughs up 2 of the nickels, but keeps choking. Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, attractive, and serious looking woman in a blue business suit is reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly. After a few seconds, the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last nickel, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.

Releasing the boy's testicles, the woman hands the nickel to the father and walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word.

As he was hiking, he noticed an elephant in the distance that had its foot hovering in the air. Not wanting to startle the creature, Joseph slowly made his way toward the elephant. When he got close to the elephant, he noticed a large splinter of wood sticking out from the elephant's foot. Acting carefully, Joseph removed the splinter with his knife. After successfully removing it, the elephant looked at him and stomped its foot several times. Joseph stayed still, with the fear of imminent death. After stomping its foot, the elephant trumpeted loudly and walked away. Joe never forgot that day.

Thirty years later, Joseph was with his family at the Tulsa Zoo when an elephant walked up to Joseph's side of the enclosure and stomped its foot several times. Remembering the incident from thirty years ago, Joseph couldn't help but wonder if this was the same elephant.

Mustering all the courage he had, Joseph climbed over the fence and into the enclosure. He walked up to the elephant and held its gaze for several minutes before the elephant trumpeted. The elephant then wrapped its trunk around Joseph, picked him up, and then slammed him against the fence, killing him instantly.

I am well. Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before all of the places are filled.

I was restless at first because you get to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m. But I am getting used to it, so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot, and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing.

Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there’s warm water. Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food, plus yours, holds you until noon when you get fed again. It’s no wonder these city boys can’t walk much.

We go on “route marches,” which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it’s not my place to tell him different. A “route march” is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.

The sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don’t bother you none.

This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don’t know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don’t move, and it ain’t shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don’t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.

Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain’t like fighting with that ole bull at home. I’m about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake . I only beat him once. He joined up the same time as me, but I’m only 5’6″ and 130 pounds and he’s 6’8″ and near 300 pounds dry.

Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”  

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.  

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.  

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”  

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”  

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”  

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”  

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  
The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.  

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.  

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end.  

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

The cowboy looks at him and says, ""Well, your horse is standing out there in the sun and he don't look too good.""

The Lone Ranger and Tonto run outside and they see that Silver is in bad shape, suffering from heat exhaustion. The Loan Ranger moves his horse into the shade and gets a bucket of water. He then pours some of the water over the horse and gives the rest to Silver to drink. It is then he notices that there isn't a breeze so he asks Tonto if he would start running around Silver to get some air flowing and perhaps cool him down.

Being a faithful friend, Tonto starts running around Silver. The Lone Ranger stands there for a bit then realizes there is not much more he can do, so he goes back into the bar and orders another whiskey.

After a bit a cowboy walks in and says, ""Who's white horse is that outside?""

* Wife: ""Listen, sugar, there ain't nothing in the whole wide world that could wake him up now.""

* Charlie: ""I can't believe that... Certainly if i get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up, won't he?""

Charlie did just that, and was amazed when the husband remained asleep, so he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and called him over again. He pulled another hair to determine if his friend was asleep. This went on **eight times** during the night, and each time before Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs.

Since the man hasn't seen someone else for a while he decides to say something to the farmer.

""nice weather, isn't it?""

A few seconds go by and the farmer seems to have heard what the man said but apparently decides to give no answer.                                                                                                                                                      Just as the man decides to walk along, the farmer says something.

""Do you see that house over there?""

The man, startled by the sudden uttering of words, waits a few seconds before answering the question.

""Yes, yes I do""

“You know who build that house?”

“No I don’t”

“I did. I built it with my own 2 hands. But do you think they call me Collin the housebuilder? No, they do not call me Collin the housebuilder.”

A few seconds of silence follow before the farmer starts talking again.

“ Do you see that church over there?”

“Yes I do.”

“You know who built that church?”

“No, I...”

“Well, I did, with my own 2 hands. And do you think they call me Collin the churchbuilder? Nooo, they don’t call me Collin the churchbuilder!”

The man, feeling more and more uncomfortable and worried by the farmers talking, still stands still as if nailed to the ground but after a slightly longer period of silence, the farmer starts talking again.

“Do you see that fence over there?”

Before the man had the chance to even answer the question, the farmer poses another.

“Do you know who built that fence? Well, that’s right, I did. With my own 2 hands! But do you think they call me Collin the fencebuilder? Noooo, they don’t call me Collin the fencebuilder!”

The man unable to move and startled by the sudden anger of the farmer, stands there looking at the farmer and trying to make sense of this encounter when after a long silence the farmer finally says.

“And I fucked that sheep only once!”

post,51x58z,2qh72,jokes,false,1473424415,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/51x58z/the_sorcerers_apprentice/,self.jokes,,"There once was a sorcerer’s apprentice, who had studied and toiled for many years in the service of his master, and was nearing the time when he should join the Brotherhood as a full member. So for his final project, his master set him this task: that he should destroy the city of Rome and scatter its inhabitants, by means of vegetation and foliage.
This task sounded quite difficult to the apprentice, and he told his master so; after some thought, the master decided that using the power of a talisman would not be cheating, and he gave the apprentice permission to use one. The master rummaged around in his storage shed for a while, and came up with a piece of deep red crystal about the size of a fist, obviously broken from a larger stone. “This is the last remaining fragment of the ancient Sumerian Amulet of Distress, which was used centuries ago by the magicians of Persia to defeat their enemies. It should be more than adequate to your task.”

The apprentice thanked his master and retired to his rooms to begin preparations for the project. He packed many magical ingredients and sorcerous components: newt’s eyes, dog’s tongues, elf teeth, the hair of homniculi, powdered unicorn horn, dragon scales,  everything he thought he might need. He also packed his grimoires and books, his manuals and advisories, instruments and implements, parchment, ink, quills, chalk, candles, vials, a cauldron. He put on a bracelet that would allow him to contact his master telepathically should the need arise. He wrote out his plans in detail, using secret writing and codes to hide the meaning from prying eyes. He loaded it all onto his donkey and began the long journey to Rome.
But he forgot the talisman his master had given him. He forgot the last remaining fragment of the Sumerian Amulet of Distress. Unheeding of the danger, he set up camp near the Seven Hills and prepared his worksite. He started a fire, set up the cauldron and began filling it with ingredients. He chanted and sang. He gestured and danced. He used the entire force of his will and being toward the sole purpose of making the foliage and vegetation grow.

And grow it did. Trees grew taller and bushier, and more menacing. Bushes spread and blocked the roads and highways. Weeds started to invade the aquaducts. Plants everywhere around Rome were growing out of control.
Now, however, the apprentice reached the limit of his power. He had exhausted his own strength and had no more energy to exert. He collapsed in a heap by his campfire. He had overextended himself, used up his own life force in trying to keep the plants growing. He was dying now, and he touched the bracelet, reaching out to his master telepathically.
“Master, what happened? I had everything ready, but the task was still too great. I have failed you and failed myself.”
“My son, are you sure you had everything ready? Everything?”
“Oh no … I forgot it and left it home … the Sumerian Distress Shard!”

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before!
 All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, ""Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.""

Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he promised to pay her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child.

If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he also promised to provide child support until the child turned 18.

She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born.

To keep it discreet, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back.

He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. 'Honey!' she said, 'you received a very strange post card today.'

'Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,' he said.

The wife obeyed and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted.

You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Phil must have experienced.

""Phil was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain.""

Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Phil.

""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

All the men sighed with unified relief. The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""
""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""
The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""
Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""
The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""
Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.
Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""
Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.
The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.
""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""
The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.
Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.
The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.
""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.
""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""

The mortician asked, “How can you tell?”

Gomer said, “Well, Stanley had two ass-holes.”

All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher who was always yelling at him ""you are driving me crazy, Peter""...

One day his mother went to check out how he is doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is simply a disaster, getting very low marks and never had she seen such a dumb boy in her whole career...

The mother could not accept such a feed back and she took her son out from that school. she even shifted to another city ...

25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform..

Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful ...

when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling at her, being under anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk, in turn, he was staring at her face which started turning blue. 

She was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but in vain and eventually died...

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw Peter working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner......      

If you were thinking  that Peter became a doctor, it's because you have been watching too many Indian movies, serials or have read too many motivational fowarded messages...

Peter is Peter . ",Once upon a time,11
