I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"". And I just sat there...

The current rooster was still doing alright, but he was getting old and the farmer decided it couldn't hurt to have a new one.  He buys a suitable young'un from the rooster emporium and turns him loose in the barnyard.  The old rooster sees it strutting around and gets a little worried.

""So they're tryna replace me, eh?"" the old rooster thinks.  ""I'll show them!""

It walks up to the new bird and says ""so you think you're the new stud in town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you?  Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird, and to prove it, I challenge you to race around that hen house over there.  We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.""

Confident in his ability to outpace the old cock, the young roosters remarks, ""Hah!  You're on, and since I'm so great you can even have a half a lap headstart and I'll still win easy!""

So the two roosters head over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch.  The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap, he's still maintaining his lead.  However, with each lap the old rooster lets it slip a little as the new guy catches up.  It's the seventh lap and each rooster is frantically sprinting, with the old rooster just barely leading.

By now, the farmer has heard all the commotion.  He grabs his gun and runs into the barnyard, figuring a fox or something is after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house with the old one still lightly in the lead as they near the last lap.  The farmer takes aim with his shotgun and blows the young rooster to smithereens.

A German soldier called out, ""Hey, Luigi!"".

An Italian soldier stuck his head out and replied, ""Ya?""

BANG!

This went on for a while.

""Hey, Luigi!""

""Ya?""

BANG!

It wasn't too long until the Italians figured out what was going on. One of their officers came up with an idea. He said that a lot of Germans were named Hans, and all they had to do was call out ""Hey, Hans!"" and they'd be shooting Germans, too. It seemed like a good plan so first thing next morning they tried it out.

""Hey, Hans!""

""That you, Luigi?""

""Ya!""

*Bellringer needed for the dawn bell. Large bell, strength needed. Apply in person at the church*

Sure enough, the next day there is a knock on the door. Father Angus answers, eager to meet the applicant. 

Standing in the doorway is a young man, smile on his face, ready to work, however there is an obvious issue - he has **no arms.**

""Mornin, Father. Here about the bellringer job, I am!"" He spoke enthusiastically. 

""Of course my son, of course.... but I must ask - how will ye accomplish the task of ringing the bell? I cannae help but notice, ye have no arms, lad.""

""Ah! Not a problem! Show me the bell and I'll show you my secret!"" Proclaimed the armless man.

Father Angus and the armless man ascended the tower, whereupon the armless man proceeded to approach the large bell and stick his head up inside it.

The armless man said ""stand back,  Father, and watch this!""

Father Angus obediently stood clear as the armless man started ringing the bell by smacking his face against the inside of it.

Bong.
BONG
**BONG**

The armless man then stood clear with a triumphant smile.

Father Angus said ""My boy! That was incredible! Sure ye can have the job - be here at sunrise tomorrow to ring the bell, by God! You will be doing this town a great service!""

The next day, just before dawn,  the armless man ascended the tower, keen to impress on his first day on the job.

He waits until sunrise, approaches the bell and just as before, sticks his head up inside and begins smacking his face on the inside, throwing his body forward with every ring.

Dangerously so, the armless man begins to lose balance...

Bong

BONG

**Ahhhhhhh!!!**

he misses on the third strike, and falls off the edge of the tower, and

**THUD**

Hits the ground dead! Right beside Paddy and Micky, who were walking past at the time.

*""Jeeeeezus* , Micky!"" Says Paddy, pointing at the armless man's body.
""The poor man! Tell me Micky, do you know who this poor man is?""

Micky looks down to examine the body.

""Not too sure Paddy, but his face rings a bell.""

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 

""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal - it didn't hurt his chances that he was the first man she had seen besides her father in years. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest. The old man was standing over him ""First Chinese torture test: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, waddled over to the window and heaved the boulder out. As he did so the old man smiled softly, ""Second Chinese torture test: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward the old man leaned out the window with a large grin, ""Third Chinese torture test: Right testicle tied to bedpost."" ",Chinese Torture,1171

They knew that the authorities would be hot on their tail in only a matter of minutes, so they decided to find somewhere to hide on a nearby farm.

The first prisoner climbed an apple tree, then kept as still as he could within the dense leaves. The second crawled beneath the front steps of the farmhouse, then froze in place. The third prisoner covered himself with several burlap sacks, and they all waited for the inevitable search to be over.

Within minutes, two policemen arrived at the farm. They went first to the burlap sacks and nudged at them.

""Do you think anybody is in there?"" one of the officers asked the other.

Finally she gets directed by a friend to a doctor who says have a method to kill any roundworm. She goes there and the doctor makes all the exams. With all the exames at hand, they start talking:


Doctor: Yes, I know that kind, its a tough son of a b*tch, I dealt with it before and I can kill it. No pill or medication will solve this, I'm affraid the process is somewhat painful.


Woman: I understand, but I want to go thru with it as I'm already feeling pain and my belly is getting bigger
Doctor: All right then, come tomorrow and bring a banana and a breadroll


Woman: A banana and a breadroll???

Doctor: Yes, I understand how this could sound unconventional, but it works. If you trust me, I am quite sure we can get rid of the worm.


Next day the woman arrives at the clinic with both items and enter the doctor's private room:

Doctor: Okay, now I need you to be upside down.

Woman: What??

Doctor: Trust me, we'll get that rascal, we'll show it.

Woman: Okay then.


So the doctor starts to insert slowly the breadroll inside the woman's anus and she starts to scream in pain. After the breadroll, the doctor inserts the banana.


After its all done the doctor tells the woman: 


Doctor: Come tomorrow again and bring another breadroll and another banana.

Woman: What? Once again?

Doctor: Do not question, I know what I'm doing.


After 1 week of sticking breadrolls and bananas inside the woman's anus, she finally gets fed up and blatantly challenges the doctor: 


Woman: Okay, what are doing now? I am fed up with this, I've been feeling too much pain with this treatment and didnt see any result. When will this end?
Doctor: Do not worry, it will end tomorrow. You will come here tomorrow, but bring only the breadroll. Do not bring the banana.


The next day the woman arrives with the breadroll, enters the room and notice that for the first time, the doctor has assistant, who he calls ""John"", and is holding a hammer. So, they continue to their usual treatment routine, the woman gets upside down and:


Doctor: All right, I'm coming with the breadroll, okay?

Woman: Wow doctor, that really hurts a lot.


After 2 excruciating minutes:


Doctor: Okay, now that the breadroll is in, we wait.

Woman: Wait for what?

Doctor: Dont you worry, just stay upside down like you are and dont move.

Woman: All right.

Doctor: John, come nearer, it can happen any moment now.


10 minutes after the breadroll, the woman is upside down and they finally see the worm. Its getting out, and it sees the doctor and screams: 


Worm: Hey, where's my banana????

Doctor: Now John, now!!!!


BAM!!

The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 9000 wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 9000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not the hardest metal known to man.

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the clerk, who happens to be the store owner, and though at first the clerk says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black ebony box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter--all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. ""Let me demonstrate,"" he says. He looks at the box and says ""Voodoo Dick--The Door!"" and the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says ""Voodoo Dick--The Box!"" and the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it to him. 


When he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says ""Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?"" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says ""Voodoo dick, my pussy,"" thinking the whole thing rather rediculous. After about 15 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off. So she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts multiple orgasming, and so she swerves a bit over the yellow line. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, ""Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?"" She says quickly ""Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! there's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!"" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says ""Voodoo Dick my ass, lady.""",Voodoo Dick,2

After six months or so of almost total isolation, someone knocks on his door.  He opens it, and a huge, bearded man is standing there.

""Great"", says Tom, ""after six months out here I'm ready to meet some local folks.  Thank you.""

As Lars is leaving, he stops.  ""Gotta warn you ... be some drinkin.""

""Not a problem"" says Tom.  ""After 25 years in the business, I can drink with the best of 'em.""

 Again, the big man starts to leave and stops.  ""More 'n' likely gonna be some fightin' too.""

""Well, I get along with people, I'll be all right.  I'll be there, thanks again.""

""More'n likely be some wild sex, too.""

Three bad Catholics die and go to heaven.  Saint Peter says to them ""To get into heaven, you must pass a quiz first.  What is Easter?""

The first Catholic steps up and says, ""Easter is the holiday when a big fat man comes down your chimney and hands out presents.""

Saint Peter says, ""No.  That's not right.  That's Christmas.""

The second Catholic says, ""Of course, that's Christmas.  Everyone knows Easter is the day when children put on masks and go door to door saying 'trick or treat' and getting candy.""

Saint Peter says, ""No.  You're thinking of Halloween.  How have you all not heard of Easter?  Do you know what Easter is?"" he says, motioning to the third.

The final Catholic says, ""I apologize for my friends.  I know what Easter is.  Easter is when our lord and savior Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate for the forgiveness of our sins.  He suffered, died, and was buried.  They put his body in a tomb and rolled a big stone in front of it.  On the third day,  the disciples rolled the rock away, and they saw Jesus Christ had risen from the dead in fulfillment of the scriptures...""

""That's an excellent answer!"" St. Peter exclaimed.

""...and as he rose from the dead, Christ saw his shadow and we got six more weeks of winter.""",What is Easter?,137

She leaned in and gave him a kiss. He then decided to press his luck. ""I've also never been fucked. Will you fuck me?""

The woman nodded. His face lit up with joy. Then, she picked him up off the blanket, carried him into the water, and threw him in.

and cook a venison steak. But, all of Bubba's neighbors were Catholic....
and since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on Friday.

The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a
problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The
Priest came to visit Bubba, and suggested that he become Catholic. After
several classes and much study, Bubba attended Mass.....and as the
Priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said,

""You were born a Baptist, and raised a Baptist, but now you are a Catholic.""

Bubba's neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived and the
wonderful aroma of grilled venison filled the neighborhood. The Priest was called
immediately by the neighbors, and as he rushed into Bubba's yard, clutching a
rosary and prepared to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement.
There stood Bubba, clutching a small bottle of holy water which he carefully
sprinkled over the grilling meat as he chanted:

""You wuz born a deer, you wuz raised a deer, but now you is a catfish.""",Lent joke to tell tomorrow for Easter,236

The helicopter flies off.

Well, as you might expect, the man's house was washed away and the man drowned. He arrives in heaven. The Lord greets him at the gates.

All the typical answers came up -- teacher, nurse, businesswoman, saleswoman, doctor, lawyer, and so forth.

However, little Johnny was being uncharacteristically quiet, So when the teacher gently prodded him about his mother, He replied, ""Well my mother's an exotic dancer in a club and takes off all her clothes in front of men, and they put money in her underwear. Sometimes, if the offer is really good, she will go home with some guy and stay with him all night for money.""

The teacher, obviously shaken by this bold statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and then took little Johnny aside to quietly ask him, ""Is that really true about your mother, dear?""

Nope,"" the boy said, ""She works for the Democratic National Committee and is helping to get Hillary Clinton to be our next President, but I was too embarrassed to say that In front of the other kids.""","My Mommy, the Dancer",33

A visiting professor at Harvard University is giving a seminar on the supernatural. To get a feel for his audience, he asks: ""How many people here believe in ghosts?"" About 90 students raise their hands.

""Well that’s a good start. Out of those of you who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you’ve ever seen a ghost?"" About 40 students raise their hands.

""That’s really good. I’m really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost? 15 students raise their hands. ""That’s a great response. Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?"" 

Three students raise their hands. ""That’s fantastic. But let me ask you one question further.....Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?"" One Arab student in the back raises his hand. The professor is astonished. He takes off his glasses, takes a step back, and says, ""Son, all the years I’ve been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have slept with a ghost. You’ve got to come up here and tell us about your experience."" The student replies with a nod and a grin, and begins to make his way up to the podium. The professor says, ""Well, tell us what it’s like to have sex with a ghost."" The student replies, ""Ghost? Damn..... From back there I thought you said ’goats’!""

It's after midnight.   While en-route home, he asks the cabby if he would be a witness.  The man suspects his wife is having an affair, and he wants to catch her in the act.  For $100, the cabby agrees.
 
Quietly arriving home, the husband and cabby tip toe into the bedroom.  The husband switches on the lights, yanks the blanket back and there is his wife, naked, with a man!
 
The husband puts a gun to the naked man's head.
 
The wife shouts, 'Don't do it! I lied when I told you I inherited money'.
HE paid for the Porsche I gave you. 
HE paid for your new 25 ft. Ranger Fishing Boat . 
HE paid for your Packer season tickets.
HE paid for our house at the lake.
HE paid for your Golf Trip to St Andrews and your new 4 x 4.
 
HE paid for our country club membership.
and HE even pays the monthly dues!'
 
Shaking his head from side-to-side, the husband lowers the gun.
 
He looks over at the cabby and says, 'What would you do'?

""Nah, I don't wanna go, they'll make fun of me for my wooden eye,"" the man responds. 
""Nonsense,"" says his friend ""Come on, it'll be dark, everyone will be drunk, no one will notice your eye.""
So the man agrees to go to the dance. 
After sitting and drinking a couple more beers at the mans friend comes over and says, ""Hey, see that big girl over there sitting by herself, no one has asked her to dance all night. Why don't you go ask her?"" 
The man, having had a few drinks decides, what the hell. So he musters up his courage and approaches the larger lady, ""Would you like to dance?""
""Would I, would I?!"" Responds the lady. 
""Fat ass, fat ass!"" Yells the man.

However, as he is leaving a car pulls up and two of his synagogue members are in the car, with a baby in the back seat.

""Rabbi"" they call, ""Can you help us?""

""Of course!"" says the Rabbi, ""How can I be of assistance?""

""We have our baby boy in the back and we want to have him circumcised, but we don't have any money to spend on the ceremony. Would you be so kind as to do it now? If you do we'll give you a lift home.""

The Rabbi ponders this, but eventually agrees. He climbs in the back of the car and they set off to his house.

The Rabbi pulls the baby's diaper off and has to do a double take, for this baby has the smallest penis he has ever had to circumcise. But he does the deed and the baby's foreskin comes off.

They eventually reach the Rabbi's house around 15 minutes before he would normally arrive. The couple thank the Rabbi and drive off. He goes inside and is greeted by his surprised wife.

""Oh, hello dear!"" she exclaims, ""You're early today.""

post,4bt78z,2qh72,jokes,false,1458848813,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4bt78z/the_train_conductor/,self.jokes,,"So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal - three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

As he's riding to work, he's sees a hearse in front of him and thinks ""I wonder who died?"" He tries to ride past the hearse and hears a sound from inside the hearse that goes like ""Whomp. Whomp. Whomp.""

He steps off his hoverboard. ""Whomp."" it goes again. He knocks on the window, which are really tinted. The ""Whomp"" gets louder and notices its coming from the back of the hearse. He goes to the back of the hearse and thinks that someone might be in there!

He hears a huge ""Whomp"" and the back explodes and a coffin slides out the back of the hearse. He goes up to the coffin and thinks ""Someone might be in there!"" The coffin suddenly stands up vertically and turns towards him. It then jumps a little towards with a ""Whomp"".

A police officer walks towards him and says ""Is this your hearse?""
The guy says ""No. I came here on a hoverboard. I was just riding to work on it."" The officer says ""Oh, that thing on the curb?"" and asks to try it. The guy says ""Sure."" and then the Coffin just slams down and crushed the officer.

The guy then thinks ""Woah I should get out of here!"" He runs over to his hoverboard and speeds off, but the coffin is jumping towards him again. And the coffin is going ""Whomp"" again. And the guys like ""Oh I should have got a car"" ""Whomp"" it goes again.

He sees a verizion wireless store ahead and decides to call the police, because there might be phones thread and he doesn't have one. So he goes into the store and says ""Oh I need to use a phone because its an emergency"" the guy behind the counter says ""Hey, is that a hoverboard? Is it any good?"" the guy says ""yeah sure"" and the counter guy asks to try it.

 They both go outside, with counter guy on the hoverboard and starts riding towards the door, but the coffin just fucking ""Whomp""''s through the door and decapitates him. The guy is like ""shit this day is shit"" The hoverboard rolled out from underneath by the way.

The coffin then turns to him and the guy speeds off on the hoverboard with the coffin jumping behind him. The guy decides to go home because there's a cord phone there. He sees his house and goes to his front door, which has one of those keypad locks and he puts in the code, but its wrong because he changed it. he puts in the new one and enters.

He shuts the door and locks it and the ""Whomp"" stops. He hears a knock like half an hour later. He opens the door and the coffin is there and it slides into his house. The guy is like ""oh fuck"" and he begins to run away from the coffin. The coffin then just starts destroying shit while running after him.

Its coming after him and the guy runs into the hallway and the coffin is still destroying shit while chasing after him. Then the guy locks himself in the bathroom and the coffin breaks down the door and the guy opens his medicine door.

And he throws some cough medicine at the coffin and it just stops.",The Coffin Joke,0
