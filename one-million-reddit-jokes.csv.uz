All 4 men did as such and stood arm-to-arm. The man came back into the room, and following him was one of the most beautiful woman any of them had seen. The woman began walking in front of each of them and as she walked in front of the first man, his bell started going off. He hung his head in shame. The woman walked in front of the second ~~wo~~man and the same happened to him. Next, she walked in front of the third man and his bell rang so hard that his bell fell off. She walked by the fourth, and his bell remained silent. She exited the room and the fourth was congratulated for passing all of the trials. ""Pick up your bell number three"" he said. As the third bent over and picked up his bell, the fourth's bell began ringing so hard, it fell off as well.

On shore there was a bear watching this and thought if that fly moves down 6 inches and the fish jumps out of the water I could grab that fish for a nice meal today.

A few yards behind the beat there was a hunter having lunch watching all this who thought if that fly moves down 6 inches and the fish jumps out of the and the bear reaches to grab that fish I could shoot the bear for a nice trophy today.

Well, just about that time it got too hot for the fly soooo the fly moved down 6 inches and the fish jumped out of the and the bear reached to grab that fish and the hunter went to shoot the bear and the mouse went for the sandwich and the cat pounced for the mouse.

The bartender says: ""It's in the back, on the right but I must warn you, we have a resident genie living in there. Whatever you do, don't make a wish.""

Musing to himself as soberly as possible, the man chalks up the strange comment to some in-house humour and makes his way to the washroom. 

As he's bleeding his lizard he hears a loud POOF and sure enough a genie materialises behind him. 

The genie says: ""You have awoken me from my urinal slumber, you may request one wish""

Feeling good from the drink and being down on his luck the man wishes for a million bucks. 

The genie replies: ""And so a million ducks you shall have.""

Ducks start appearing from thin air, filling the bathroom to the rafters, spilling into the bar and make a veritable duck tsunami that goes crashing into the streets. 

After composing himself and fighting free of the ducks he makes his way back to the bartender and apologies for the mess he's made.

Do you know that the words ""race car"" spelled backwards still spells ""race car""?
  
And that ""eat"" is the only word that if you take the first letter and move it to the last, it spells its past tense ""ate?

So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. 

This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is
not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... 

....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a Divine Being which explains why, last night, Anabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.'",Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?,1

One night as they were driving to yet another rubber-chicken dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur (a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks &amp; manner) that he was tired of speech making.
“I have and idea, boss,” his chauffeur said. “I’ve heard you give this speech so many times. I’ll bet I could give it for you.”

Einstein laughed loudly and said, “Why not? Let’s do it!”

When they arrive at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur’s cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein’s speech and even answered a few questions expertly.

Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody’s fool.

Without missing a beat, the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said, “Sir, the answer to that question is so simple that I will let my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, answer it for me.”",Einstein's chauffeur.,11

He's struggling outside the store to carry all his load, but eventually after some ordering and clumsy balancing he manages to get moving. 
After a minute, he encounters the amazing looking girl of the neighboring farm where he always had an eye on, but never really spoken to.

She sees him doing real balancing-tricks with his supplies, and amused she starts talking.

They start walking to their homes, chitchatting about everything. Jimmy is surprised that she really seems to like him.

Halfway on the road they arrive at an intersection. The girl wants to take the left, but Jimmy insists: ""No, let's take my short cut and go down this alley. It's the shortest for both our farms, we'll be there in no time!""

But the girl looks him over cautiously then said, ""Oh Jimmy, how could you! I am a lonely girl with no one around to defend me. How could I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?"" 

Jimmy replies: ""Oh my god, miss! Remember I'm carrying a bucket, a big can of red paint, a dozen of eggs, two chickens and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?""

The girl immediately replies  ""Put those eggs aside, turn the bucket upside down, put the goose inside it, put the big can of paint on top of the bucket so it won't get away, and I'll hold the chickens!""

Now, I had spent time around her parents once or twice before, but this would be the first time that I'd ever encountered any of her siblings, and this was apparently a big deal in her family.

It was mid-afternoon when I pulled up to the house, and I spotted my fiancé coming out the front door.

""Oh, I'm so glad you're here!"" she told me. ""I need to run to the store for some dinner supplies, though. Go make yourself comfortable, and I'll be back in about an hour.""

Well, I went inside and walked to the living room... and there, sitting on the couch, was my fiancé's absolutely gorgeous eighteen-year-old sister. Her pert, youthful breasts were clearly visible through the material of her tank top... and below the waist, she was wearing nothing but a pair of pink panties.

""I knew you'd be coming,"" she said, ""and I know this is probably a bad idea... but I've heard so much about you from my sister, including how amazing you are in bed. I've been saving my virginity for the right man, and since you're not married yet, I want it to be you. I'll be upstairs in my bedroom, completely naked. It's the first door on the left.""

With that, she stood up and slowly walked away. I watched the way that her hips swayed, the subtle bounce of each buttock as she moved... and I confess, I stood there thinking for a brief moment. Then, after taking a deep breath, I quickly left the house.

As soon as I walked outside, I was greeted by a huge explosion of applause. Dozens of men and women were surrounding the door, each of them with smiles on their faces. My fiancé came rushing up to me from within the crowd and threw her arms around me.

""I knew you'd be loyal!"" she laughed. ""I'm sorry to put you through that, but I knew you'd stay true to me... and now my entire family knows, too!""

Aunts, uncles, cousins, and other relatives all came up to me, offering their congratulations and welcoming me to the family. If I'm honest, I felt a little bit hurt by the whole affair, and thoroughly out of my element. Still, I learned something that day, too, and it's a moral that I've carried with me ever since:

Always keep your condoms in your car.",I went to meet my fiancé's family...,88

As he's unzipping a dwarf walks up to the adjacent urinal and does the same. The man hears a mighty stream coming from the dwarf and slyly takes a peak to see what the little man is packing.   
 
To his surprise the dwarf's penis was gigantic, at least 12"" long with a substantial girth. The man is flabbergasted, but he finishes his pee in silence, zips up, and goes to wash his hands. The dwarf finishes around the same time and goes to wash his hands as well.   
   
After a few seconds the man can't stop himself and breaks the silence.      
   
 ""Sir, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help noticing you've got such a large penis. How could a man with your small stature have such a big dick!?""  
  
 The dwarf smiles, ""You noticed that, eh? Well it's simple lad, I'm a leprechaun, I just wished it upon myself. I could do the same for you, if you'd like, but it'll cost you.""  
  
The man thinks shortly about how much his life could change if he had a bigger penis, and liking the image he painted in his head he asks ""well how much?""  
     
""Oh, I don't want money. If you want a dick like this you'll have to get on all fours and let me have my way with you.""  
  
The man is taken aback, but he starts to weigh the options in his head. 'I really don't want to get violated by a leprechaun, but I DO want a bigger dick...' He agrees to the terms and assumes the position.    
 
The leprechaun mounts him from behind and starts pumping steadily. ""By the way lad, how old are ya?""    
 
""32, why?""   
  
""32 years old and you still believe in leprechauns!?""",A wish for a larger phallus,8

One day he got off in a small town and on his way to the nearest bar he spotted a small dog in an alleyway.  He thought, ""Ah, perfect!"", scooped the dog up and proceeded to the bar.  Once inside he sat on a stool and put the dog down on the stool next to him.  When the bartender turned to him the drunk ordered a beer and before the bartender could protest the presence of the dog he threw his voice and made the dog say, ""I'll have one too!""  Perplexed, the bartender poured two beers and set them in front of the drunk and the dog.  The drunk drank his beer and when the bartender turned away, he quickly downed the dog's beer too.  When the bartender came back to them the drunk ordered another beer and threw his voice again, so the dog ordered one as well.  This time, the bartender unable to contain his curiosity and bewilderment, rubbed his head and asked, ""Am I out of it, or is that dog talking?""  The drunk ventriloquist smiled and said, ""Yeah, he's been talkin' ever since he was a pup!""  The bartender's eyes widened and he calmly asked the drunk, ""Would you ever consider selling that dog?""  The drunk frowned and looked at the dog.  After a couple of seconds he replied, ""Well, he means a lot to me and normally I would never consider it, but as you can see, I'm down on my luck and it may be the best for the dog, but I have to say that I couldn't take less than a thousand dollars.""  The bartender looked in the register and answered, ""All I have is $500 now, could I owe you the rest?""  The drunk frowned again, but replied, ""I guess I don't have much of a choice.  Ok, it's a deal!""  The drunk finished his beer and left the bar $500 richer.

A month or so later, the drunk happens upon the same town and wanders into the same bar in a drunken stupor.  He had forgotten all about the previous encounter, but the same bartender was there and recognized him instantly!  The bartender walked swiftly over to the drunk and in an angry voice said, ""You son of a bitch!  You sold me that dog and he hasn't said a word since!!""  The drunk ventriloquist all of the sudden remembered the situation and was quick to reply, ""Really?!  That's strange.  Where is he?  Do you still have him?""  The bartender sighed deeply and said, ""Yeah, I've got him tied up out back...""  The drunk insisted on seeing the dog.  Once out back, the drunk leaned down and rubbed the dog on the head and scratched behind his ears and said, ""Hey!  I told you that you had to talk for this guy just like you talked for me.  What's wrong?!?""  He threw his voice again and the dog replied, ""I ain't sayin' nothin' till he gives you that other $500!!""",The Drunk Ventriloquist,12

God also said that she would bear his offspring and and not bother him in the middle of the night if the kids woke up and started crying.

She would never nag him and would admit when she was wrong. She would also freely give him love and passion whenever he needed it.

Recently, I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man at 11am.

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery on the far outskirts of town..

As I was not familiar with the remote areas, I got lost.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently left and the hearse was nowhere in sight.

There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.

I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place.

I didn’t know what else to do. I felt terrible having missed this poor man's service. So I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around.

I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends.

I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep.

They wept, I wept, we all wept together. It was somber, and yet, we were together as one.

When I finished, I packed up my guitar and started for my car.

Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say,

“I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery on the far outskirts of town..

As I was not familiar with the remote areas, I got lost.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently left and the hearse was nowhere in sight.

There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.

I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place.

I didn’t know what else to do. I felt terrible having missed this poor man's service. So I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around.

I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends.

I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep.

They wept, I wept, we all wept together. It was somber, and yet, we were together as one.

When I finished, I packed up my guitar and started for my car.

Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say,

“I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Apparently, I was still lost…","As a guitarist, I sometimes get asked to play for people.",585

Pillows are never where you think they are, well you finally find them. You look at all your choices, firm, soft, extra firm, extra soft, memory foam, goose down, polyester blends, small ones, long ones, thick ones, thin ones. You grab one feel it with your hands to see if it meets your standards (like small talk exchanging numbers and what not) place it in your buggy. Push it to the front of the store, while thinking, ""is this one right for me? Is it better than the one I had before?"" Well you buy it. Put it in your car (which is like ""talking"") you stop by your parents house, say something to your mom about your new pillow. She jumps up says ""you shouldn't have bought one, I have tons"" walks back with your pillow from high school  (This is running into old flames) and a few others you've never seen before (these are the ton of new people that pop up when you have spotted your new crush). Now you have three pillows. Take your pillows to your room now you don't know which is really going to make you happy. You try your old one from high school and it smells way too bad to keep in the room and you remember why you left it. Now for the other mom pushed on ya, but you didn't pick it out you have no connection with it, just doesn't feel right. The one you picked out is left. You lay down, it feels weird. So you push on it, fold it each night still wondering if it's right for you. Soon you have shaped it to how you like it. Never thinking a thing about it after a while. Then one day you stay out of town, something is missing. It hits you all you want is your pillow, it makes everything right. Now you know you picked the right person.

The bartender rolls his eyes and says, ""Fine. That cue ball over there.""

Much to his surprise, the monkey hops off the man's shoulder, scampers over to the pool table, grabs the cue ball and pops it in his mouth, swallowing it whole. 

The bartender is, of course, absolutely stunned. The man smirks at him and says, ""See? Now, I have a bet for you. I'll bet you $200 that you can't find something my monkey won't eat. In other words, I'm gonna come back here next Friday and if you find something he won't eat, I'll give you $200. But if he eats it, you give *me* $200. Sound fair?""

The bartender, still stunned, nods. He spends the rest of the week researching what breed of monkey it is and finds out that this particular type of monkey is famous for avoiding kiwi fruit. They won't even come near the things. 

So Friday comes around and the bartender is ready - he's got his kiwi on the bar and everything. 

The man and his monkey come in and walk up to the bar. The bartender says, ""All right, I bet you that your monkey will not eat this kiwi.""

The man says, ""You're on. Monkey, eat that kiwi!""

The monkey scampers down his arm and onto the bar. He picks up the kiwi, looks at it, shoves it up his ass, takes it out and eats it. 

The bartender exclaims, ""What the fuck was *that???*""

And the man coolly replies, ""Well after he passed the cue ball, he decided he better start sizing everything first.""",Guy walks into a bar with a monkey on his shoulder...,5

The first one came back and said to the king, “I brought ten apples.” The king then explained, “Next, you have to shove the fruits up your butt without so much as an expression on your face, or you’ll be eaten.” The first apple went in, but on the second he winced in pain, and was killed.  
  
The second one arrived, and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy.

this broad and they went back to his place.
Before they got undressed to do the horizontal
mambo, he said, ""Listen, I'm sorry but I don't
think we should have sex right away"". ""Why's
that?"" she said.
""Well you see, I'm hung like a baby, and I
wouldn't want you to laugh and decide you didn't
want to have sex with me. Why don't we get to
know each other first, and then when we feel
we're ready, we'll do it.""
So the girl agreed, but only because he was a
good-looking dude and pretty nice.
Several dates later, they make it back to his
place again, and after some conversation, they
decide it's time. She undresses and slides into
bed. He undresses, pulls out his dick, and slams
it onto the bed with a thunderous noise.
She stares at his gigantic dick, in complete
shock and awe.
""B-b-but I thought you said you were hung like a
baby?""
""I am,"" he replied. ""8 lbs, 14 and 1/2 inches.""

Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.
While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.
Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.
Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""
Harry: ""9.""
Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""
Harry: ""36.""

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""
Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""
Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""
Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""
Harry: ""Pants.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.
She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'
To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'
'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.
'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.

A man walks into a Bar with a Parrot on his shoulder.

They throw their pots and pans in their air and record the sounds:
Ping Bang Pow.

How do you blindfold an Asian?

White people are born purple.
Then turn pink.
When they're mad, they're red.
When they're sick they're green.
When they're scared they're yellow.
When they're cold they're blue.

One day, a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven, where he meets the Lord Himself. 

The Lord says to the cat, ""You lived a good life, and if there is any way I can make your stay in heaven more comfortable, please let me know."" 

The cat thinks for a moment and says, ""Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."" 

The Lord stops the cat and says, ""Say no more,"" and a wonderful, fluffy pillow appears. 

A few days later, six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident, and all of them go to heaven. Again, the Lord is there to greet them with the same offer. 

The mice answer, ""All our lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of running. Do you think we could have roller skates so that we don't have to run anymore?"" 

The Lord says, ""Say no more"" and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates. 

About a week later, the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him snoozing on the pillow. 

The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him, ""How are things since you got here?"" 

The cat stretches and yawns, then replies, ""It is wonderful here. Better than I could have ever expected. And those 'Meals On Wheels' you've been sending by are the best!""

The doctor explains that conventional medicine can do nothing for him. However, he adds, there is an experimental treatment. The man quickly assures the doctor that he will try anything. The doctor tells him the operation must coincide with the death of a baby elephant. The doctor explains that the musculature of an infant elephants trunk is very similar to that of a penis and that research shows a transplant may be possible. So the man returns home to await the call that they have a trunk on ice. 

Several months pass and the man is miserable. He tells the doctor his confidence is gone, he never goes out, he's missing too much work and drinking too much. The doctor consoles him as best he can until finally the day comes. The man awakes after surgery to see the surgeons smiling face. The operation was a success. After months of difficult physical therapy the man has regained his confidence. To celebrate he asks a woman to accompany him to a fine restaurant. They meet in the bar and all is going well over drinks and small talk. They proceed to their table and the waiter comes to take their order. Before he leaves for the kitchen he places a basket of dinner rolls on the table.

A farmer stopped by the local mechanic’s shop to have his truck fixed. They couldn't do it while he waited, so he said he didn't live far away and would just walk home.

On the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the feedstore and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had the problem of how to carry all of his purchases home.

While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, ""Can you tell me how to get to 1603 Mockingbird Lane?""

The farmer said, ""Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house. I would walk you there but I can't carry this lot.""

The old lady suggested, ""Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand; put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?""

""Why thank you very much,"" he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home.

On the way he says ""Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time.""

The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, ""I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?""

The farmer said, ""Holy smokes lady! I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?""

The old lady replied, ""Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens.""",The Farmer and the Widow,17

Some time later the waiter brings the soup, and clumsily while he's eating he drops the spoon.  

""Waiter, I dropped my spoon, could I trouble you for another?""  The waiter, without hesitation, pulls a spoon out of his pocket and hands it to the man.  He thinks nothing of it, and continues to eat his soup.

Thinking to himself, it later occurs to him that it was odd that the waiter should already have a spoon ready to give, so he decides to ask as the same waiter passes by.  

""Excuse me, this is an odd question, but why did you already have a spoon with you?""

The waiter smiles and says, ""Funny thing, the owner hired a consultant to overview the various workings of the restaurant and determined that trips to the kitchen for utensils was a waste of time.  Statistically, spoons were the most likely to fall so we all carry spoons on us for just such an occasion.""

""That is brilliant!"", the man replies.

The waiter continues, ""It doesn't end there.  Between us, the consultant also determined that washing hands after using the bathroom was a waste of time and had us all tie a string around our penises so we can use the bathroom without ever having to touch it.""

The man thinks for a moment and inquires, ""Hmm, but how do you get it back into your pants?""

post,3oncow,2qh72,jokes,false,1444776596,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3oncow/home_remedies_for_mouth_odor/,self.jokes,,"Mouth odor is a common problem that mostly affects people who are not observing regular oral hygiene. The most obvious reason for an odor of the mouth is that particles of the food we consume remain in the gaps between the teeth. This rot over a period of time results in mouth odour or halitosis.

How To Prevent Mouth Odour

The easiest way to ensure that you do not have mouth odor is to clean and floss your teeth regularly. Do not forget to clean your tongue. 


Rinsing your mouth with warm water and salt is another remedy. 


Chewing on cloves will ensure that your mouth smells fresh.


If the smell refuses to go away despite these remedies then you need to see a doctor. Sometimes a bad smell in the mouth is connected to some kind of problem in the stomach. People who are suffering from constipation regularly that smells of their mouth and should consult their doctor at the earliest.

Drop in a handful of fenugreek seeds in a pot of cold water and boil. Then strain and drink the liquid with the essence of fenugreek in.

Do not eat food products containing white flour and sugar. Healthy meals would prefer your food. Instead, eat healthy meals. These should include fresh fruits and raw vegetables. You can drink a variety of juices, but avoid drinking coffee or carbonated beverages.

The Coach looked a little skeptical, but not wanting to discriminate, he agreed.

The Coach is impressed, and makes no delay in adding the armless man to his team.

Coincidentally, the very next man has arms, but is missing his legs.

The Coach is nervous about letting such a physically challenged man into his trial, but reluctantly agreed.

The no-legged man drags himself into the pool and proceeds to spin his arms so fast, he looked a blur, completing the trial even faster than the armless man.

With a huge smile on his face, the Coach adds the legless man to the team, when he hears a voice behind him.

""Oy! Wot bout me mate?""

The Coach spins around, yet sees no-one, looking down, he is surprised to see a man who is just a head, staring back up at him.

""Carn Bruv!"" Exclaimed the head, ""Drop us in the pool, i'll blitz all these uvver wankers!""

After the previous two participants, the Coach is excited to see what what amazing time the head will be able to record. 

He picks up the head, drops him in the pool, and the head promptly sinks to the bottom.

The Coach waits patiently, yet the head doesn't move.

A minute later...

The head hasn't moved, a small stream of bubbles float up to the surface.

After another minute, the Coach has become worried, grabs a pool scoop and retrieves the head to the edge of the pool.

Coughing and spluttering, the head recovers quickly.
