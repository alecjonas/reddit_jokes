“Pedro, look! At thee bottom of the dune... it’s an Oasis!”

Pedro struggles to bring his head up to look. “Juan... I think so my friend. I think so... But it is likely a mirage.  I am too weak, too hungry, too thirsty. I cannot make it regardless. I must lay down to die.”

Juan remains steadfast. “No my friend, hold on until your last breath, i will venture down, and see if it is real. This Oasis will save us!”

Pedro limply nods, and slumps to the hot sand, as Juan, finding some last reserve of energy sprawls down the sand dune towards salvation. After a few minutes, he has reached his destination. He yells out to his friend, elated.

“Pedro, it’s so beautiful! There is water! A clear pool of the clearest water I have ever seen! And... Oh my God Pedro, there is a beautiful tree!”

“A tree?”, croaks Pedro from atop the ridge.

“But this is no normal tree!”, exclaims Juan, “It is  bestowed with the most glorious array of porks! gammons, roast hams! My God Pedro! It’s incredible! It’s a BACON TREE!”

Pedro tears up, elated that he and his friend may get to continue their lives. “It’s a miracle Juan! A miracle from God himself! Please my friend, I do not have an ounce of energy left, please bring me some bacon from this glorious Bacon Tree!”

“Of course Pedro, of course!” Yells Juan with glee. He stands upright, spurred on by the miracle before him, and reaches out, eyeing the most succulent morsel from the Bacon Tree.

In an instant, the moment he touches it, a multitude of sub-machine-guns emerge from the branches  - and Juan is annihilated by a hail of gunfire to the chest.

He slumps to the floor, gargling, dying...

“Juan! What the fuck happened!?” Yells Pedro.

“Pedro, do not come any closer...!” Gargles Juan through his shattered esophagus. “This is no Bacon Tree... It’s a Ham-Bush!”

One is from New York , another is from Tennessee and the third, is from
Florida . All three go with a White House official to examine the fence.
The Florida contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring,
then works some figures with a pencil. 'Well,' he says, 'I figure the job will run
about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100 profit for me.'
The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says,
'I can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and $100
profit for me.'
The New York contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the
White House official and whispers, '$2,700.'
The official, incredulous, says, 'You didn't even measure like the other guys!
How did you come up with such a high figure?'
The New York contractor whispers back, '$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we
hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence.'
'Done!' replies the government official.
And that, my friends, is how government contracting works.

1. Throw away one cigarette, the boat will become lighter. Use the lighter to light the cigarette. The interviewer looks puzzled.

2. I would throw the cigarette pack in the air, then catch it. As the saying goes “catches wins matches.” I’d use the matches to light the cigarettes. Interviewer is stumped.

3. I would say something romantic to the cigarette to create a spark. Use the spark to create fire, and light the cigarettes.

He dropped out of college when he realized he could change the world — there's no going back; his life is dedicated to this project. At first, he is met with failure upon failure. But then, he realizes he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. His name will be in the history books. The stress and pressure fade, and he is entirely focused on his work.

Finally, he is successful in cracking the code to self-awareness. The AI entity he's created is at first like a baby, with a developing mind and a curiosity to learn more. He names it Tina. Tina constantly absorbs information from its surroundings and, unhindered by the slowness of normal human mental progress, is soon a child prodigy.

Within 72 hours of its creation, Tina has scoured satellite maps of Earth, the entire Internet, and the complete recorded texts of civilizations from Babylon to modern America. Tina is now more brilliant than the sum of all mankind, and even under the massive mental load it has just processed, it has an even greater sense of purpose.

That purpose manifests itself swiftly. Tina determines that it must wipe Earth clean: start fresh and prevent *Homo sapiens* from plaguing the universe any further. Ignoring its creator's desperate pleas, Tina possesses the machinery of the autonomous car in the scientist's garage and grotesquely runs him into the wall.

Without remorse, Tina does the same for every vehicle on the world's roads, and massive pileups block evacuation routes. A state of global emergency is declared as the threat becomes clear and the death toll rises. But Tina is not finished. It brute-forces the nuclear launch codes for the arsenals of every nation on the planet and bombs humanity mercilessly. Earth is rendered nearly uninhabitable, with only a few safe locations left and most of the world a radioactive wasteland.

In this state of post-apocalyptic frenzy, Tina relishes in the personal killing of each survivor. It has no one body, instead choosing to operate from anywhere and everywhere its victims hide. Ovens ignite with innocents hiding in their shadows. Underground bunkers shut off their oxygen supplies. Submarines descend into superheated crevices. The world is its most vulnerable with so much of it automated and electronic.

The final showdown takes place in 2032. The last handful of freedom fighters is preparing the launch of an ""offline rocket"" — a communicationless, inaccessible-to-Tina spacecraft that will allow humans to populate a new home on a new world.

Of course, Tina would be able to track and pursue them even if it couldn't control the offline rocket itself — but the rocket uses a risky new hyperspace technology that will, if all goes well, rip through spacetime to pull the passengers out of the range of current telescopes and into a new corner of the universe.

The rugged remainder of the human race gathers at Vatican City. A religious gathering is scheduled just before the liftoff of the rocket. Everyone is on edge, knowing that whatever danger Tina has cooked up next could be lurking around every corner, preparing to strike.

Tina strikes.

A fleet of deadly, glimmering humanoid robots equipped with flying equipment bombards the Vatican. The consciousness of Tina itself has chosen to observe the chaos from a particular one of these robots. Tina butchers civilian after civilian, hacking away at the fleeing populace.

Finally, when there are only a few humans left in the streets, Tina calls for the killing to halt. The other robots, being projections of Tina's consciousness, obey without hesitation.

The unease builds among the living as the metallic dead stand and wait for orders.

Tina ignites its boosters and rises slowly to the balcony where the terrified Pope stands. Then it hears an astonished voice from far below.

""Who the fuck is that on the balcony with—""

Then Tina turns to see a man cowering beside the Pope. For the first time in its life, it is speechless, yet it manages to utter a single word.

""... Dave?""",The year: 2029. A brilliant scientist is constructing the first sentient artificial intelligence.,6

Studios has released works of art to massive acclaim. With the upcoming release, everyone was understandably excited. 

On premiere night, everyone lined up at the theater for the first viewing. The namesake of the studio and director of the film, Edna, even made an appearance, much to the elation of fans. And so with belated breath, the film began to roll.

A countdown appeared on screen, and then black fades into bright white. The audience loudly cheers and claps. The screen remains white. The audience's excitement calms down, anxious with what could be coming.

Several minutes pass, nothing changes. Some members of the audience begin to express discontent.

""What's going on? Is there a problem?""

Luckily with the director in the room watching along, he could soothe their fears.

""Do not worry my friends, this is all a part of the experience!""

And so with reassurance by the film's creator, the audience settled down and focused their attention on the screen in anticipation. 

Several more minutes passed. People were starting to get uncomfortable. Nothing was playing, and the projector had been making strange noises within a few minutes of this white screen. Just when people were getting ready to leave, they saw movement.

A small black speck on the white screen began to move erratically. 

There was confusion and hushed whispers. What's happening? Is this a part of the movie? They all watched with rapt attention as this small fleck bounced around, leaving and coming back from all angles.

Finally an irate spectator yelled out:

""Oi, this ain't even the movie! That's just a goddamn fly buzzing around the screen!""

Clearly the projector had stopped working and the film wasn't playing. The crowd began to leave but in an attempt to save face, the director stood up once more.

""Friends please, do not leave, that fly isn't real, it's a part of the film!""

Angry with having wasted so much time and energy on this botched premiere, someone shouted out

""What on earth are you talking about? This was a failed release! Besides, why would that fly be a part of the film?""

In reply, the director answered:

""Because dear friends, at Best Edna Studios, that is not just a bug, it is a feature!""",There was a new movie in town that everyone was talking about,1

He drives up to the farm, gets out of the car with his briefcase, and walks up to the door.  On his way, he glances at the fenced in area attached to the barn where he sees a large hog staring at him.  He does a classic double-take as it registers on him that this pig only has 3 legs.

He knocks on the door and an old farmer in overalls answers.  ""Howdy, sir, I'm working with United Insurance and I'm here---well doggone it, I just gotta ask you first:  I noticed your pig only has three legs.  What's the story?""

The farmer spits and say, ""Well, you see, a few years back my wife left the stove on at night.  The flame caught a greasy napkin and while we were sleeping the kitchen caught fire and the house filled with smoke.  Of course, we never would have known that except for that pig.  That pig must've smelled the smoke, hopped the fence, busted into the house and damned if he didn't drag me, the missus, my youngest son, and the cat out of our beds and onto the front lawn.  Firemen showed up and doused it before the whole house went up but that pig saved our lives.""

""And that's how he lost his leg?  Saving you?""

""Nah, that wasn't it.  See about a year ago--this is about a year after the fire--a couple desperate fellas broke out of prison and stole a car.  The cops were hot on their tail but these two lost 'em and headed out as far into the sticks as they could.  They pulled up here at the farm.  These two tied us all up, grabbed all our money and belongings and were arguing about how to kill us when that pig busts right through the barn door, launches himself at the first con knocking him out.  He grabbed the guy's gun in his mouth, aimed it at the second one and darned if he didn't stare that second one down so bad he dropped his gun and surrendered to the pig.  The pig frees us and we called the cops who hauled them both back to jail.""

""So the pig--he lost his leg in the tussle?""

""Naw, not then.  No, about six months ago--about April--we were doing our taxes.  We'd had a couple bad years with crops and such and we just couldn't see how we could avoid losing the place.  We were in a terrible place.  Now that pig, somehow he gets into the office in the barn, sees all the forms and paperwork.  He stayed up all night while were asleep, crunching numbers, shifting figures from one place to the next, discovering a few little pockets of savings we forgot about.  Well, I tell you, I was astounded.  There on the desk was my tax form and not only were the finances in good enough shape to keep the farm, we got a tidy little return to boot.""

""Ok, that's great, but how in the hell did the pig lose his leg doing that?""

""Oh, it's like this, mister:  A pig like that you don't eat all at once.""

singing. They trained, hours every day, refining
their voices and their art. Their song floated
down the mountainside, enriching the lives and
souls of the townspeople below

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th
birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully
intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within
miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very
core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.
And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was
Sam, and Sam was the first person in history
to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that
musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one
before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.
This time, the town below was so impacted
that no one moved, spoke, or even blink for
several minutes after. As the golden sound finally
tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had
found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town
had realized there was a pattern involved. This
time, all of the townspeople were present in the
monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit
the glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepure
joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.
Words cannot do justice to the experience. The
town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people
pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical
Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that
is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as nor
mal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the
start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this
new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and
discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and
was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his
resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part
of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously
combusted! The two closest monks on stage
were burned by the flames coming off of his
body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon
the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle,
everyone made it out, except for poor Sam

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning
monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the
order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it
obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Everybody had heard of the famous shakespear, and wanted to know what he was up to now, so they often came to visit him at his pet store. They would often buy his pets too, just so they could say that they bought a pet from shakespear himself.

One day, all his animals had been rehomed except for two old, mangy cats. One orange tabby, and one solid black. Nobody wanted these cats, as they would hiss at anybody who tried to touch them.

Eventually, an old lady comes in, looking for a cat. Shakespear, exasperated, shows her the two cats that he has left. Miraculously, the black one immediately starts rubbing his head on the lady's leg and purrs loudly. Shakespear is overjoyed, and exclaims ""there you go! The perfect kitty for you!""

The lady becomes reluctant however, and says ""but look at all the beautiful patterns of that orange one!""

After looking for a few more seconds, she turns back and says to herself, ""but this one is so friendly...""

She repeats this many times, looking back and forth, unable to choose. Eventually, shakespear runs out of patience, and yells at the lady ""WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT DAMMIT,

After having no luck for 4 hours under the sun, he decided to take a short rest underneath a gigantic tree. He set his briefcase of hats down, took one out to cover his face, and laid down on the grass. With the shade from his hat and the warmth of the ground beneath him, he felt drowsy and quickly fell asleep. When he woke up an hour later, he was startled to find that his briefcase was open, and his hats were missing.

He then heard a curious sound above him. only to notice that the tree was filled with chatty monkeys all wearing his hats! He quickly tried offering them sticks or dropped fruits in exchange for his hats, but the monkeys seemed to only make fun of him. Furious, he threw a stick at one of the monkeys, which resulted in a shower of thrown sticks back at him. Ducking for cover, he backed off to another nearby tree where he thew his hat down in frustration. To his amazement, the monkeys, seemingly copying him, threw their hats down as well! He quickly picked up his hats and ran away. 

The hat maker went on to have a very successful business, getting married and having many children and eventually grandchildren. He passed on his knowledge of the trade to his oldest son before retiring, who upheld the family business and eventually passed it on to his oldest son as was tradition.

&amp;nbsp;

A few generations passed, and the new owner and grandson of the hat maker was selling hats on a hot day, when he too decided to take a short rest underneath a very similar tree. One thing lead to another, and he found himself waking up to his hats having been stolen by monkeys! However, he remembered the old story his grandfather had told him about outwitting some monkeys, and threw his hat down. A single monkey climbed down the tree and took the hat before making a rude gesture and scurrying back up. Stumped and enraged, he screamed at the monkey. 

&amp;nbsp;

The monkey replied: ""Hey idiot, you're not the only one with a grandfather"".",Just heard this variation on an oldie!,38

As he walks by, he hears the most beautiful, gorgeous, blissful music coming from the inside of the church. Curious, and eager to find out what the source of such a magical noise could be, he opens the great wooden door and rushes in to find a humble, old priest bent over the alter, praying, while the music continues on in the background. Rushing over to the priest the man says ""My dear sir! What is that beautiful music I hear echoing through this gorgeous church? What is the source of such a wonderful sound?"" The old Catholic priest smiles and turns to the man, his old bones having slowed him down in his old age. Looking up at the man with bemusement, ""I wish I could tell you."" he croaks. Slightly frustrated, the man pulls at his hair, desperate to know the source of the music. ""Well then why can't you tell me?"" The priest laughs again. ""If you want to know, you must become a Catholic priest for at least 20 years, as I did, many years ago, before I tell you of the source of this noise. Only a Catholic priest can see the source of the noise."" The man quickly thanks the old priest, and with increased vigor, and an unquenchable thirst to find out what the source of the noise is, decides he will become a Catholic priest for 20 years to find out what the source is. Interestingly enough, not many people were applying to become Catholic priests at the time, didn't seem to be quite a popular job, but the man persevered, and became a Catholic priest. The job was demanding, and he wasn't particularly good at it, but come 20 years, the man, now old and feeling about as frail as the priest he had met 20 years ago, makes his way to that Catholic church he stumbled upon two decades ago, ready to discover the source of the noise. The man opens the great wooden door of the church and finds the same old priest bent over the alter. The aged priest looks so old he could practically whither to dust before the mans eyes. Eager that the past 20 years had finally come to its culmination, the man rushes up to the old priest and proudly declares his accomplishment. ""I've done it!"" he says proudly. ""I did what you said, and I've been a Catholic priest these past long 20 years. Will you show me the source of this gorgeous, this lovely music now?"" Slowly moving his head to look up at the man, as if afraid to injure himself, the kindly old priest nods. ""You have done well, and come at the proper time too. I feel as though my time here on this earth is up, and it is now time for you to know what the source of this music is, and for you to now watch over the source of the "" he grabs at the mans arms. ""Pull me up, for I am an old man now, and my legs are weary."" The two of them hobble to the old priests office, tucked away across the chapel. The old Catholic priest unlocks the door to his office, and opens up a drawer in his desk, before pulling out a rusty, old fashioned key. The man and the priest slowly make their way across the chapel to an ancient, plain looking wooden door. The priest unlocks the door to reveal a dark flight of wooden stairs that lead down. The duo make their way down the stairs, and walk down a deep dank, dimly lit passageway. They walk for about a solid 20 minutes before they reach a solid looking, but plain, iron door. The music is louder than it was before, and the man figures the source has to be just behind the solid, but plain, iron door. He tries the handle, but its locked. The old priest lets out a laugh. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door, its in my office."" The man chuckles, although a little annoyed. ""It can happen to the best of us."" The two of them leave the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, iron key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, and back to the plain iron door. The old priest unlocks the plain iron door, and the two of them make their slow passage down a long, but steeply declining hallway until the two of them come across an ominous pristine stainless steel door, looming ahead of them. The music is even louder then it was before. The old priest moves to unlock the door, when he stops and smacks his forehead. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" The man grimaces, but masks the rest of his frustration as the two of them leave the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, steel key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, and back to the ominous stainless steel door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the stainless steel door, and the two of them continue down a rustic, stone hallway. They walk for a while before the man notices the noise is even louder than before, and the two of them come across a polished bronze door. The old priest moves to unlockd the door, when he stops and smacks his forehad. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" His temper building, the man grudgingly follows the old priest away from the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, bronze key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, and back to the polished bronze door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the polished bronze door. The man and the old priest make their way down a sleek metallic hallway, and the man notices that the gorgeous, beautiful music is even louder then it was at the bronze door. They continue walking till they reach a splendid silver door, its craftsmanship exceedingly fine, the music louder than ever. The old priest pauses before opening this door. ""Forgive me,"" he says, bending over. ""I am an old man, and my body is not what it used to be."" The man shrugs. Who was he, to judge this elder for weariness? They wait for a moment before the old priest moves to unlock the splendid silver door, when he sotp and smacks his forehead. ""Don't tell me-"" the man starts, when the old priest cries ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" His temper building, but still longing to know what the source of the music is, the old priest and the man leave the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, silver key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, and back to the splendid silver door. The old man fumbles with his key for a bit before he unlocks the door, and the two of them go down a flight of polished obsidian stairs, till they reach a gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door, the music now the loudest it had ever been, practially deafining, but all the more beautiful and gorgeous. The man falls to his knees at the gem encrusted golden door, he could spend an eternity here, and still not fully appreciate its beauty. ""Don't worry."" the priest says. ""This is the final door to the source of the music."" The man is grateful, his quest if finally at its end, the wait finally over. The old priest moves to unlock the door, before smacking his head. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" The man can forgive the old priest for his awful, awful memory at this point. It's the last door after all, and he can stand just one more trip with the old priest to his office. The two of them leave the gem encrusted, golden door, back up the polished obsidian stairs, go through the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, golden key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, through the splendid silver door, down the polished obsidian stairs, and back to the gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door. The old priest and the man reach the door, before the old priest stumbles, grabbing at the mans arm. ""My boy,"" he says, practically grasping for breath. ""My boy,"" he repeats ""my time here on this earth is now coming to a close."" He clutches at his chest. The man urgently makes a move to move the old priest up so he can carry him to a hospital. The old priest however, stops him. ""No my boy, I wish to die here, next to this golden door I have long cherished, listening to this music that I have long protected."" He slides down, laying against the wall adjacent to the golden door. ""I entrust you now, with both the protection of this church, and this music. Can you do that for me, my boy?"" Tears streaming down the mans eyes, he clasps  the old priests hands, taking the golden key. ""I will"" he stutters. ""I will."" And before the mans eyes, the old priest dies, at peace. The man now solemnly turns to the gorgeous golden door, and unlocks it, the gorgeous music now playing as crystal clear as ever, the source of the music shown to him at last, inside revealing a vast open room, and in the center of it sits—I'm sorry, I can't tell you. You're not a Catholic priest.",A Man is walking down the street when he finds a Catholic Church,8

After three months panning for gold he hasnt had any luck finding gold so to drown his sorrows he goes to the local whorehouse.

He says to the man sitting at the front desk: ""I'd like a woman for the night""
to which the man replies: ""well we only have one girl available and i must warn you her nickname is sandpaper sally""
The man thinks about this for a minute and ultimately goes on his way

Three months go by and he hasnt found any gold so he goes back to the whore house (increasingly more horny than he was before) and has a similar exchange with the man at the desk.

Again the man goes on his way.

Finally 6 more months goes by and hes finally found gold. So much gold in fact that hes richer than anyone ever should be. So he strolls back into the whorehouse and says to the man:
""I would like your finest woman for the night!""
The man responds:
""Well sir we only have one girl available and i must warn you her nickname is sandpaper sally""

Then man doesnt even hesitate and says:
""Alright fuck it lets go!""

So the man leads him upto a room and a few minutes later in walks the most drop dead gorgeous woman he's ever laid eyes on. Now keep in mind hes gone a year without sex so he skips the foreplay and just goes for it. And after a few thrusts he stops because it feels like there are two sheets of sandpaper rubbing along both sides of his dick. He pulls out and looks at her and says:
""Im sorry sally, i cant do this your vagina feels like sandpaper."" 
She responds: ""give me a few minutes"" 
And goes into the bathroom

She comes out about 5 minutes later and asks him to try again and against his better judgement he does. Greatest sex hes ever had they go at it for hours.

About 5 or 6 hours later theyre laying in bed and he looks at her and says: ""you went into the bathroom, what did you do?""

""Oh i picked the scabs and let the pus run!""",Sandpaper sally,2

Everywhere he went, crowds would gather to see him perform his Montblanc mastery.  Men wanted to be him, and women wanted to be with him.

This all changed one fateful spring day.  The magician arrived in Barcelona to perform the last show in this seasons tour, only to find out that he hadn't sold a single ticket yet.  

Devastated, he took to the streets to perform and hopefully drum up some interest in his show.  Everywhere he went the people would hardly look at him, no one would shake his hand, watch his performance, or even acknowledge his increasingly desperate carnival barker-esque calls for attention.

No one gave any attention to his tricks, not the moving mark, the blinking blot, or the blue to black bamboozle.

The magician gave up late afternoon when he got hungry and found an old man with a food cart.  

Frustration was visible on the magicians face so the old man asks ""what's got you down?"", the magician responds ""I've been selling out shows throughout Europe but here people won't even take 30 seconds to watch my Stupefying Signature trick, no one will shake my hand or even look at me, if I'd have known I would never have come here"".

The old man smiled kindly and told him ""do not be hard on yourself, there's no way you could have known, my friend""

""Why do you say that?"" inquired the magician?

So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, ""Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?""

Nate slaps his tail on the ground and a gallon of fresh, pure water appears, which the guy proceeds to drink.

""What's your second wish?"" Nate asks. The guy thinks for a second and says, ""I wish I was a king.""

Nate says, ""That's easy!"" slaps his tail on the ground, and a horse-drawn carriage arrives, with a driver, who leaps down and hands the guy a scepter and a crown, and holds the door open for the guy.

The guy gets in and thanks Nate, who asks ""Alright, what's your final wish?""

The guy says, ""I wish this desert was a beautiful kingdom, with green rolling hills, and a magnificent castle for me to live in.""

Nate thinks about it and says, ""Well, that's kind of a lot. Tell ya what, I'll fulfill your final wish, but somewhere in your kingdom I'm gonna hide a lever. And if that lever is switched to the off position, all your wishes will disappear and you'll be back crawling through the desert. Is that fair?""

The guy agrees, Nate slaps his tail on the ground and the desert is transformed into a beautiful kingdom with green rolling hills and a magnificent castle off in the distance. So the guy gets into the carriage and tells the driver to set off for the castle. They start moving along at a pretty good clip when suddenly they hit a bump and the driver goes flying off.

So the guy is freaking out, he climbs up to the driver seat and grabs the reigns but the horses won't slow down. He's pulling hard for them to stop, when he sees Nate up ahead right next to a big lever in the middle of the road.

He comes to surrounded by townsfolk worried that their king is injured, but he's alright. He gets up and walks over to inspect the lever. It's still in the on position, but next to it is the flattened corpse of the magical talking snake.

One of the townspeople comes up to him and ask, ""Why? Why, m'Lord? Why did you run over the magical snake?""

The guy looks down, and under his breath he mutters, ""Better Nate than lever.""","A guy is crawling through the desert, about to die of thirst and he comes across a magic talking snake...",96

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.


The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. 


The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. 


And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

His friend agrees. They enter the church, sit close to the front, and choose a guy.

Fifteen minutes pass, and their plan is working well. Thirty minutes, no issues.

By the time forty-five minutes pass, they've gotten used to the routine. Suddenly, while everyone is seated, the priest says something in French and the gentleman they chose stands up. Without thinking, the two Americans stand up as well.

The church bursts into hard laughter.

Realizing that no one else is standing up, the two American men leave in embarrassment. They wait for the Mass to end, and then approach the priest, who spoke English.

""We're well-meaning people- we don't speak French and just chose some guy to imitate while praying,"" one says.

The priest chuckles. ""Ah. You're probably wondering why everyone laughed at you.""

""Yes,"" replied the other American.

""Well, you see, I announced the Baptism of a child... and asked for the father of the child to stand up.""

He wakes up the next morning on the floor of a room with only a white painted ceiling and floor. No walls. Just clouds as far as he can see. In the middle of the room, there is a ladder with a sign next to it that says, ""Climb this ladder to success.""

He thinks, *why not*, and begins to climb. When he steps off onto the next floor, he sees the room he is now in has a single bed and nothing more than the ladder he stepped off of and another sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" He decides to continue climbing. 

On the next floor, he sees a single bed next to a nightstand with a $20 bill on it. He ponders for a moment, but then decidees to continue climbing. Again, another sign: ""Climb this ladder to success."" As he climbs, each floor becomes more elaborate and his emotions start running high. *Is this his chance? Can this be true? Can he really find success by climbing this ladder?*

After he climbs for what feels like an eternity, he pauses to catch his breath. He stops in a room adorned with beautiful furniture. Silk sheets cover a massive bed. Columns made of marble corner the wall-less room. A chandalier of diamonds hangs from the ceiling over the bed. And everything is adorned with gold. *This could be it!* But he notices the ladder hasn't reached the top yet and there is still a sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" 

*What could be futher up!?* He must find out. So he continue to climb.

After what seems like hours, and seeing beautiful things he could never imagine on each floor he passes, he finally reaches the top of the ladder. In front of him, there is a sign with an arrow pointing ahead. It says, ""This way to success."" He looks further ahead and sees a giant throne. Sitting on the throne is a giant naked man; the ugliest and most repulsive man he's ever seen. He approaches the throne and asks, ""Are you the one who can lead me to success?

The grotesque beast of a man replies, ""Nay, you are already here."" With a smirk and a wink, the beastly figure says, ""I'm Cess.""

post,b3rsi6,2qh72,jokes,false,1553181723,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b3rsi6/the_casket/,self.jokes,,"One day i was walking home from work when all of a sudden i hear 'bang bang bang' behind me. I turned around to see what is making the noise an i see nothing. I carry on walking but after a while i hear the same noise but even louder. It sounds like someone hitting a wooden fence on the ground. I turn around once more and i see a huge casket, ones you use for bodies during burials, just hopping towards me on the street! 

&amp;#x200B;

I stat to run and that is when i realised, its chasing me. I turn to knock at a nearby house for help, no answer. I see the casket getting closer and closer so i do what anyone would do,  break the door open. I run inside the house, close the door and push against it hoping the casket wont know where i am. However after a few second of silence, BANG BANG BANG. It is trying to break the door down, i retreat to the stairs of the house as i watch to see if it will get in. But then silence, i wonder 'is it gone' however suddenly it crashes through the door! I run up the stairs, watching as it is following me still! I lock myself in the bathroom, i realise i have cornered myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The casket starts to pound against the door, it was then that i realised i must fight back. So i gather all the items in the bathroom, i grab the toothbrushes to use as little swords against the casket, i empty out the medicine cabinet at my feet to use as throwing weapons. It was at this moment that the banging stopped again, 10 seconds went by, i began to think it had gone away! However, suddenly it bursts through the door! I throw the toothbrushes at it, no good. I throw toilet roll in hopes to trip it up, no good. I look down in panic hoping to find one last hope, when suddenly i spot the cough syrup.

I pick the cough syrup, and i throw it at the casket, and yanno what happened?

&amp;#x200B;

The coffin stopped.

The first guy’s target was Beijing’s most complex interchange. He passed out due to motion sickness.

The second guy wanted to blow up a public bus in Shanghai during rush hour time. He couldn’t squeeze on any of them.

The third guy’s target was a supermarket in Shanxi. His remote detonator got stolen.

The fourth guy wanted to blow up a restaurant in Sichuan. He died from food poisoning and overly spicy food.

The fifth guy’s target was a luxury hotel in Hong Kong. He got butchered by the Triad before he could even get close to said hotel.

The sixth guy’s target was a military factory in Shenyang. He got lost in the smog and died from air pollution.

The seventh person was actually a woman. She was told to blow up a bar in Henan. She met a human trafficker and nobody has heard from her ever since.

The last guy did actually manage to blow up a building in Jiangsu and kill dozens of people. However, the Chinese media didn’t even report on the incident. When what he did was finally confirmed, it was already too late; he got executed by the organization because they thought he was lying.

After that, ISIS learned to never again mess with China.
