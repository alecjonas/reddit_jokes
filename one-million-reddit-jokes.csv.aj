The townsfolks fear it may bring disease. So the elder says - ""I will take this mosquito, and I will determine the aspects of the disease that it may bring."" The elder rips up the mosquito into pieces. He places each one into a tiny square dish and says - ""every square dish represents an aspect of the mosquito. its wings represent the speed at which the disease will spread, its body represents the strength of the illness, and its head represents how difficult it is to cure."" As he places the body parts into the square dishes, they seem to melt and take on the square shape of their containers. He then takes the dishes and says - ""now we will add them to the pot, and hoist the pot to the heavens so that the gods may tell us something about these aspects of the disease."" So he ties a noose around a small clay pot, throws in all the square dishes and some boiling water, and raises the noose on the ceremonial pole. The pot swings for a few minutes in the breeze, and just as the people start to get impatient, the elder says - ""Hush! It is done!"" He brings down the pot, and inside it is a large seed. The elder takes the seed and says - ""Hurry! We must plant this seed, and the gods will tell us what we need to know about the mosquito you brought me.""

So they plant the seed, and it sits there in the ground doing nothing. The people are wondering why the elder is watching so intently when a green stem suddenly shoots out of the ground. ""Aha!"" The elder says. ""Time to dig it up!"" So the people do, but they have a struggle unearthing the massive root that the seed has grown into. One man asks - ""O wise one, how is it possible that the root grew so fast?"" And the elder replies - ""It signifies that the disease will spread like wildfire."" The man then asks - ""And why, pray tell, is the root so big?"" And the elder answeres him - ""That is because the disease will be very severe."" Then the man asks - ""And why is it so hard to chip with a trowel?"" The elder replies with an air of finality - ""That tells us that the disease will be very hard to cure."" And, in somber silence, they keep digging. Finally, they unearth the root and the elder appraises it. He sees the shape of the root - perfectly square - and murmurs - ""Oh, dear."" The talkative man in the crowd butts in - ""What?? What's the big problem??"" And the elder says,

""Well, this disease will infect many of you. The magnitude of a vector is always equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.""

The people nod gravely. Finally, the talkative man asks, ""Okay, wise one, but you used every part of the mosquito except the legs! What are those for?"" And the wise elder answers - ""Ah, but for deterimining magnitude the legs tell you nothing if you already have the high pot and noose.""",The mosquito that brings disease...,11

However, he knew of an experimental treatment that might work, if he were willing to take the risk. The treatment consisted of implanting muscle tissue from an elephant's trunk in the man's penis.

The man thought about it for a while. The thought of going through life without ever experiencing sex again was just too much for him to bear. So, with the assurance that there would be no cruelty or adverse effect on the elephant, the man decided to go for it. A few weeks after the operation, he was given the green light to use his newly renovated equipment.

As a result, he planned a romantic evening with his girlfriend and took her to one of the nicest restaurants in the city. She was leaning over the table in a low cut shirt, and sure enough he began to feel very uncomfortable. To release the pressure, he unzipped his fly. Suddenly his penis emerged from his pants, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll, and retreated into his pants.

His girlfriend was stunned at first, but then with a sly smile on her face said: ""That was incredible. Can you do that again?""

With his eyes watering, he replied: ""I think I can, but I'm not sure if I can take another dinner roll in the ass.""",A man went to the doctor and told him that he was having trouble maintaining an erection.,19

The manager left the bar and the new bartender started serving the customers.  ""What'll you have?"" he asked one man.

""I'll have an S&amp;S,"" came the reply.

""What's an S&amp;S?"" asked the bartender.

""It's a scotch and soda.""

The new bartender realized this was one of the abbreviations the regulars used, and fixed the drink for the customer.  After a while, someone else came in and said, ""I'll have a CWL.""

The bartender said, ""CWL?  Don't tell me:  it's a Corona with lime?""  The customer nodded, and the bartender served up his order.

Eventually, a blonde sat down at the bar and said, ""I'll have a 15.""

The bartender was puzzled and asked, ""What's a 15?""

When asked what he wanted for his final meal he asked for a banana but the man controlling the chair replied with, “I’ve had it with you, i’m not giving you another banana just for you to walk away again.” The ex-train driver understood and sat down in the chair for a third time.

The Customs personnel - all old rascals - began to suspect the old lady.

One day, when she was on the scooter with the bag behind her, the customs officer told her to stop. The old lady stopped and then the inspector asked her like this:

\- Listen, granny, you come by every day, with that bag behind you. What the hell are you carrying in that bag?

The old lady smiled and replied:

\- It's sand!

Then the inspector smiled. He thought it wasn't sand at all and told the old lady to jump off the scooter to examine the bag. The old lady did, the inspector emptied the bag and there was only sand inside. Very embarrassed, he ordered the old lady to go ahead. She mounted the scooter and walked away, with the sandbag behind.

But the inspector is still wary. Maybe the old lady would spend one day with sand and the next with swag, inside that damn bag. The next day, when she passed the scooter with the bag behind her, the inspector told her to stop again. He asked what was in the bag and she replied that it was sand. The inspector examined it and it was. For a month straight the inspector intercepted the old lady and, every time, what she carried in the bag was sand.

That's when the inspector got upset:

\- Look, granny, I'm a customs officer with 25 years of service. Nobody gets it out of my mind that you are a smuggler.

\- But there is only sand in the bag! - insisted the old lady. And he was about to apprehend the scooter when the inspector proposed:

\- I promise you I'll let you pass. I won't arrest you, I don't apprehend, I won't tell anyone anything, but you will tell me: what is the contraband that you are passing through here every day?

\- Do you promise not to report? 

asked the old lady.

""I promise."" replied the inspector.

85,000 people jammed into Sanford Stadium. National television audience. This game is on the Armed Service Network. People in Switzerland are seeing this ballgame. Going everywhere.  
The band cranks up “Glory, Glory to Ole Georgia” and our team comes running out. 85,000 stand as one.  
We are led by our gallant mascot, UGA-U-G-A. What a dog! What a gorgeous dog. What a symbol of ferocity. But UGA ain’t real smart. UGA did not realize he was at a football game. Nor did he realize he was on national television, and was going into living rooms the width and breadth of this great nation.  
And there, in front of all them people, he began to lick himself where dogs occasionally want to lick themselves, ok?  
We don’t have to get any more graphic than that.

He noticed that the plates were a little grimey and the silverware looked dirty. So, he asked his grandfather “do you wash your dishes well.” The grandfather simply replied “they’re as clean as cold water will get them.” 

The next week he made another trip to his grandfathers house. Again, the grandfather cooks a beautiful dinner that tastes delicious.

The next week they meet again at the grandfather house. This time, upon noticing the dirty dishes, the grandchild says, “grandfather, I’m going to help you wash the dishes after dinner.” The grandfather only says “okay, but they’re as clean as cold water will get them.” 

After dinner they carried the dishes into the kitchen. The grandfather began to set the dishes on the floor. The grandchild, confused, decided to see what he was up to. After the dishes were arranged on the floor, the grandfather says “come here cold water” as his dog runs in.",A grandchild goes to visit his grandfather who recently became a widower.,3

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",A politician dies...,400

 ""Sir, Valerie is one of our most expensive ladies. Perhaps you would prefer someone else"", said the madam. 

 He replied, ""No, I must see Valerie."" 

 Just then, Valerie appeared and announced to the man she charged  $10,000 a visit. Without hesitation, the man pulled out ten thousand  dollars and gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour,  the man calmly left. 

 The next night, the man appeared again, once  more demanding to see Valerie. Valerie explained that no one had ever  come back two nights in a row as she was too expensive. ""There are no  discounts. The price is still $10,000."" 

 Again, the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left. 

 The following night the man was there yet again. Everyone was astounded  that he had come for a third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie and  they went upstairs. After their session, Valerie said to the man, ""No  one has ever been with me three nights in a row. Where are you from?""  The man replied, ""St. Louis."" ""Really,"" she said. ""I have family in St.  Louis."" 

 ""I know,"" the man said. ""Your sister died, and I am her  attorney. She asked me to give you your $30,000 inheritance.""

As a kid, he was bullied in school. As an adult, he caught coworkers making fun of him when they thought he couldn't hear. He would even notice cashiers trying to stifle their laughter. No woman would ever go out with him, and he felt resigned to a life of solitude, all due to his minor speech impediment.

Jolene was fat. She always had been, and nobody would let her forget it. Acquaintances, close friends, even family members: she had lost many relationships after learning what people were saying about her. One thing she always had, though, was music. Jolene *loved* heavy metal. The deafening, inescapable rage soothed her nerves whenever life got too hard, but it could never soothe her loneliness.

One particularly rough day, Paul's gloominess suddenly turned to shock when he received a notification from Tinder- *he had a match!* ""Thurely this mutht be a mithtake,"" he said to himself. After too many heartbreaking experiences with first dates, he had decided to mention his lisp in his bio, and with his average looks, nobody had liked his profile since.

Although he had already dismissed all hopes in his head, he still decided to check the match, both out of curiosity and to clear the notification. When he opened the app, he found that the woman in the profile was *beautiful*! He couldn't believe someone like her could have read about his lisp and still swiped right. At first he thought she may have just skipped the bio, but he knew that no woman so pretty would have liked him based on his pictures alone. He *had* to know what was going on here.

It may have seemed heavy-handed, even to him, but he sent the woman a message that said, ""hey idk if u read my bio, but just so u know, i have a lisp."" He didn't expect to hear from her again, but he had to get that out of the way.

To his absolute *shock*, however, he received a notification from Tinder only 2 minutes later. ""i saw that in ur bio :)"", it said. Paul couldn't believe it. She knew about his lisp, and she had still liked him! The two of them got to talking, and before long, they had arranged to meet!

That Saturday evening, Paul pulled up in front of the town event center and waited outside. As he was glancing at his phone, he heard a voice.

""Hey, are you Paul?""

He most certainly *was* Paul! He looked up to meet the voice, and-

...

That was strange. Why was this random, rather large, lady asking him his name? And then it hit him...

""Oh! Are you Jolene?""

""Yeah,"" she said.

Paul had to say something, but he didn't want to be rude. ""You look a lot different than your picthure.""

""Oh yeaaahhh..."" she said. ""That's my sister's picture. I should probably take that down.""

Paul was understandably annoyed that his date had used a fake picture to lure him in, but in all honesty, he didn't mind her size. He of all people knew what it was like to be judged and ridiculed by people who didn't appreciate him for his personality. He dropped the subject and suggested they go inside to enjoy the concert.

Both of them were excited to be on the date, but each had something bugging them. Paul had agreed to see Disturbed, but in truth- he hated heavy metal. He didn't even consider it music.

On the other hand, Jolene was absolutely thrilled to be doing something she loved with a date! However, her prior interaction with Paul had left her thinking he was disappointed with the way she looked. She thought he could never truly love her, and when she smiled at him, and in return, received a happy expression that looked more forced than anything, she took it as a sign. About half-way through the concert, she ran off.

Paul immediately ran after her, and he found her sobbing outside the front door.

""Hey, what'th wrong?"" he asked.

""I can tell you're not having fun,"" she cried. ""It's okay. Everyone else always feels the same way.""

Paul had no idea she was talking about her weight. He just thought she had figured out that he didn't share her taste in music- definitely nothing to cry over! Laughing, he bent down to comfort her:

""Hey, if you can ackthept this terrible lithp, I'm thure I can try to get down with the thickness.""",A man with a lisp went on a blind date to a heavy metal concert,31

He saved his Bible in the shipwreck, so he maintained a prayerful life despite being stranded.  The island was full of fruit and wildlife that he could hunt, so he survived well.  Every day he swims out to a channel to see if any ships would pass through.  Day after day, for several years, he continued this routine.

One day, when swimming out to the channel, he sees a ship.  He calls out to them, and they rescue him!  He is brought to the captain who marvels at his story of survival.  He asks the captain ""Can I go back to the island to retrieve my belongings?  Some of my things are very important to me.""

The captain agrees and sends two crew members with him on a rowboat.  They ask him questions about his survival, eagerly hearing how this man bested the wild for all these years.  Approaching his living area, the crew members see three huts.  *One man with three huts*, they wonder, *what could he possibly do with them?*

""What is that leftmost hut used for?"" asked a crew member.

""That's my house, where I ate and slept,"" answered the Calvinist.

That made sense.  ""What is that middle hut used for?"" he followed up.

""That is my church, where I go to pray, read Scripture, and worship God, Who has kept me alive for all these years,"" answered the devout Calvinist.

That also made sense.  But what could the last hut be for?

post,fgmwn7,2qh72,jokes,false,1583881109,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fgmwn7/a_rabbit_enters_the_bar/,self.jokes,,"A barman was on duty one night, when a rabbit enters the bar. He sits at the bar and says ‘I’ll have a cheese and onion toastie please.” The barman is amazed by this, and not knowing what to say he serves the rabbit his toastie. The rabbit eats his toastie and leaves. 
The barman tells a few of his friends about this, and the next night they come along to the bar to see if the rabbit shows up again. At exactly the same time that night he turns up, he hops over to the bar takes a seat and orders a cheese and onion toastie. The barman looks to his friends and then serves the rabbit his cheese and onion toastie. 
The next day the whole town had heard about this rabbit, and they all went to the bar to see if the rabbit turns up again. Right on schedule the rabbit turns up to the bar, he goes up to the barman and he says “can I have a cheese and onion toastie please?” The barman realises that they’ve actually run out of onions. He replies “I’m sorry, we’re out of onions but I can make you a ham and cheese toastie?” The rabbit thinks for a moment then says “yes, I guess that would be okay.” He ate his toastie and then hopped away.
The next day the barman got in touch with all of the local news stations, they were there with their cameras to see the rabbit. However, the rabbit did not show up. There was no sign of the rabbit for the next week, and the bar went back to its old quiet days. 
Then one night the ghost of the rabbit came into the bar. The barman said “dude, what happened to you? I was wondering where you’d gone. How did you die?” The rabbit then looked at the barman and said “it was mixing me toasties”",A rabbit enters the bar,6

“I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Grandpa. “How about a demonstration?”

“For 20 years,” she says, “he’s been doing these stupid things.

First, whenever we go out, he’s always looking at the floor and refuses to go near anyone. It’s very embarrassing.”

“He keeps picking his nose all the time! Even in public!”

“He said that I should never step on anyone’s toes!”
The counselor looks amused, “Actually, that means that you should not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.”

“Well, it’s another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.”
The counselor smiles. “That just means you should stay out of trouble.

John decided to go skiing with his buddy, Keith. So they loaded up John's minivan and headed north. 

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm
and asked the attractive lady who answered the 
door if they could spend the night. 

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have
this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors 
will talk if I let you stay in my house.' 

'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in 
the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. 

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they 
got on their way. 
They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

But about nine months later, John got an 
unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined 
that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. 

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, 
do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about
9 months ago?' 

'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?' 

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed 
about being found out,'I have to admit that I did.' 

'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he said,
'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why 
do you ask?' 


She just died and left me everything.'

A gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. This totally amazes the bartender, but he thinks, ""What the heck, I guess I might as well make the drink."" So he mixes the martini. 
He then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it. 

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything."" 

So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. -

""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here."" 

And the gorilla says, ""At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised.""",A gorilla walks into a bar...,24

When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the spoon?"" ""Well, ""he explained, ""the restaurant’s owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I’ll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed.

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter’s zip on his trousers. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent.""

The bartender asks him: “What’ll you have?”

The man says: “Give me three pints of Guinness please.”

So the bartender brings him three pints and the man proceeds to alternately sip one, then the other, then the third until they’re gone. He then orders three more.

The bartender says: “Sir, I know you like them cold. You don’t have to order three at a time. I can keep an eye on it and when you get low I’ll bring you a fresh cold one.”

The man says: “You don’t understand. I have two brothers, one in Australia and one in the States. We made a vow to each other that every Saturday night we’d still drink together. So right now, my brothers have three Guinness Stouts too, and we’re drinking together.”

His horse has already died of thirst. 


He's crawling through the sand, certain that he has breathed his last breath, when all of a sudden he sees an object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him. 


He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the sand and discovers what looks to be an old briefcase.


He opens it and out pops a genie. But this is no ordinary genie. 


She is wearing a FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) ID badge and a dull gray dress. 


There's a calculator in her pocketbook. She has a pencil tucked behind one ear. 'Well, cowboy,' says the genie....'You know how I work....You have three wishes.' 


'I'm not falling for this.' said the cowboy.... 'I'm not going to trust a FEMA genie.' 


'What do you have to lose? You've got no transportation and it looks like you're a goner anyway!' 


The cowboy thinks about this for a minute and decides that the genie is right. 


'OK!, I wish I were in a lush oasis with plenty of food and drink..' 


***POOF*** 


The cowboy finds himself in the most beautiful oasis he has ever seen. 
And he is surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies. 


'OK, cowpoke, what's your second wish?' 


'My second wish is that I was rich beyond my wildest dreams.'




***POOF*** 


The cowboy finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems. 


'OK, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish. Better make it a good one!' 


After thinking for a few minutes, the cowboy says... 'I wish that no matter where I go, beautiful women will want and need me.'

The husband leans over and asks his wife,

Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago?

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence 
and I made love to you.'

Yes', she says, 'I remember it well.'

OK,' he says, 'How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do 
it for old time's sake?'

Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!'

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, 

I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence.

 I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble.

So he follows them.
The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for 
support aided by walking sticks..

Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence..

 The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers.
As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..
Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen.

This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises
and moaning and screaming.

 Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed.

He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering,
 the old couple struggles to their feet and puts their clothes back on.

 The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them,

'Excuse me, but that was something else.

You must've had a fantastic sex life together.

 Is there some sort of secret to this?'

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,
