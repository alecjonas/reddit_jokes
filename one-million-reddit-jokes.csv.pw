The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he 
hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. 
Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to 
tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.

In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... . Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

'Alright,' she said, 'what's your third wish?'

just go out and buy you anything you want. Why don't you write a
letter to Jesus and pray for one instead?"" After Leroy threw a temper
tantrum, his mother sent him to his room, where he finally sat down to
write a letter to Jesus.

 Dear Jesus, I've been a good boy this year and would appreciate a new
bicycle.
Your friend,
Leroy. 

     Now, Leroy knew that Jesus really understood what kind of boy he
was - a brat - so Leroy ripped up the letter and decided to give it
another try.

Dear Jesus, I've been an OK boy this year, and I want a new bicycle.
Yours truly,
Leroy Well, Leroy knew this wasn't totally honest either, so he tore
it up and tried again. Dear Jesus, I've thought about being a good boy
this year, and can I have a bicycle?
Leroy 

    Leroy looked deep down into his heart (which, by the way, was what
his mother really wanted). He knew he had been terrible and was
deserving of almost nothing. He crumpled up the letter, threw it in
the trash can, and went running outside. He aimlessly wandered about
the streets, depressed because of the way he had treated his parents.
For the first time, he really considered his actions. Leroy finally
found himself in front of a Catholic Church. He went inside and knelt
down, looking around but not knowing what he should really do. Leroy
finally got up and began to walk out the door and was looking at all
the statues. All of a sudden, he grabbed a small statue and ran out
the door. He went home, hid it under his bed, and wrote this letter:


Jesus, I've got your mama. If you ever want to see her again, give me
a bike.
From,
You know who.
","Bad, Bad Leroy!",7

It is now time for the groom to kiss his bride. The pastor sees this as the perfect opportunity to ask to be paid. He pulls the young man aside and asks him, “Can you please pay me now?”

Although annoyed by this, the pastor realizes he has himself to blame. He continues the ceremony and says, “You may now kiss the bride .”

She was pretty huge and popular, because of how dedicated she was. 

There was this one couple that walked in, their problem being that they always had extreme arguments after playing Scrabble. This was a unique case for Aileen, as she never tackled a problem like this before. She realized that maybe the couple was disagreeing on the rules of the game, and spent most of her effort in the coming weeks trying to solve this, sometimes even monitoring their games from far to train them and make sure they played nicely. She spoke to them individually and as a couple, and they left, finally satisfied that they were able to find a solution.

Weeks later, one evening the girl asked, ""How about a game of Scrabble tonight?""

The guy responded, ""Sure! For old times sake.""

They set up the board, and the game was going perfectly fine for a few rounds, until in one round, the girl placed her tiles right next to an existing word, but it didn't make sense.

The guy exclaimed, ""Honey, OPIUM is a word, but you're putting it next to ADAPT. AP and TU are not words!""

The girl responded, ""I thought that doesn't matter. I thought beforehand that this is permitted. Let's not turn this into anything.""

In response, the guy said, ""Honey, Wuornos trained us to love. You know the rules, and so do I.""","Before being a serial killer, Aileen Wuornos was actually a dating counselor.",0

Bill was bragging to his boss a day ago ""You know, I know a lot of pals. A *lot*. Pick any guy, famous or not, and I probably know him.""

To confront this boring boasting, his boss calls his bluff. ""Ok Bill, how about Tom Hanks?""

""No worry boss,"" says Bill, ""Tom is an old pal of my own, I will show you"" So Bill and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Hanks's door, and Tom Hanks shouts,

""Bill! What's going on? You must sit down with us, drink a pint!""

Although this was most stunning, Bill's boss was still curious, for what if Bill was just lucky?

""No, no, which pal should I show you now?""

""Hmph, Donald Trump"" says his boss quickly.

""Trump is my most classic bud, now fly us to Washington!"" which his boss did.

At that official building of our Constitutional hub, Trump spots Bill and his boss and motions both guys towards him, saying ""Bill, what a random hookup, I was on my way to an important chat, but you and your pal must go in and drink a bit of sud with us, and catch up!""

At this point, that boss was shook but still not totally undoubting. So that boss says to Bill ""What about that holy man Francis?

""Unconditionally! Pals for so long, many months, that holy man and I."" And so his boss took Bill to Italy.

In that Vatican's hangout, standing amid a mass of crowds, Bill said ""This just cannot work. How can I catch Mr. Francis' sight amid all this hubbub? You know what, I am pals with all his guards, so will just climb upstairs and stand upon that high balcony with Mr. Francis."" And Bill ran through that crowd and into that Vatican.

In not half an hour, Bill shows up on that balcony standing along with Mr. Francis, that's right, Mr. Francis, but Bill ran back down to find his boss laid out on asphalt having a nasty cardiovascular attack, with doctors around him.

Making his way to his poor boss, Bill asks him ""Omg you ok?? What did occur during my stand on that balcony?""

His boss looks up and says ""It was that final straw... As you and Mr. Francis stood on that balcony, a random man to my right said ""Who dafuq is that, standing on that balcony with Bill?""
","Y'all know Bill, right?",58

*By that logic, they couldn't execute me on Saturday either. Since I know it can't be Sunday on Friday night I'll know that I'll die tomorrow.*

After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.

The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table, the interviewer asked, 'What is the fastest thing you know of?'

The first man replied, 'A THOUGHT.' It just pops into your head. There's no warning.

'That's very good!' replied the interviewer. 'And, now you sir?', he asked the second man.

'Hmmm...let me see 'A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of.'

'Excellent!' said the interviewer. 'The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliché for speed.' He then turned to the third man, who was contemplating his reply.

'Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. 'Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of'.

The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. 'It's hard to beat the speed of light,' he said.

Turning to BUBBA, the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question.

Old Bubba replied, 'After hearing the previous three answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA.'

'WHAT!?' said the interviewer, stunned by the response.

'Oh sure', said BUBBA. 'You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I had already s**t my pants.'

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

A teacher was teaching her second grade class about the government, so for homework that one day, she told her her students to ask their parents what the government is.
When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask his what the government was.
His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''
''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of s**t!''",A lesson in government,0

""There, you will come to the Den of the Grey Lions,"" continued the female dolphin. ""Be careful not to wake them. There is a bridge that passes over their den; you must, quietly, travel over that bridge. And finally, you must obtain the Chalice of Knowledge. Return that and the bird to us, and we will answer any of your questions.""

The young man ventured into the forest in search of the Golden Mina Bird, but first came across the Asp of Contrition. The Asp warned the young man, ""beware what you see and beware where you stray, for none have returned when they go on this way."" The man continued nonetheless, asking the Asp if he had seen the bird, and the Asp, with a slither, brought the young man to the creature he sought. The man easily captured the bird, putting it in the golden, silk bag, and went off toward the lions' den -- ignoring the snake's warning.

The lion's den was enormous -- it seemed to stretch for miles in either direction. But, as the dolphins predicted, the lions were asleep. And the bridge, while narrow and ricketty-looking, was easily accessible. The young man walked to the bridge, crossing it on tip-toes, passing over the sleeping lions unnoticed.

And then, the young man spotted the Chalice of Knowledge. But before he could get it, he was arrested for transporting a mina over slate lions for immortal porpoises.

They  re driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It is late, raining very hard and Bob can barely see the road in front of the car.   Suddenly, the car skids out of control. Bob attempts to control it, but to no avail.    The car swerves and smashes into a ditch..

Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees Betty unconscious, with her head bleeding. Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to get her medical assistance. He carefully picks her up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light and heads towards it, which is coming from a large, old house. He approaches the door and knocks.  A small, hunched man opens the door.

Bob blurts, “Hello, my name is Bob Hill and this is my wife Betty. We’ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been Seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?”

 “I’m sorry,” replies the hunchback, “but we don’t have a phone. My master is a doctor. Come in, and I will get him.”

Bob brings his wife in.

 An older man comes down the stairs. “I’m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor;   I am a scientist.  However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had some basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.”

With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab.  Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table.

After a brief examination, Igor’s master looks worried. “Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion.”  Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more.

The Hills’ deaths upsets Igor’s master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. It is here that he has always found solace and he begins to play.  A stirring, almost haunting melody fills the house.

Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty’s hand twitch, keeping time to the haunting piano music. Stunned, he watches as Bob’s arm begins to rise, marking the beat. He is further amazed as Betty and Bob both sit up straight!

Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master:

“Master, Master! The Hills are alive with the sound of music!” ",A Dark And Stormy Night In Transylvania,18

The date he had the night before left him with blue balls. He was desperate, so he drove around town looking for a quick lay. He saw an old woman standing on the corner... 

""No....,"" he thought. Then he drove around the block again. 

After circling the block ten more times, he saw the same lady again. 

""Fine..."" he thought. He yelled, ""How much?""

""Twenty dollars,"" the old lady said.

""Great! Hop in!""

So they drove to the nearest motel. They found a room, and he quickly dragged her in and closed the door behind them. 

John got a closer look at the old woman, and she didn't look too bad. So he quickly undressed her and started doing his business...

""Why is it so rough?"" John asked. 

""What do you mean? Hold on... try again,"" the old lady said. 

""Ouch! It's even more rough than before..."" John yelled!

""Hold on try again..."" she said. 

""Ow! It hurts!""

""Ok hold on. I'll be back,"" she said, as she walked in to the restroom. 

She was there for a few minutes, and she came back. ""Try again,"" she said.

While walking, one of them spots a brilliant blue bottle and picks it up, on closer inspection, it’s a lamp. He rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms ""You have finally freed me after 10,000 years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The genie says, “It’s now time for your 2nd wish.” Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to “think very carefully"" about their third and final wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

He's alarmed, but he has faith and decides to stay where he is and trust in God to rescue him.

The water starts rising and the man is forced to go to the second floor of his house. He hears a knock on the window and sees a rescue worker in a lifeboat motioning for him to climb in.

""Come on! We've got to get out of here!""

""No,"" the man replies. ""I am going to stay here and wait for God to rescue me.""

The water keeps rising, so the man climbs out the window and onto his roof. Another lifeboat floats up to him, carrying a second rescue worker, who motions for him to jump in.

""Come on! We're running out of time!""

""No, my friend,"" the man responds. ""I am going to wait for God to rescue me.""

By this point, the water is almost above the roof, and the man has to climb up to the satellite dish. A search and rescue helicopter glides above him, shining a spotlight on him and lowering a rope. He waves the chopper off, still believe that God will rescue him. Two seconds later, a bolt of lightning strikes the satellite dish and kills him. 

The man wakes up at the gates of heaven, face to face with Saint Peter.

""What happened?!"" he yells in frustration. ""I thought God was going to rescue me!""

Peter chuckles. ""I don't know what you're complaining about. He sent you two boats and a helicopter.""",A Christian is watching TV when he gets a flood warning.,46

post,5os3k1,2qh72,jokes,false,1484773535,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5os3k1/the_purple_wombat/,self.jokes,,"Once there was a boy named Billy. He had just woken up and realized he was late for school. He put on his uniform and grabbed a piece of toast and ran out of the house. As he ran out he looked down and saw the newspaper. He only looked for a split second but he saw something about a purple wombat. He stopped to go ask his dad about it but he could hear the school bell ring off in the distance.
Billy wondered what it was but he kept on running to school. When he got there he was 5 minutes late. He walked in and his teacher asked him why he was late. ""I read the newspaper and I saw something about a purple wombat and I stopped to think about it and went to ask my dad what the purple wombat was, however the bell rang before I could."" 
The teacher than said ""what.... you don't know what the purple wombat is?""
Billy answered ""No."" 
The classroom made a huge gasp as the teacher told Billy to go to the office.
In the office the principal asked ""why are you here Billy?"" 
Billy said ""the teacher sent me.""
""Why did she send you?""
""Because I asked what the purple wombat is."" 
At this the principal became mad. ""Billy get out of my office, get out of the school and only come back when you find out what the purple wombat is!"" 
At this Billy sadly walked home. When he got home his mother asked him ""why are you home so early? Are you sick?"" 
Billy said ""the principal sent me home.""
""Why""
""Because I didn't know what the purple wombat was""
Billy's mother screamed in disgust.
""WHAT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE PURPLE WOMBAT IS? Go to your room and wait till your father comes home."" 
Billy, crying, went up to his room. A few hours later he heard the front door close. He heard voices come from downstairs then a pair of feet coming up the stairs.
Billy's father came in and said. ""Your mother tells me that you were sent home. Care to tell me why?""
""I didn't know what the purple wombat was.""
At this Billy's father hollered. ""WHAT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE PURPLE WOMBAT IS? STAY IN YOUR ROOM UNTIL YOUR FIGURE IT OUT!!!""

Later that night Billy woke up to a tapping at his window. He opened it and heard a voice say ""hi Billy I'm the purple wombat!"" ""Come find me Billy!"" At this Billy snuck out of his house and entered the woods behind his house. He came to the edge of a lake. Again he heard the voice ""I'm the purple wombat! Come find me Billy!"" Billy then got into a boat and started rowing. 
About halfway out Billy heard a voice say ""Look up Billy I'm up here!"" Billy then looked up to see if he could find something. There was nothing there so he stood up to get a better look, however, the boat toppled and since Billy couldn't swim he drowned. 

Moral of the story: don't stand up in boats",The purple wombat,2

dollars out west to another ranch where a man has a prize bull for

He ignored it contributing it to the old building. The next week he heard it again. ""Sell your shop,"" the voice whispered. He continued to ignore it until the voice was speaking to him every day.

David, not being able to stand the voice any longer, sold his shoe shop for $1,000,000. ""Take your money and go to Las Vegas,"" the voice said. David complied because he knew the voice would just continue to speak to him. 

David, having landed in Las Vegas, was walking down the strip when the voice said, ""Go into the first casino you see.""

""Why? I'm not a gambler, besides all I have left is my $1,000,000."" David asked.

""Trust me, I would not lead you astray,"" the voiced answered.

David relents and goes into the first casino he sees. ""Sit down at the blackjack table,"" the voice said. 

""But I'm not a gambler,"" David said.

""Trust me. Trust in me and all will be revealed,"" the voice replied. 

David conceded and sat down at the table. ""Bet it all,"" the voiced said. 

""This is everything I have. Certainly, you won't make me do this?"" David pleaded.

""Trust me,"" the voice replied.

So, David bet his $1,000,000 on his first hand of blackjack and he got an 18.

""But I have 18,"" David replied.

""Hit again, David,"" the voice said.

""I have nineteen,"" David said.

""Trust me, my son,"" the voice said.

""Hit,"" David said to the dealer.

""Ace. Twenty,"" the dealer said.

""Oh, my God! I don't know if I can take this."" David exclaimed.

""Hit again. Trust in me, my son,"" the voice asked.

""BUT I HAVE TWENTY!!!"" David screamed at the voice.

""Trust in me. Have I lead you astray? Trust me one last time,"" the voice calmly said.

This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.

Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.

By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

In his travels he comes upon a sheep farmer from Nova Scotia, and after a short conversation is overcome with curiosity and decides to ask the farmer about his relationship with the sheep. 

""Have you ever had sex with the sheep?"" He asks. 

""Well I'm a little ashamed to admit it but we do get lonely out here and every man has his needs."" The farmer replies. 

""How do you do it?"" The young man asks. 

""Well it's simple really, you grab the sheep by its hind legs and put the in your boots, and at that point I'm sure you can guess the rest."" Says the farmer. 

At this point the young man departs from the farmers company and continues his journey. Several days later he finds himself in Newfoundland in the presence of yet another sheep farmer. Again he asks the question. 

""Have you ever had sex with the sheep?"" He asks. 

""I hate to admit to this but it's lonely out here and every man has needs."" The farmer replies. 

""How do you it?""  The young man asks. 

""Well it really is easy. You simple grab the sheep by the front legs and put them on your shoulders, then grab the back legs and put them in your boots, then your on your way."" The farmer replies. 

The young man goes on to explain that the farmer from Nova Scotia doesn't put the front legs on his shoulders and that that step is unnecessary. 

To which the farmer replies in disgust.

Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. 
Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.

Avoid heavy lifting.

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. 
He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. 
To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 
He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. 
The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:
""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. 
Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. 
They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

The boy excelled at everything he side under his guidance,and while he got into occasional mischief, he was mostly a great son.

Half way through 8th grade his birthday comes around, and the boy has a partial scholarship to high school. His dad, pleased with his son, is ready to give him anything he wants, within reason. When he asks, his son only replies ""Dad, I want one white golf ball. "" the father is a bit confused, but complies with the request, hoping this sparks an interest with golf. 

Freshman year rolls by at high school a year later, and the boy is doing well in his courses, mostly high Bs and low As, and is starting to show promise as a pitcher in baseball. The dad, knowing his sons birthday is coming up, asks him what he wants for his birthday. The son only replies ""dad, I want ten red golf balls."" The father insists on a laptop or something for baseball, but the son is adamant, so the father complies. Besides there's no harm in a couple golf balls. 

Another year goes by; the son has been moved to AP classes and is now pitching for his team. He's hard pressed and under pressure, but the boy scrapes by and pulls out decent grades. The father is non the less proud of the son for his commitment and begins saving for a car. 

The sons birthday comes around, and he tells his dad, ""Dad, I'd like 100 yellow gold balls.""

The father is mad now. Three years in a row he's asked for golf balls. In the end he still gets his son the balls and begins to wonder what he does with them. 

His junior year is here and the son is starting to shine. His pitching skills are unmatched in the division and he's gotten As in most of his AP classes. College recruiters are calling and the dad knows his son will probably get a scholarship to college. He's been saving for a car and should be able to afford something decent for his son when he asks. He's sure if it. 

When the day comes, his son asks "" dad, can I get 1000 blue golf balls for my birthday? ""

The father is in distress now, and asks his son what the hell he's doing with these golf balls, and why he even needs them. His son only replies ""dad, I don't ask for a lot, and I only ask this. If you don't get them, I don't want anything."" The father begrudgingly buys them, and figures he'll just save for a new car for the next year. 

Senior year rolls in, and it's final. He's going to a top school, full ride, abs they've won their baseball championship. The dad can't be happier and is overwhelmed with pride. His birthday is coming up, and he's managed to save for any car the boy could want.
The boy looks at his dad when he asks what he wants for his birthday and replies ""dad, I want 10000 black good balls

The dad loses his shit, and demands to know what he's been using these golf balls for. The son calms him down, and tells him he's been making something and he will show him after its done. But first he needs his birthday present. The dad complies, and with c reservation, says it better be good. 

They head out the next morning and drive by his sons directions to where his son has been placing the balls. Unfortunately, it's icy out. Another car losses control, swerved and hit their car. They wrap around a tree and the son is thrown from the car. 

The dad crawls to his son, and realizes there's not much time left.   He makes it there, and his son says, ""dad, the golf balls, they're.... uggghhh.....""

Wagon Wheel - ""Yes sir, my mama gave me that name. It was the first thing she seen after runnin out the front door.""

""No problem,"" he said again and started pulling his ears. With each pull his member grew wider and wider until the entire measurement was extremely exciting to the woman. 

""Wow!"" she exclaimed as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love. The next day the couples rejoined their normal partners and went off together.

The doctor pulls over to see what the matter is. 

""Thank God,"" gasps the man. ""You're the first car I've seen out here and I've been walking for God knows how long. My wife - our car broke down and she's having a baby! I need to get her a doctor!"" 

The doctor makes a call to the hospital, but they're out in the middle of nowhere and he's the closest person who can respond. So he lets the man into his SUV and they start driving down the road as fast as possible. The whole while the man's rocking in his seat and on the verge of panic, so to distract him the doctor says, ""Tell me about your wife. What were the two of you doing way out here to begin with?"" 

""It's all my fault,"" moans the man. ""Me and Jenny - that's my wife's name, Jenny - we wanted to live off the grid, you know? Couldn't stand the city, neither of us, couldn't stand the nine-to-five. We just wanted to live off the land, have a little something we could call our own. 

""So we bought 10 acres of land for a couple of hundred dollars. Miles away from civilization. We built our own house out of adobe, started growing our own crops - Jenny grew the most beautiful tomatoes. We raise rabbits, chickens - we just got our first pig. Drive into town every few months for what supplies we can't make on our own. There's tanks for rainwater and solar panels for what electricity we do use - no TV, no internet, no phone lines, just us and the land, all on our own."" 

""Sounds nice,"" says the doctor. 

""It's beautiful,"" says the man. ""Watching the sunsets. Seeing the wildflowers come into bloom. Knowing you're your own man, your own master, harvesting your own crops from the earth."" He puts his head in his hands and sobs. ""It's all my fault, doc. When we found out Jenny was pregnant - you're going to say it, aren't you? We should've gone to a hospital. I shouldn't've risked it."" 

""I'm not - I'm not judging you,"" the doctor says. 

""It's just -"" says the man, and looks at him imploringly. ""You can understand what we had, can't you? I wanted my kid to be a part of that. Born on the cusp of a new frontier. Part of our homestead. Part of something mom and dad built for themselves!"" 

""Of course, of course"" the doctor quickly says. 

""And women - they've been giving birth long before there was even any hospitals! So how bad could it be?"" The man clenches his hands into fists. ""We're not stupid, doc, I want you to know that. We studied up, went into town and took the classes, read the books. Talked to a midwife. We wanted to have a midwife there, but we couldn't find any available to make the trip."" 

The doctor grunts in response. 

""But Jesus,"" says the man, and stares out at the road, his eyes haunted. ""It went so wrong. It all went so wrong. Baby just wouldn't come out. Jenny started, uh, she started hemorrhaging. Blood everywhere. Amniotic membrane ruptured. Got her in the car as quick as possible when things started going wrong, I want you to know that, doc. My pride ain't worth the lives of my wife and my kid. And we were a quarter of the way to town when, fuck, the engine died. I maintained that car myself, kept it running for years. And it was just ... dead, couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with it, just me and Jenny and our kid stranded on the side of the road, in the middle of nowhere ....""

The doctor's silent at this point, just keeping his hands on the wheel and his eyes on the road, getting more and more anxious all the time and not knowing what to say. 

""I should've stayed,"" the man says out of nowhere. ""I should've stayed with her. She's no idiot, doc. Even with how much pain she was in, how out of her mind with pain she was, Jenny realized it. There was no way in hell I was going to make it to town on time, on foot. I was abandoning her. I kissed her goodbye and told her I was going for help and she clutched onto my shirt and she knew I was leaving her there to die."" The man shakes his head and then looks up at the doctor. ""But thank God I listened to that spark, that instinct in my head that said 'don't give up.' Because you were out there, doc. And I found you. And everything's going to be all right."" 

Out in front of them a car comes into sight and the man yells, ""That's it, doc! There they are!"" The doctor slows and comes to a stop, and the man leaps out the door and starts running to his broken-down car. The doctor stays in his seat, staring down at his hands, unable to move. Halfway there the man realizes the doctor isn't coming with him and rushes back and sticks his head back into the SUV. ""Doc! What are you doing! She's right over there! There's no time to waste!"" 

""Listen,"" says the doctor, and swallows. ""I'm not an obstetrician. In fact, you probably know more about delivering babies than I do. I'm just a podiatrist. There's nothing I can do to save your wife and child."" 

""Oh,"" says the man, and there's a long silence between them. ""Well, since you came all the way out here, could you at least give us a toe?"" ",A doctor is out driving on a stretch of lonely road,1

That evening they dressed for dinner and headed to their hotel's elegant restaurant, where they were seated next to a huge aquarium. Strangely, the aquarium was devoid of any aquatic life.
