The pope listened to all the sins the mafia boss had committed. ""I can give you absolution for your sins,"" the pope said ""but let me be honest. It will take a lot of work and it is going to cost you""

The pope took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered.

""Fifty million dollars"" the pope said.

That was a lot of money to the mafia boss. He had known it was going to be expensive but he had not expected it to be that expensive.

He decided to get another offer so he arranged a meeting with the patriarch in Moscow. The patriarch listened to his sins, nodded and poured himself another glass of vodka. ""I can give you absolution for your sins"" he said ""but let me be honest. It will take a lot of work and it is going to cost you""

The patriarch took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered.

""Twenty million dollars"" the patriarch said.

That was sill a lot of money so the mafia boss decided to get a third offer and arranged a meeting with the chief rabbi in Jerusalem. The chief rabbi listened to his sins and said ""I can give you absolution for your sins, no problem"".

""How much will it cost me?"" the mafia boss asked.

The chief rabbi took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered

""Two hundred dollars"" he said.

A few days later whilst herding some sheep he felt a strange sensation in his legs. A small tingling. He looked down to see hew was covered in hair from the waist down and most strangely of all, he had hooves. These new legs of his forced him to naturally bend over. He found this fall to be gracefully cushioned by another pair of hooves on his newly hairy arms. Then suddenly his vision had become so impaired he could see for more of what was beside him than what was in front of him. Then after bursting out of all of his clothes he realised...

This time he is sure the sound came from the corner of the room and peering through the darkness he realises it's coming from a birdcage. Giving a sigh of relief he goes over to the cage and sees a parrot inside and the nameplate on the cage reads ""Moses""

The thief has a little chuckle and says ""What kind of person names their parrot Moses?""

All of a sudden Saudi police rushed in and arrested them.

For their punishment the Saudi Arabia Sheik decided that the punishment should be 20 lashes with a whip.

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheik suddenly said: ""It is my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.""

The Manchester United fan was first in line (he had consumed the least), so he thought about it for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back.""

This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through it.

The Manchester United fan had to be carried away bleeding and crying when the punishment was done.

The Liverpool fan was next up (he almost finished a half-keg), and after watching the scene, said: ""Choice! Please fix two pillows on my back.""

But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again.

The Everton fan was the last one up (he had finished off the keg), but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of England, your city has some of the best and most loyal football fans in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!""

""Cheers mate, your Most Royal and Merciful highness"", the Everton fan replied.

""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave."" The Sheik said with an admiring look on his face.

""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish? What is it to be?"" the Sheik asked.

""Tie that Liverpool fan to my back...""","A Manchester United fan, Liverpool fan and an Everton fan were caught drinking in Saudi Arabia....",45

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

He comes out of the car, and tells her: ""Hello, ma'am. Could you tell me how is your Wolkswagen so fast?"" To which she replies ""Oh, dear, my car has a special engine, and everytime you say 'fuck', it goes 100mph faster."" The guy is very impressed with this and proposes a deal to the woman where they switch cars. The woman, having always wanted to try a Ferrari, agrees, and they switch keys. 

The guy climbs into the Wolkswagen and yells ""FUCK FUCK"" and the car blasts off, 200mph, down the highway. The guy is loving it, until he realizes!

She climbs into the car, and says to the man “John’s convent.” The man agrees, and begins driving to Saint Johns convent, across town. 

After a while, the man turns to the nun, and says, “sister, it has always been a dream of mine to talk to a nun”

The nun replies, in a quiet voice, “what is it you would like to talk about?”

The man, with a guilty look on his face, says to the nun, “well, it has always been a dream of mine to kiss a nun.”

The nun puckers her lips, leans in, and kisses the man on the cheek.  The man, now red in the face, says, “sister... on the lips”

The nun leans in farther and begins to passionately kiss the man. The rest of the car ride is filled with a tense silence. 

At the gates to the convent, before the nun gets out, the man says, “sister, I must confess, I am married to my wife and I have two children”

The nun climbs out of the car and replies, “I must confess something too, my name is Rodger and i am going to johns convent, the bar.”

The tiger says,""I won't kill you but only on one condition. You have to let me fuck you"". Seeing no other option the hunter says yes and the tiger has his way with him.

The hunter feels humiliated and vows to come back the next day and hunt the tiger.  So the next day the hunter arrives at the same place and waits in hiding until he spots the tiger again. This time he shoots two bullets aiming at the tiger. But the tiger is quite alert because of the events of the previous day, so he manages to evade the bullets.

The hunter starts saying his last words when the tiger comes to him and says, ""I don't think you have learnt a lesson yet. But you're a nice man, so I'll let you go. But the deal remains the same"". The tiger screws the hunter and lets him go.

Now the hunter is completely infuriated and comes back the third time deciding to kill the tiger once and for all. But the same thing happens all over and the tiger manages to go unharmed. 

Having no choice, the hunter drops his pants and leans against a tree waiting for the tiger to have his way with him. The tiger comes near the hunter, taps him gently and says, ""Do you really come here to hunt or just get fucked in the ass?"".

But the driver just keep driving, eyes fixed to the road.

""Hey, I've got an idea! Lets just both say you did it and I'll give you a thousand bucks. How does this sound?""

The bald guy just drives in silence, but suddenly his phone rings. He picks it up and listens to the caller without saying a single word, than he hung up. The car brakes sharply, turns around and drives backwards. In ten minutes they are back at Capo's house where he holds another guy kneeling at his feet on the driveway. Capo opens the back dooor, throws the second guy inside yelling ""And shot this motherfucker in the face!"".

They drive for fifteen minutes in absolute silence when the tree line appears on the horizon. Then our Romeo gently taps the driver on his shoulder.

First I didn't believe it, so I tried to stick it in my pocket, but the frog spoke again.


- There is a jar behind that tree. Trap me inside and release me once you've made sure the wishes came true.


I stopped for a second, then agreed. After placing the frog inside, I told it my three wishes.


- I want a giant mansion where my house currently is.


- Done.


- I want mounds and mounds of money.


- You got it.


- I want two hot blondes who will love me forever.


- Granted.


I didn't believe it, so I went home and checked, and sure enough, everything was as I requested. Two attractive girls walked out of the multi-million dollar mansion and greeted me with a hug, then led me to a foyer where small hills of 100$ bills were scattered across the floor.


I decided to go back to the forest to thank the frog. As I released it, it spoke again.


- You are very welcome, but I do have one small request.


- Whatever it is, I can do it. - I told it, - You've turned my life around, it's the least I can do.


- I want you to have sex with me.


It was a strange request, but the frog had done much more than that for me, so I decided to do it.


As we were having sex, suddenly the frog flashed with a bright light and turned into a cute, little fourteen-year-old girl.""

An old man in overalls greets him and says, ""Here she is"". The young lad cant believe it, its the bike he has always wanted and its in pristine condition. They have some small talk about bikes and riding stories. The old man finally says, ""I'm going to sell you the bike, I'm getting too old to ride and I see you really appreciate this model, and motorcycles in general. So i'll know you will take real good care of her."" The young gent is super excited. ""One more thing before you leave, take this bottle of vasoline, put it on the chrome if it rains to prevent rust"" The old man said. He then rides off with his newly acquired bike to pick up his girlfriend. She is excited to see him on it, and she admits he looks very hot while riding. Tonight he is meeting her parents for the first time so he wanted to make a good first impression. She jumps on and they take off to her parents house. 

""Now before we go in there is something I must tell"", she says. ""We have this crazy rule at the dinner table. If you are caught talking you have to wash the dishes"", she warned. ""It's okay, I will just focus on my meal"", he replied. When they were greeted at the door, he walked inside and he couldn't believe it. There were dirty dishes everywhere, piled up in the living room, hallways, the foyer, the stairway, and of course the kitchen. Some how, her mother was able to make dinner and they all sat down to eat.

So they are eating and the young man is getting pretty bored with the silence, the father reading his newspaper, the mother watching t.v. from the table. He is feeling a little cheeky and decides to start rubbing his girlfriends thighs till she is biting her lip. He looks up and the parents are continuing no paying attention. Then he decides to up the ante and then starts making out with her and fondling her breast. Not a peep from the parents. Then he decides, to put his girlfriend on the table and just starts fucking her on the table, really getting into it. The parents just continue to ignore the spectacle. He looks at the mom, grabs her to join and then starts fingering her on the table as well. while all this fuckery is going on the man sees its starts raining out side, he remembers and pulls out the vasoline. The father then abruptly stands up and says.

It's true! Just by feeling their hand, old man Nguyen could tell you if somebody was European, African, Polynesian, or American. He was best at Asian countries, just by practice, and could even tell what country someone was from, something he wasn't quite capable of with other ethnicities - for instance, he could tell upon meeting her that his wife Nguyet was Vietnamese, his friend Wong was Chinese, and his dentist Edgar was Singaporean.

We'l anyway, the Guinness Book of World Records eventually heard about him and sent out a team, since they'd never heard of anyone with this level of precision from simple touch. They ran several tests, asking him to hold the hands of several people and state their ethnicity. He did so, as he always had, with barely a hesitation.

Then they decided to trick him. They brought in his wife Nguyet, his friend Wong, and his dentist Edgar. All three entered the room silently.

The head researcher beckoned Wong over, and had him position himself in the same way all other tested people had been - but the researcher himself took Nguyen's hand.

""This person is European,"" Nguyen said immediately.

The researcher nodded to Wong, who said, ""No Nguyen, it's me.""

Nguyen heard Wong's voice from exactly where he would expect it. But he knew that he was holding a white man's hand, and Wong was Chinese.

""This is not your hand, Wong. This is a white man's hand.""

""That is Wong's hand, Nguyen. Have we been going too long? Do you need a break?"" The head researcher was impressed, but knew that he had to be absolutely certain about Nguyen's abilities.

Nguyen held firm. He shook his head strongly.

""If this is Wong, why does it feel so white?""","Nguyen, who saw by touch. It's original, I swear!",7

-Well, Manolo, we were waiting for you. Welcome to the purgatory. You can now reincarnate in a Bengalese tiger or an Asturian hen.

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

Take off that saddle and that feed-bag from that horse and put them on me. Then you take the horse and let me do the rest. We'll meet up at our safe house outside of town!"".

""Where is my horse?!?"" the farmer exclaims.  
  
The thief says to him: ""I'm right here, don't you recognize me? I used to be a man, just like you. But several years ago I had sex with an evil witch and she cursed me to be a horse for a long time. But the curse is over, now!""

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”
The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”
The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.
The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex the watching man has ever seen. They are bucking and jumping like eighteen-year-olds. This goes on for about forty minutes. She's yelling Ohhh God!

This is the most athletic sex imaginable. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground. The guy watching is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life that he didn't know. He starts to think about his own aged parents and wonders whether they still have sex like this. 

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The guy, still watching thinks, That was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I've got to ask him what his secret is.

One morning a young boy was walking to class when three older girls approached the boy and said well aren't you just a ""purple vein"". The boy asked but the girls giggled as they slowly rounded the block. 

After the boy got to school he saw his best friend and asked him. ""Hey I was walking to class and these three older girls called me a purple vein. Any idea what it means?"" His best friend of his short lived elementary experience looked at him with shock and disgust. Appallingly he said ""How could you!? I'm telling Mrs. Reevus!""

Mrs. Reevus comes up to the boy and asks him what is going on? The boy replies ""Well I was walking to school and these three girls called me a purple vein, then I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, do you know what it means Mrs. Reevus?"" The teacher with a sour scowl etched across her face told the boy. ""Son that is enough! Go the principle's office at once!""

They boy is waiting in the principal's office when he hears the principal behind the closed door, the boy sees his principal's shadow through the sand blasted door window. Imprinted says 'Principal McDouglas: Hopkins Elementary'. The well dressed Principal opens the door and says come on in young man. As the boy is entering the room Mr. McDouglas says ""What is the nature of your presence in my office?"" They boy replies with fear of repetition of the past but none-the-less he says ""Well I was walking to school today when three girls approached me and called me a purple vein. I got to school and asked my best friend what a purple vein was, then I talked to the teacher and asked her what a purple vein was, now I am asking you Mr. McDouglas do you know what a purple vein is?"" The Principal had been waiting his whole life for a student like this he takes a deep breath clearly filled with frustration and says ""Son get out of this school! You are expelled. Do not ever try to come back!""

Suddenly the boy is walking home in tears over today's events so far. He gets home and see his mom is doing house chores. He wipes his tears and has the secure feeling of being in his home. She says ""You're home early, everything okay?"" The boy choked as he began to speak ""Well M-M-Mom I was walking to school today when three girls called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me, I talked to the teacher and asked her what a purple vein was, she sent me to the principal, I asked the principal he expelled me, mom do you know what a purple vein is?"" The mother with much disgust look as if she witnessed her son murdering their family pet. She said to the boy ""Go to your room! Do not come out till your father gets home, you hear me boy!"" The boy in tears again says ""Yes, Mother..""

After a few hours with what seemed like forever the father arrives home and the boy is nervously anticipating his father's future approach. Soon he hears him coming up the stairs in a not so relaxed pace, his father opens the door and yells ""What did you do to your mother!?"" The boy tears flowing down his face stuttered out ""Dad I was walking to school and these three girls called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me to the teacher, I asked the teacher what a purple vein was and she sent me to the principal, I then asked the principal what a purple vein was and he expelled me from the school, I got home and asked mom what a purple vein was and she sent me to my room, now dad do you know what a purple vein is?"" His dad with fever and disgust says ""Get out of my house and never come here again! You're not my son anymore!""

The boy had no place to go or knowledge of what to do. He saw a old hobo lady sitting on a bench in the park. He approached the woman and she seemed of warm spirit and cheered him up a bit before she starting asking why he was all by his lonesome. The boy replied "" Well I was walking to school when three girls approached me and called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me to the teacher, I asked the teacher what a purple vein was, she sent me to the principal, I asked him what a purple vein was and he expelled me, I got home and asked mom what a purple vein was and she told on me to my dad, who I asked what a purple vein was and he kicked me out of the house and family. Old hobo lady do you know what a purple vein is?"" The lady look at him and said ""No I do not, but do you see that castle across the street up the hill with the dark clouds and lightning? If you go there, there is a man who knows all and will have your answer.""

The boy is hopeful and almost crosses the street before getting hit by a bus.. Moral of the story, look both ways when you cross the road.",Purple Vein,8

He goes to the rental place and waits in line with everyone else looking to rent a limo for prom. He gets to the front and arranges everything, proud of himself because he didn't let the group down. Next he goes to rent a tux and finds that there's another line at this store. He waits while everyone else gets fitted and finally makes it to the front. He's worried that they may not have any left in his size but to his relief the store is prepared for prom season and Joe is able to get one in his size. Last on the list is a corsage for Ashley. He makes his way to the flower shop and encounters yet another line, which at this point he expected. He waits in line with everyone else and finally completes his to do list with a lovely corsage for his date.

Finally prom night is here and Joe more nervous and excited than he's ever been before. He gets to Ashley's house and she looks stunning. He gives her the corsage, her friends show up with their dates, everyone takes photos and they head to prom in the limo. Everything is going great and Joe is finally starting to relax. 

They arrive at prom and they spot a photobooth. Ashley and Joe get in line and  Joe starts to worry that Ashley might get bored. He's happy to see this line is moving more quickly than the one's he was in earlier and they have fun chatting while they wait. They get to the front and take their pictures. Ashley even gives Joe and kiss on the cheek in one of them.

post,cvjdt9,2qh72,jokes,false,1566794632,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cvjdt9/once_there_was_a_girl_named_darling/,self.jokes,,"... had a particularly rough childhood because of her uncommon name. She always got a lot of teasing and abuse at school and hated her parents for the pain they inflicted on her. By the time she graduated school, however, she overcame her anger and embraced her unusual name finding it brought her some fame as a competitive soccer player. 

Darling met and married a handsome veterinarian named Chorus who worked at an African wildlife reserve and, in time, they had a baby boy. Despite the hardships she endured, she demanded that the child also have a unique name but she didn’t want the boy to know it was her idea. She told the father that the boy’s name would be “Love” and that he had to pretend that it was his idea. He reluctantly agreed.

Darling’s soccer career flourished and Chorus became head of pachyderm health at the wildlife reserve. As Love grew, he endured the same ridicule and taunting that his mother did. Love’s father continued to cover for his wife's decision and argued that in time he would learn to appreciate his unique name. 

One day, Chorus was at work preparing a tranquilizer gun to work on an elephant when Love burst into his office. Love raged about the misery his name had caused him but Chorus kept up the pretense that the name was his own idea. Love grabbed the tranquilizer gun and shot his father with one of the potent darts before fleeing.

Chorus struggled for life aware that the elephant tranquilizer would kill him in a few short minutes. Darling, returning from a soccer practice found her husband struggling on the floor in his last moments of consciousness. Rushing to him, she held him in her arms and asked what happened? With his last labored breath


Chorus:

&gt; Shot with a dart and you’re to blame, Darling. 
&gt; 
&gt; You gave Love a bad name. 
&gt; 
&gt; I played my part while you played your game. 
&gt; 
&gt; You gave love a bad name.”",Once there was a girl named Darling...,188
