""It's a planet,"" replied God, ""and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."" 

""Balance?"" inquired Michael, still confused. 

God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth: ""For example, North America will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while South America is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot and Russia will be a cold spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people,"" God continued, pointing to different countries. ""This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.""

The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to two small land masses and said: ""What's that one?""

""Ah,"" said God. ""That's New Zealand, the most glorious place on Earth. There are beautiful lakes, rivers, streams and hills. The people from New Zealand are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hardworking and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.""

Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed: ""What about balance, God? You said there will be BALANCE!""

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Philly, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""
The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats. The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""
Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Philly, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""
The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Philly and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""
The two reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Philadelphia, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""
The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.
The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 guys from Philadelphia . He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering. The devil was dumbfounded. ""I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?""

He went to a room where he faced a huge titanium door, and after he went past it, there stood the metal door, then the steel door and finally the copper door. The copper was however locked and the loud bang stopped. The following day he asked the monks what was behind the copper door and they said they’d only reveal it if he became a monk. But he was young and didn’t want to waste his youth on being a monk so he passed and drove his repaired car down the mountain. 

Weeks and years passed and he aged along with time, and this time he drove back to the same mountain, car broke down at the same spot and went to the same temple to look for help. While he was asleep, he heard the same loud bangs on the gate/ door and same thing he went through the titanium door metal door steel door and copper door. The copper door is still locked and the next day he asked the monk again what’s behind the door, and the monk replied the same thing and this time he is ready to become a monk as he doesn’t have his youth anymore and why not. 

So in order to become a monk, he must complete 3 tasks. The first task was to count the number of grass on the field and months has passed and he finally completed it. The second task was to count the number of animals in country and months has passed before he finally counted all of them. The final task given was to count the number of sand and after years and years of counting he is finally ready and eligible to become a monk. 

The monk brought him to the gate and unlocked the door for the man, whom look VERY SURPRISED. 

You Want to know what’s behind the door?








You have to become a monk first :)","One day a young man drove his car to a steep mountain when all of a sudden his car broke down, and he had to head to the nearest temple to seek shelter.",0

A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier.

Because of their hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules together. So, the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife flying down the following day.

The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her email address, and without realizing his error, sent the e-mail.

Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston , a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a Baptist minister who was called home to glory following a heart attack.

The widow decided to check her e-mail expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.

The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:

To: My Loving Wife Subject: I've Arrived Date: August 14, 2017

I know you're surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send emails to your loved ones. I've just arrived and have been checked in.

The couple sat and waited for an answer... for a couple of months.

While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all? ""What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?""

Yet another month passed before St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.

""Yes,"" he informed the couple, ""You can get married in Heaven.""

""Great!"" said the couple. ""But we were just wondering; what if things don't workout? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?""

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard on the ground.

""What's wrong?"" asked the frightened couple.

A week later, the private school calls his father saying, ""Your son keeps acting up in class, and his behaviour is unacceptable. We'd reccomend placement in another school.""

Yet again, the father talks to the son and decides to send him to a Boarding School.

Another week passes, and the father gets yet another call; the same as the others. ""Your son keeps acting up in class, and his behaviour is unacceptable. We'd reccomend placement in another school.""

At this point, the father doesn't care anymore and decides to send his son to a Catholic school.

A few months pass, and the father hadn't received a single call about his sons behavior. Curious as to what has changed, the father asks, ""Hey Jacob, what changed? Why did you all of a sudden stop acting up?""

Jacob looks up from his dinner and responds, ""Well dad, when I walked in there and saw a man nailed to the cross; I knew they meant business.""",A Young Jewish boy kept acting up at school..,154

Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselves standing before the pearly gates of Heaven, where St. Peter and the Devil were standing nearby. ""Gentlemen,"" the Devil started, ""Due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St. Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell."" 


The philosopher then stepped up, ""OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings."" With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared.


The mathematician then asked, ""Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!"" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too. 


Then Dave stepped forward and said, ""Bring me a chair!"" The Devil brought forward a chair. ""Drill 7 holes on the seat."" The Devil did just that. Dave sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, ""Which hole did my fart come out from?"" The Devil inspected the seat and said,""The third hole from the right.""

His friend advised ‘Don’t do that. There is a computer at the drugstore that will diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Just put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what to do about it. It only costs $10.’

Joe figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with urine and deposited the $10.

The computer started making some noises and various lights started flashing.

After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:

YOU HAVE TENNIS ELBOW. SOAK YOUR ARM IN WARM WATER. AVOID HEAVY LABOR. IT
WILL BE BETTER IN TWO WEEKS.
Later that evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.

He decided to give it a try.

He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.
To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, poured in the sample in the machine and deposited $10.

The machine again made the usual noise and printed out the following analysis:

YOUR TAP WATER IS TOO HARD – GET A WATER SOFTENER.

YOUR DOG HAS WORMS – GIVE IT VITAMINS.

YOUR DAUGHTER IS USING COCAINE – PUT HER IN REHAB.

YOUR WIFE IS PREGNANT, TWINS, THEY ARE NOT YOURS – GET A LAWYER.

For those who don't get the joke, the redhead and brunette both mimic things that might be in an alleyway-a cat and a stray dog. The blonde however wonders ""What would be in a potato sack? Potatoes!"" and thus tries to blend in by announcing herself as a potato.

Edit Edit: I'm blond. I can make these jokes.","A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead rob a bank..",7

Curious to find out what the substance was, he opened the package and it erupted in a puff of powder. After inhaling half the cloud the Chemist felt vibrant, energised and happy. 

“I hast not seen ziss beefore”, thought the Chemist, as he read, “Cocaina (cocaine)“ written on the side of the package. 

Feeling pretty high, he decided to try and cut this glorious powder with some of the weird substances from his lab. He took the powdered dog bone off of the shelf and combined it with the Cocaine 50/50.

“Here goes nussing!” he said aloud, and snorted up a big hit. 

The Chemist woke up in a pool of his own dribble on the floor of his lab. Something felt different, he felt light, he felt floaty, he was FLOATING!

This new concoction had given him the power to float! “ZINCREDIBLE!!” The Chemist shouted.

“I vant more!” The Chemist immediately started blending another batch, this time Cocaine and crushed dried wart. He planted his face into the blended powders and sniffed as much as his nostrils could take. He passed out.

After waking this time, he felt different. He could see everything so clearly... Not just everything in front of him, but through the walls “Holy moly…. I hast X-ray vizion!” Thought the Chemist.

Over the course of the next month the Chemist experimented with various concoctions.

He documented his findings:

¼ Cocaine : ¾ crumbled ant – Accelerated hair growth for 50 minutes.

½ Cocaine : ½ bat excrement – Increased vertical jump by 3 metres.

½ Cocaine : ¼ extract of horse sperm : ¼ mouldy breadcrumbs – night vision for 2 hours.

¼ Cocaine : ¾ ground bear claw – Incredibly increased reaction speed for 15 minutes.

½ cocaine : ½ old mans dandruff – attractiveness to the opposite sex massively increased for 2 hours. (unfortunately wore off at critical moment). 

The Chemist had discovered more than 234 combinations, each giving him some kind of enhanced ability. 

“If cocaine can do ziss“, thought the Chemist, “imagine vaat would happen if I blended my uzzer narcotics with zees ingreedients.“

Desperate to find an even better combination, he raided his stash of mind altering substances.

First up, ½ MDMA to ½ Powdered mushroom. It was a DISASTER! The chemist was completely deaf! “Nein! Mein ears, mein ears!“ he cried, unable to hear his own voice. 

Panicked he quickly tried to concoct a different blend. ¼ Heroin to ¼ ground frogs eyes. The outcome was no better… He collapsed to the ground, “Mein legs! I cannot feel mein legs!”

Quickly he dragged himself over to the bench and blended ½ Pure THC with ½ elephant tusk. “Mein eyes! Mein  eyes, I cannot see!”

He had to try something quick… maybe there were some scraps of Cocaine left on the floor from his previous experiments. He scooped up as much of the powder from the floor as he could and immediately snorted it. 

Little did he know he’s just inhaled a combination of PCP, Methamphetamine powder, LSD, 20 year old dust, and spider droppings. He started to feel bad, really bad, deathly bad.

Suddenly he grabbed his stomach, bent forward and with an almighty gurgle his bowels completely collapsed. Shit came streaming out of his rear like never before… it wouldn’t stop, shit turned to mucus, mucus turn to blood. 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, he couldn’t stop. He felt his insides collapsing in on themselves as his intestines started sliding out. It wouldn’t stop, he felt his bones shudder and shake, they followed his intestines, flying out of his rear passage which was now a vast gaping hole.

“NeeEEEIIIiiiiinnNnnn!!!”

He felt his eyeballs tug out from the inside, through what remained of his body and pop out of his rectum, his teeth, his nose, his brain!

Dead… inside out and strewn across his lab floor in a bloody mess. 

To this day, it is said that if you don’t want to end up like the German Chemist, always remember….

If it ain’t Coke, don’t mix it.","In 1859, there was this German Chemist living in London, England.",5

He also invited Brian, the only aborigine in the neighbourhood.

He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns and oysters from the barbecue, and flirting.

Then at the height of the party, the millionaire said, ""I have a 15 foot man-eating crocodile in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who'll join him in the pool.""

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.

Everyone turned around and saw Brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, Brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.

An exhausted Brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.

The millionaire said, ""Well, Brian, I reckon I owe you a million dollars then.""

""Nah, you all right boss, I don't want it,"" said Brian.

So the millionaire said ""Man, I have to give you something. You won the bet. How about half a million bucks?""

""No thanks, I don't want it,"" Brian insisted.

The millionaire said, ""Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was amazing. How about a new Porsche, a Rolex and some stock options?""

Once again, Brian said, ""No.""

Terrified they went immediately to the doctors office. The doctor listened to the story and devised a plan. 

“I’m going to try to lure the bee out with honey. I’ll put some on the tip of a small probe and insert it just past the lips of her vagina and see if the bee can be drawn out.” 

They try this for over an hour and no bee. The doctor thinks on the some more and decides that the amount of honey is not sufficient and the opening must be wide enough for the bee to fly out. So the doctor devised a second plan. 

“This time I’m going to put a large amount of honey on the tip of my penis and insert it into the vagina to achieve deeper penetration and make the exit hole wider by the width of my shaft.”

Initially the husband was horrified and suggested that if this was the plan that he should be the one to do it. However the doctor was prepared for this response and quietly dropped his pants to reveal a large and thick cock that nearly doubled the size of the husband. The husband then reluctantly agreed. 

After applying a large amount of honey the doctor slowly eased his cock into the woman. He first pushed it as far back as he could and the wife began to moan slightly. Noticing that she was a very beautiful woman, and not feeling any evidence of a bee the doctor decided to do a few deep thrusts to see if he could move the bee from his hiding place. 

Noticing what was happening and seeing that his wife was being pleasured by the doctor, who was also enjoying himself, he became offended and began shouting at the doctor to stop immediately. The doctor, now very much into the procedure looks at the husband and says, “Change of plans, sir, I’m gonna drown the little bastard.”",A husband and his wife were about to make love.

As he’s driving his Porsche, he spots a rather deep hole in the road. While driving around it, he hears a cry for help. “Is anyone there? Please help me get out of here!” Upon further inspection, he sees this poor, helpless elephant.

He wants to help him, but he is just a mouse, and he says this. A few minutes, maybe even seconds later, he remembers he has rope in the trunk of his car, lots of it. Wasting no time, he begins tying it to his car, and saves this elephant. The elephant thanks him, and tells him he owes him his life.

Despite being a little late, the date goes well, maybe too well. The mouse admittedly was a little tipsy, and he had forgotten about the hole. This mistake leads to an even bigger one, and he finds himself at the bottom with nothing but himself, and his now wrecked Porsche.

The next day, the elephant finds the mouse in his own previous predicament. The mouse cries out in a very similar manner, and the elephant says: “I owe you my life, but I don’t know how I can get you out. I don’t have any rope...” He pauses briefly for a solution had come to mind. “Wait I got it!” He exclaims. “I can use my dick!” So, the mouse swallows his pride, and latches onto the elephants dick, and moments later he reaches the surface.

The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for.

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.'

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years.'

Joe tried the shirt and it fitted perfectly.

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?'

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..'

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36.

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..'

So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."".

""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.

That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".

""Okay."" replies the dog, ""You have nine hundred sheep.""",A farmer has 895 sheep.,112

The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.

The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explained the trial to him. ""You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten.""

The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.

The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.

The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, ""Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?"" The second one replied, ""I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples.""",Cannibal fruit,113

As quick as they could, they set out to track down the best clue to the location of the Holy Grail. It was a long hard ride, across fens and through forests.

One night, while they camped beside a peat bog, it was Sir Lancelot that noticed that his King had gone missing! He roused the other knights, dispatching Gawain to the north, Percival to the south, Galahad to the West, and himself to the East. They searched for hours, for days, and it was a week later that they found King Arthur- in quite a sorry state.

Their King was naked, drunk, and sprawled across a low stone table in a small copse of trees. Ashamed, he desperately tried to explain: ""You'll never believe it! I rose from my bedroll to answer the call of nature when I was abducted by a screaming band of warriors, their hair like flame and faces painted blue. They dragged me out into the woods to use me as part of one of their pagan rituals. I must confess,"" he said, humblebragging, ""there were many, *many* beautiful women, and the ritual did involve me and each one of them… well, you *know*.""

After weeks of frustration, he finally breaks down and and goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him a thorough examination and finally makes the diagnosis.

""Well, there's good news and there's bad news,"" she says. ""The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure.""

The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. ""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says: ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it.""

So the doctor performs the operation. A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches the point of being painful. Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his stunned girlfriend, ""That was impressive! Can you do that again?""

Eyes watering and face flushed, he says, ""Probably ... but I don't know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass!""",There was a guy,32

They are brought to the village where the village elder asks the first one. 
""Dea-th or Ka-bo-chi?"" 
Fearing the worst, the first archeologist chooses Ka-bo-chi.

The other two in horror, hope he's made the right choice.
They then see the tribesmen pull out a metal rod from the hot charcoal and shove it up the archaeologist's arse. 
The tribe shouts ""Ka-bo-chi..Ka-bo-chi..Ka-bo-chi..""

The elder approaches second archeologist and now asks him 
""Dea-th or Ka-bo-chi?"" 
Seeing his friend in agonising pain but alive, the second one clenches his cheeks and chooses Ka-bo-chi. 
He gets one up his as well and the tribe bursts out into ""Ka-bo-chi..Ka-bo-chi..Ka-bo-chi..""

The third one having some time to think and having studied a bit of linguistics suspects that 'dea-th might not be death' in the tribal language and may have an alternate meaning. The elder might be asking something akin to ""innocent or guilty"".

The elder now approaches and asks him. 
""Dea-th or Ka-bo-chi?"" 
Having put some thought into it and unable to fathom the thought of Ka-bo-chi upon him, he replies
""Dea-th""
After an eerie silence the elder proclaims
""Give dis one Ka-bo-chi till he dies...""

They raise the blade of the guillotine and release it. It comes speeding down and suddenly stops just inches from his neck. The authorities take this as divine intervention and release the priest.

Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.  

The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""

Convince he was going to prove the power of his scooter he invited both of them to hop on and go for a ride. Seemingly unimpressed Joe and Harry agreed while still laughing. 



They drive off – Sam immediately drives into the main road at a semi-fast speed hoping to scare his friends while also trying to impressing them. He turns sharply left then right as he swerves around other vehicle but this is only greeted with “hahahah” from his friends riding behind him. Mad about what he is hearing he throttles his poor scoter to its limit achieving the highest speed possible…serving even more aggressively and dangerously. Still, all he hears is “Hahahahaha”.

Since he was a Chief in a modern society he had never been taught he old secrets.

When he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later he called the National Weather Service again. ""Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's going to be a very cold winter.""

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later the Chief called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ""We're sure it's going to be cold because the Indians are collecting firewood like crazy!"" ",It's going to be a cold winter,190

No such luck. Barely a good morning, let alone a “Happy birthday”.
I figured…well, that’s marriage for you. Maybe the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn’t say a word.

Needless to say, I left for the office feeling pretty low and despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Martha said, “Good morning boss! Happy birthday!”. 

At least someone remembered.

Around one o’clock, Martha knocked on my door and said, “You know. It’s such a beautiful day outside and it’s your birthday. Let’s go out to lunch, just you and me”.

Best thing I’d heard all day.

We went and had lunch in a little place with a private table. Two martinis each, leg of lamb and amazing conversation.

On our way back to the office, Martha quipped, “You know, it’s such a beautiful day…we don’t need to go back to the office, do we?”

“I guess not” I replied. “What do you have in mind?”

She smiled. “Let’s go to my apartment.”

When we got to her apartment, Martha turned to me and said, “I’m going to step into the bedroom to freshen a bit, boss. I’ll be right back.”

I nodded nervously.

She went into the bedroom, and after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake and singing “Happy Birthday” followed by my wife, my kids, a dozen of my friends and co-workers.

post,7urlk4,2qh72,jokes,false,1517581298,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7urlk4/mountain_man/,self.jokes,,"Well Tom was a high powered business man and successful stock market trader, but he sure was fed up with life in the fast lane of New York City. Fed up with the hustle and the bustle. Fed up with the fickle market. But one night, sipping scotch, he realized that the root of all his problems was PEOPLE.  

And being a man of action, Tom went into work the next day, quit his job, and headed out west to find solitude.  A place where no one would ever bother him.  He bought an abandoned cabin in the wilds of Montana with no people as far as the eye could see.

The first morning, he was outside working hard--repairing a fence, digging out his garden.  It was hard work, but it felt good.  Just then, in the distance, he saw a sight that made his heart sink: a rusty old pickup truck driving right toward him!

As it pulled up, a big old grizzly mountain man hopped out with a shout of ""Hi ho neighbor! I live on the other side of that there mountain, and I wanna welcome you to the neighborhood!  In fact, you've got great timing, because I'm throwing a neighborhood block party this Friday, and you would be MOST welcome!"" 

Tom stopped him in his tracks: ""I'm sorry, sir, but I moved here to get AWAY from...""  

The mountain man interrupted: ""But before you say yes, I gotta warn ya...there's going to be some DRINKIN'.""

Tom was quick to answer: ""Well sir, I assure you I can handle my alcohol, but I still have to say...""

But the mountain man interrupted again: ""OH, and I gotta warn ya...there's gonna be some FIGHTIN'.""

Tom once again answered dutifully: ""Well sir, I come from New York City, lived right off of 42nd Street and I've seen my share of rough behavior, and nothing really compares with having to stare down aggressive business folks trying to screw you out of every penny, but I still have to say n-...""

One last time the mountain man interrupted: ""I understand that sir, you must be one tough fella, but before you say yes, I gotta warn ya... there's gonna be some SEX.""

At this, Tom had had enough, and truthfully, his curiosity was piqued. ""Sir, I've seen things in New York City you've only dreamed of, I'm sure I can handle this backwoods block party. And I'd be happy to come to your party, I suppose it's the neighborly thing to do.""

The mountain man was delighted. He hopped back in the pickup truck with a jump in his surprisingly spry legs, and started to drive off.  But Tom quickly flagged him down: ""Sir, one thing--I don't know much about this neighborhood--what should I wear, is it going to dress up, or casual, or...""

The mountain man looked puzzled.  As he drove off, he shouted, ""Suit yourself! It's just gonna be you and me!""",Mountain Man,113

They were out for days with no luck, but one day Towards snagged a HUGE fish. They fought for hours until the fish dragged Towards overboard, never to be seen again. Sad and tired, Away and their father set home, but realized they were lost. The navigated the ocean, fishing for food and hoping to find home one day. One day, Away was fishing when he snagged a fish 5 times bigger than the one that got Towards. They fought for days until the fish gave one final tug, pulling Away to his death. The man is miserable, but realizes he can see land. He steers his boat towards it and realizes he can see his house! He looks again and he sees his wife on their back porch.

After a long pause he says “Ok, I will humour you, follow me up to the top of the bell tower”. Once reaching the top of the tower, the priest turned to the boy and motioned him to ring the bell. The boy responded by taking a few steps backwards, and then sprinting at the bell, smashing his face directly into it. At first the priest was shocked, but the most beautiful sound he ever heard rung from the bell, and soothed him momentarily. He turned to the boy, still a little stunned, and asked “Are you alright my child? I do not want you to hurt yourself.” The boy replied with “Oh I am perfectly fine father, do not worry for me. See! Watch me ring the bell again.” And without hesitation he took a few steps backwards, and ran directly into the bell a second time, again hitting it with his face. A second ring sounded from the bell, sweeping across the town, even more beautiful than the first one. As the priest helped the boy to his feet he told him “I have been the minister for this church for over fifty five years, and in all my time here I have never heard such a beautiful sound. I would be honoured if you could ring the bell for Sunday mass”. And with that they departed until then. Come Sunday morning, the boy climbed to the top of the tower, took a few steps back, and ran at the bell. But this time, he tripped over a thick piece of rope on the floor, and tumbled over the side of the tower, falling to his death. Upon finding him, the people of the town tried to find out what his name was in order to inform his family what happened, when they noticed he look strangely familiar. He had no identification on him so the people began to ask whoever was around “Do you know the name of this boy? He looks quite familiar, did he go to school with your children?” But nobody knew who the boy was. Finally, the priest came out of the church, and he was instantly asked “Father! Father! Surely you must know the name of this boy!” The priest responded with “I’m sorry I do not, but his face sure did ring a bell”.",This is the story of the armless bell ringer,1

So the man has a merry old time, he rubs his head - gorilla does it too! He thumbs his nose - so does the ‘rilla. ... this goes on for a while, until the man shoves his finger up his nostril. 

The gorilla just goes berserk!! 

The ‘rilla just stands up, roars!! Beats on his chest! (Kinda like Kim Kardashian when she sees shiny stuff). 

Then the ‘rilla just bends the bars of the cage... and gets out!! And beats the living day lights outta the man!!

The man is in shock and pain!! He cant understand why the gorilla would do that!!

The zookeeper appears ... and explains - shoving a finger up the nose means “Fuck you!” In gorilla sign language!

The man is really pissed and leaves. That evening as he recovers, he plots his revenge.

The next day, he buys 2 baseball caps, 2 newspapers, 2 knives and 1 sausage. And heads to the zoo again.

He goes back to the gorilla exhibit. And the big ‘rilla is there again, sitting peacefully. The cage has been fixed. Everything is calm.

He throws one of each - baseball cap, newspaper and knife in to the cage.

Then he gets the gorilla’s attention, and places the baseball cap he has, on his head. The ‘rilla mimics him. Then the guy takes it off and throws it off! So does the ‘rilla!

The the man picks up the newspaper, pretends to read it. So does the ‘rilla! Then he crumples it and throws it off! Again the ‘rilla mimics!

Now the man grabs the knife and starts playing with it. So does the gorilla!

Then the man, who had previously hidden the sausage in his pants, opens his fly, takes the sausage out - and cuts it with one sharp slash of the knife and throws it away!
