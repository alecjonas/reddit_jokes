The sergeant tells his troops: ""Well, I know the climate is harsh and that you won't have a lot of entertainment here as there is no women. But, in case you cannot stand the pressure anymore, you will be allowed to take the camel behind this tent."" and ends his speech with a wink.
While passing by, Tom the soldier takes a look at the camel. It's old, foul, leaks fur, its rear is covered with dry poo and flies are buzzing all around.


2 months pass, and Tom the soldier sees some of his comrades going behind the tent. When they come back, they display a large smile and swag.


After 4 months, Tom is still observing his brothers in arms doing the same little game. But he thinks ""Are they really that sexually deprived?"" as he can smell the old camel's awful scent from his place. He then reflects to find an alternative.


Another month passes and Tom continues to look at happy men coming back from behind the tent. As he feels tension from the waist down, he tells himself ""I won't do such a thing. I can resist.""


Another month passes and Tom is now having a hard time, obsessed with his own nuts. But the remembrance of the camel's aspect keeps him from acting.


After the 7th month, he feels real pain. He gets up and says: ""I can't handle it anymore. This is beyond my limits.""

Tom drinks alcohol, goes behind the tent and looks at the camel with some revulsion : ""I'm sorry. I have to. Blurg.""

Soon after unzipping his trousers, the whole camp begins to hear loud growls and rumbles-chewbacca style ""HHRRAAAWW HHHRROOOON HRON HHHRAAAWAAAR HRRAAWWAR""

Everyone then hastens to check what is happening. They find Tom, naked behind the camel.

Sergeant asks: ""WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING, SOLDIER ??""

Tom faintly answers: ""But... you said that the camel was here to release the pressure, so I thought...""

Sergeant replies: ""GRMBL! The camel is only here to get your ass to the next village, you jerk.""",Tom the soldier in the desert.,10

Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store.  Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.  After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:  You have tennis elbow.  Soak your arm in warm water.  Avoid heavy lifting.  It will be better in two weeks."" Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.  He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.  He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: ""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.  Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.  They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

As part of the negotiations, the British Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5- year phase-in plan that would become known as ""Euro-English"". 

In the first year, ""s"" will replace the soft ""c"". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard ""c"" will be dropped in favour of ""k"". This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter. 

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. 

Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. 

Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent ""e"" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away. 

By the 4th yer people wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing ""th"" with ""z"" and ""w"" with ""v"". 

During ze fifz yer, ze unesesary ""o"" kan be dropd from vords kontaining ""ou"" and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensi bl riten styl.

He visited churches in Seattle, Boise, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, New York, Denver, and on around the United States and found more phones with the same sign, and the same answer from each pastor.


Finally, he arrived in Texas. Upon entering a church, lo and behold, he saw the usual golden telephone But THIS time the sign read ‘Calls: 25 cents.’ Fascinated, he asked to talk to the pastor.
‘Reverend, I have been in cities all across the country and in each church I found this golden telephone, and I have been told it is a direct line to Heaven and that I could talk to God, but in the other churches the cost was $10,000 a minute. Your sign reads 25 cents a call. Why?

Since they recognised that this was a dangerous journey, they decided to ask their final three candidates, an Indian, a Malay and a Chinese man, how much of a bonus would they need to give them to accept the mission.

They called the Indian man in first, and then asked him how much of a bonus he wanted to join the program. ""One thousand dollars!"" he declared. When they pressed him for why, the Indian replied that he had a large family to feed, with eleven children, and the money would be needed to care for them.

Next, they called in the Malay man and asked him the same question. ""Two thousand dollars!"" was the response. When they asked him why, the Malay replied that he had just started a business, and he needed the money for the business to survive without him.

Finally, they called in the Chinese man. When the question was asked, the Chinese man thought for a while, then said ""Eleven Thousand.""

""Eleven Thousand?!?"" the interviewer asked, surprised. ""Why so much?""

The Chinese man leant in close, and whispered:

""Five thousand for you, five thousand for me, and one thousand to send the Indian into space.""",The Malaysian Space Program,57

So they track down the landmine marker out in the desert. They ask him what it's like to have the worst job. He says ""This job isn't the worst - at my last job I had to dive in the sewer fixing pipes and looking for lost objects that would clog the system. I thought I'd be stuck there forever until last week when this guy begged me for the job.""

So they head underground and find the sewer diver and ask him what it feels like to have the worst job in the world.

""Man, this job is a thousand times better than my last job. I got out of there so fast, I took the first job I could find!"" 

The producer looks at him, and says ""You can't be serious! What job could be worse than road kill collector, landmine marker or sewer diver?""

Suddenly, he gazes upon the most beautiful bronze statue of a siamese cat. He asks the store owner how much he wants for the statue. The store owner replies ""It's $100 for the statue and $1000 for the story that goes with it."" The man replies ""I really don't care about the story, but I do want the statue. As the man is paying for the statue, the shop owner says ""All right, but I guarantee you will be back for the story.""

The man walks out of the shop and starts down the street carrying the cat statue. When he comes to the crosswalk, he happens to glance behind him and sees 3 or 4 cats sitting about 10 feet away, looking at him. He shrugs it off and crosses when the light changes. He goes several more blocks and, at another crosswalk, looks behind himself again. This time there are about 30 cats sitting there looking at him. The man starts to get a little nervous and picks up his pace when the light changes.

By the time the man reaches the pier at the end of the street, he has now been running for several blocks. He was running because every time he turned around, there were more and more cats behind him. He looked like the pied piper. When he got to the end of the pier, he turned around once more and saw at least 10,000 cats sitting there looking at him. There were so many cats that there was no way to get off the pier without going through them and he knew there was no way he was going to do that. In a panic, he turned toward the water and heaved the statue as far as he could. Amazingly, all of the cats ran right past him and jumped in the water after the statue and drowned.

The man, still shaking from his ordeal, immediately started running back to the shop.

The young gun draws quickly and shoots out the candle on the left hand side. The bar goes silent, but the pianist keeps on playing. So the cowboy draws again and shoots out the right hand candle. There are gasps from the bar, but the pianist keeps playing. So the cowboy draws and shoots the hat off the pianist ... but he just keeps on playing.

""sure""

""Firstly, I notice you shoot from the hip. You should file down the sight on your gun, 'cause you don't need it and one day it will catch on your holster and get you in trouble""

""Secondly, get rid of the trigger guard, cause if you're in a fight, you need to shoot as quickly as possible and one day that might just mean the difference between life and death""

He leaned his head back and slammed it into the bell. The ringing of the bell was loud and true, the pastor was pleased to hear. ""Sir that is amazing, but we have to ring the bell each hour a number of times equal to the number of the hour, I couldn't ask you to...""

Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself.

&gt;Kindly check attached photos. When the mason jar is empty, the weight is 460g and when fill up with water, weight is 1106g So the capacity of the big mason jar is around 23oz. We only have two size mason jars, so when you mention 24oz, we thought it's one because the capacity is very similar. Pls check with customer whether this the mason jar is ok.

Dear factory,

I am not sure what you are saying. 24 ounces is a Capacity, Not Weight. The large Mason jars samples you sent hold 20 ounces of Liquid. Not 24. ounces. I measured the capacity myself. We need to increase the capacity . Make it 24 ounces. I need you to confirm with an Engineer that the Cost will be the same for a 24 oz. size as you quoted to us. This customer has 10,000 stores, there cannot be any mistakes. Otherwise you have wasted everyone's time. I need an answer today,

&gt;Dear merchant,

&gt;I also measure the capacity myself. When empty, weight is 460g, when fill up with water, weight is 1106g. So capacity is (1106-460)/28.5=22.67 ounces Pls make sure when you measure the capacity, the mason jar is fill up.

&gt;Is your customer very strict on the capacity and can not accept 1oz difference? If so, we can make the mason jar a little bigger but need to open new mold and the cost will add around 0.03

To that, Pete's regular replies, ""No. No no no, no. I have something that will cheer you up. I promise. You see, there's a window on the top floor of this building with magical properties.""  
  
""Bull shit,"" the newcomer says.  
  
Pete is sipping on a seltzer water, listening on.  
  
""I'm serious. I'll prove it. Once you use this window, you'll never worry about that ol' ball and chain again. You'll be free! Hey man, you got nothing to lose, just follow me real quick and I'll show you.  
  
""Well, alright."" And they walk upstairs.  
  
Pete is still sitting, daydreaming, sipping his seltzer--meanwhile, the regular and the newcomer are exchanging words upstairs.  
  
""So, all you gotta do is dive out of this window head first, and you'll be granted the gift of flight. And who needs booze when you can *fly*!""  
  
""You think I'm an idiot?"" The newcomer continues, ""Buzz off, I'll buy myself a bottle at the gas station and drink at home. I'm sick of everyone, damn it!""  
  
""Not so fast,"" the regular says. ""Let me show you.""  
  
The newcomer eyes him, tired, and makes his way towards the stairs when--just then--the regular dives head first out the window. The newcomer shouts, ""NO! WAIT!"" and sprints back towards the window, hoping foolishly that he will be able to save Pete's favorite customer. Then, suddenly...  
  
The newcomer gazes in astonishment as the regular falls within feet of the pavement, then rockets back into the sky and pulls a double loop-de-loop. He is floating in the air when he calls to Pete's newcomer, ""See? What did I tell ya! Come on out and be free my new pal!""  
  
With a rush of excitement and new-found will to live, the newcomer jumps headlong out of the window...  
  
Back behind the bar, Pete hears the newcomer's faint scream, then a loud *THUD* outside the front door. Then, his regular comes through the door, straightening his tie and chuckling.  
  
Pete says, ""Superman, you're an asshole.""",Newcomer at Pete's Pub,1

As he’s walking he sees a young man tossing up in the air and catching what appears to be a small bottle of water. As the Priest approaches the young man, he can’t help but notice ‘HCL’ embossed on the vial. The Priest thinks that the young man may inadvertently harm himself with the Hydrochloric Acid in the vial.

He decides to act. “Young man,” he says, “That’s a mighty fancy bottle of liquid you have there.”

“Yeah Father”, he says, “This is some mighty powerful shit.”
“Ahem”, says the Priest. “Young man”, he says, “I really like it.” He says. “How about we consider a trade?”
‘Oh yeh father, what to have to offer?”

The Priest pulls out a vial of Holy Water for beneath his robe and asks, “How about I trade you for this?”The young man looks at the bottle of Holy Water and asks, “What’s so powerful about this?”
The Priest says, ”If I were to rub this on the belly of a pregnant woman, she would pass a baby!”

The kid says, “That sounds pretty powerful alright, but that’s NOTHING!” He exclaims, “If I dab a spot of this on a cat’s ass, that sumbitch will pass a bus!!

Once upon a time there was a king who wanted to go fishing. 
 He called the royal weather forecaster and inquired as to the weather 
 forecast for the next few hours. The weatherman assured him that there was 
 no chance of rain in the coming days. 

 So the king went fishing with his wife, the queen. 

 On the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer 
 said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just 
 a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area"". 

 The king was polite and considerate, he replied: ""I hold the palace 
 meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced 
 professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different 
 forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" So they did. 

 However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King 
 and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them 
 in such a shameful condition. 

 Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the 
 weatherman at once! 

 Then he summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying 
 role of royal forecaster. 

 The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I 
 obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping, 
 it means with certainty that it will rain."" 

 So instead, the King hired the donkey. And thus began the practice of 
 hiring asses to work in the government and occupy its highest and most 
 influential positions.

So next Sunday he took the bishop's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

He was a widower and she a widow. They had known each other for a number of years being high school classmates and having attended class reunions in the past without fail. This 60th anniversary of their class, they had a wonderful evening, their spirits high.The widower throwing admiring glances across the table. The widow smiling coyly back at him.

Finally, he picked up courage to ask her, “Will you marry me?”

After about six seconds of careful consideration, she answered, “Yes,….. yes I will!”

The evening ended on a happy note for the widower. But the next morning he was troubled. Did she say “Yes” or did she say “No?”

He couldn’t remember. Try as he would, he just could not recall. He went over the conversation of the previous evening, but his mind was blank. He remembered asking the question but for the life of him he could not recall her response. With fear and trepidation he picked up the phone and called her.

First, he explained that he couldn’t remember as well as he used to. Then he reviewed the past evening.

As he gained a little more courage he then inquired of her. “When I asked if you would marry me, did you say “Yes” or did you say “No?”

“Why you silly man, I said ‘Yes. Yes I will.’ And I meant it with all my heart.”

The widower was delighted. He felt his heart skip a beat.

Then she continued. “And I am so glad you called because I couldn’t remember who asked me!” :P :P ",Do you remember me ? Sometimes memory loss isn't that uncommon !,2

forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" So they did.

However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King
and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them
in such a shameful condition.

Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the
weatherman at once!

Then he summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying
role of royal forecaster.

The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I
obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping,
it means with certainty that it will rain.""

So instead, the King hired the donkey. And thus began the practice of
hiring asses to occupy the highest and most
influential government positions.",The King's Wisdom,0

When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""","During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans",2

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it’s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren’t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

..and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","So there’s a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides...",513

You see, his shoes got bored going from his local to his flat. They wanted to see the world, you know. He had a hell of a job getting rid of them. No matter who he sold them to, they'd show up again the next day. He tried to shut them out, but they just kicked the door down. 

The last thing I heard, they sort of... robbed a car and drove it into a canal. They couldn't steer, you see..Petersen was really, really blown away about it. He went to see a priest. The priest told him... he said it was alright and all that, when shoes are happy that they'd get into heaven.
