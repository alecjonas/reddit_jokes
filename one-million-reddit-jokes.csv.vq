rackshot. Her dad was a bit of a gun nut. Owned lots of rifles including a classic, old-time sniper from back in the WWII era. Beautiful old thing. She learned to fire it at age 12, could hit targets at 100 meters by age 15. She ended up entering some sharpshooting competition around the area. This one competition was particularly important to her because it was sponsored by a soda company. The prize was a year’s supply of any soda the winner wanted. Of course, my friend entered for that delicious lemon-lime goodness. So she hefted her trusty old sniper over to the field. There were 16 contestants so the competition was a single-elimination bracket. The rules were simple. Stand behind the line, aim and fire. If you hit it, the target got pushed back a few meters. If you miss and the other guy hits it, you’re out. Well my friend easily blew most of the competitors out of the water. Punks couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn. She completely cleared out her side of the bracket with almost no competition. It came down to the final round. She was up against Jackson. At 6 foot 6, this guy was an intimidating foe. Even with those catcher’s glove-sized hands he still wielded his rifle with the grace of a ballerina. Completely wiped out his side of the bracket. It was getting tense. He fired off first. 50 meters. Easy. Her next. 50 meters. Easy. And then him. 100 meters. Easy. Her. 100 meters. Easy. 150. Harder. 200. Harder. 300. Barely made it. But it came down to the wire. Two bottles, 400 meters down the field. Jackson stepped up first, sweat dripping down his face. He fired. BANG. CRACK. The bullet nicked the side, shattering the target. But you could see the Jackson’s nervousness. It was clear that he would not be able to hit the next target. It was up to Sierra now. She was sweating buckets. It all came down to this. If she could tap that glass even slightly, she’d be looking at a year’s supply of her favorite soft drink. She lined up her shot. Stared down the sights. The audience looked on in anticipation. Her lemon-lime drinks were on the line. This was all she needed. BANG. . . . Nothing. Her soda was gone. Sierra missed.",A girl and her sniper rifle.,0

So, Irelands illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a 'Tragedy' .

A little boy stood up and offered: 
'If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy.'

'Incorrect,' said Kenny 'That would be an accident.'

A little girl raised her hand: 'If a school bus carrying fifty children drove over a cliff, killing everybody inside, that would be a tragedy.'

'I'm afraid not', explained Kenny 'that's what we would refer to as a great loss'.

The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Mr Kenny searched the room.

'Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?'

Finally, at the back of the room, little Johnny raised his hand and said: If a plane carrying you,and Joan Burton was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile &amp; blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.'

'Fantastic' exclaimed Kenny , 'and can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?'

In the city of Quebec, there a cigar store. The owner is going on vacation.

To keep his business running he asks his friend to take over while he's away. The thing is, his friend doesn't speak a word of French while most people in the city don't speak a word of English.

The owner tells him not to worry as customers always ask the same three questions, all he has to do is memorize the answers and all will be well.

He tells his friend: The first question is usualy about what you're selling here so just answer:

**""Yes, we sell cigars!""**

The second question is about if the cigars are good. It varies with the cigars so you can answer:

**""Some are, some aren't...""**

By the third question they might get a bit uncertain as to buying so you can always tell them that **""Well, If you don't do it today, someone else will tomorrow"".**

The owner's trick worked well enough and his friend was able to run the store without any issue, until the 6th day when an exhausted customer came an hour before closing.

""Hey there, I've had a bad day and I want a cigar for tonight.""

**""Yes, we sell cigars!""**

""What? Do you take me for an idiot or something?""

And whose given name was 'Onestone'.

He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.

After years and years of torment,

Onestone finally cracked and said,'

If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'

The word got around and nobody called him that any more.

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said,

'Good morning, Onestone..'

He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day andall night.

He made love to her all the next day,

Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until

A woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away. Yellow Bird , who was BlueBird's cousin,

Was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.

She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,

Then he made love to her all day,

Made love to her all night,

Made love to her all the next day,

Made love to her all the next night, but YellowBird wouldn't die!

post,3ey0do,2qh72,jokes,false,1438116183,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3ey0do/it_was_caesars_birthday/,self.jokes,,"It was Caesar's birthday, and as in every year around this time, the Consuls were worrying about what to get him as a present. Brutus in particular was in a bind. How about a villa in the Apennines? He already had six. A Quinquireme? Marcus Antonius bought him a fleet of those last year, the suckup. He went to his wife for advice.

 ""O Portia, cousin and wife, avail me of your wisdom. What can I procure for our Dictator that will secure his good will and adequately celebrate the anniversary of his birth?""

 Portia considered this for a moment, idly toying with a freshly greased ringlet. ""We just got the new Far Samarkand Silk Road Mail Order Catalog. Why don't you go sit in your, uh, thinking room and have a look? Even if there's nothing in there, it might inspire you."" So, Brutus did just that. He settled onto the finely carved marble and hefted the Far Samarkand Silk Road Mail Order Catalog onto his lap, and began to page through.

 At first, he was dismayed at page after page of Apennine villas and fleets of Quinquiremes. He skipped over the heavily illustrated lingerie section, idly turning down the corners on a couple of pages for later reference - and then he saw it.

 Chocolate-Covered Christians.

 ""Each individually-crafted, guaranteed unique Chocolate-Covered Christian is shipped to you direct, on ice, and escorted by a platoon of Khwarezmian Eunuch Warrior Monks. Packed in straw and wicker and cradled in a specially-engineered howdah, the Chocolate-Covered Christian is carried by a camel trained from birth for this task*.

 ""*Ice, Warrior Monks, Packaging and Camel costs vary by shipping destination. Quantities are strictly limited, order now!""

 He was dumbstruck. This was... perfect. A glance at the fine print confirmed his suspicion, he had just enough time to order a couple of these bad boys before the big celebration, Two would be a fitting gift for Caesar, what the heck, he thought.

 So, in due course, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger went to the Appian Gate to take delivery. Sure enough, from far off in the distance he could see the dust cloud raised by his approaching delivery. As they drew closer, he could make out bright silk banners fluttering and the sound of Cornu and Auskales accompanying the strangely high-pitched singing of the escort. As they drew even closer, he could see the man-shaped wicker caskets standing atop the exotic beasts, swaying slightly back and forth, and steaming as the icy packaging sublimed in the midday sun.

 ""Awesome,"" thought Brutus, ""I am sorted. I'll pack these away in my icehouse until the big day. And the other crap beats any fancy wrapping paper.""

 So, a few days passed. But, as Brutus went about his daily consular duties, some of his colleagues might have noticed that his mind was not on his task. He seemed somehow... distant. Only Brutus knew the truth, as he was constantly wondering... what do they taste like? As time went on, he was seized by doubt, what if they're just plain bad? I really need to check. 

 So, came the night, and Brutus stole away into his icehouse. The Chocolate-Covered Christians stood in the darkness like a pair of mute witnesses to his shame, as he reached out... and snapped off a pinky finger. Breathlessly, he raised it to his lips, and bit.

 *It was delicious.*

 He could not control himself. This was the most delicious thing he had ever eaten. He reached out again, and snapped off the whole hand at the wrist. He devoured it in seconds, and reached out for more. 

 By dawn, Brutus sat in shame, head in hands. Next to him, one of the Chocolate-Covered Christians was half gone, just a pair of legs standing like accusing sentinels. His head cleared slightly as he realized that there was still, mercifully, one entirely untouched Chocolate-Covered Christian to serve as his gift. Also, he still had both camels, much of the ice, and nearly all of the Eunuchs... Things weren't too bad. He breathed a sigh of genuine relief, and smiled inwardly in the knowledge that still, Caesar would never have received such a gift as this.

 So, the day of Caesar's celebration arrived. This year, the Consuls had pretty much outdone themselves - Publius had flooded the Plain of Mars and staged a naval battle. Crassus had given a fleet of Septiremes, with the extra two rows of oars manned by slaves selected for their resemblance to Marcus Antonius. Marcus Antonius himself had presented a bevy of a thousand barely-clad maidens, one from each distant province and kingdom of the known world. And now it was Brutus' turn. He mounted the steps of the Theater of Pompey to stand next to his Dictator and, he hoped, friend.

 ""Now, Caesar, let me present... Your Chocolate-Covered Christian."". He raised an arm, and into the plaza moved the procession. The banners, trumpets, bells, drums and song were every bit as exotic as he had hoped. The panoply of the Eunuch Warriors and the camels were almost terrifying in their strangeness. And in the center, the swaying, faintly sinister Chocolate-Covered Christian itself, steaming slightly as the humid air chilled in its ice-cooled proximity. With pride, Brutus turned back to Caesar...

 ...In time to see Gaius Servilius Casca, standing behind Caesar, his arms raised, clutching a vicious looking knife in his hand. Brutus opened his mouth to cry out, but his shock was such that he was paralyzed into inaction. He was unable to stop the blow, and unable to act as others en the crowded steps moved forward, revealing formerly concealed knives, and rained down blows on Caesar.

 As they moved away to reveal the bloody figure on the ground, Brutus finally moved. He ran forwards and cradled the gory head of his dying friend. Still in shock, he leaned closer as he saw that Caesar was trying to speak. In his dying croak, he heard:

 ""Et tu, Brute?""

 Brutus said, ""No! I only had half of one!""",It was Caesar's birthday.,2

I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution, in order to escape a possible conflict with her.

She didn't seem pissed off in the least.

Whew, I got away with that one! Then she said 'We need a new cuckoo clock.'

No?  It was pretty interesting.  So, check it out, this group of missionaries was working in a rural part of some country in Asia, Thailand I think, and they found this baby that had been born with a congenital birth defect, he was born without eyelids.

Yeah I know, it's pretty crazy.  The country hospital they found him in was trying to keep him from going blind by dropping eyedrops into his eyes every few minutes.  The missionaries felt horrible for the kid and his family, so they offered to adopt him, and after pulling a few strings they brought him to a children's hospital in Boston to see if he could be helped.

So this awesome plastic surgeon there discovered that he could transplant the kids foreskin and create useable eyelids, and they saved the kids sight!

Everything worked, the surgery was successful.  Only problem now is that the kid is just a little bit cock-eyed.",Born with no eyelids,236

 One evening, Annabel, age 87, wandered into the garden. They begin to chat, and before they know it, several hours have passed. After a short lull in their conversation, Howard turns to Annabel and asks, “Do you know what I miss most of all?” 

She asks “What?” 

He replies “SEX!!!” 

Annabel exclaims, “Why you old fart, you couldn’t get it up if I held a gun to your head!” 

“I know”, Howard says, “but it would be nice if a woman just held it for a while.”

 “Well, I can oblige”, says Annabel, who gently unzips his trousers and removes his manhood and proceeds to hold it. 

They agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Annabel would hold Howard’s manhood. Then, one night, Howard didn’t show up at their usual meeting place. Alarmed, Annabel decided to find Howard and make sure that he was O.K. 

She walked around the home until she found him sitting by the pool with Sarah, who was holding Howard’s manhood!

count on a public toilet facility, an English woman was planning a trip to India She was registered to stay in a small guest house owned by the local Schoolmaster.She She was concerned as to whether the guest house contained a WC..In England , a bathroom is commonly called a WC which stands for 'Water Closet'.

She wrote to the schoolmaster inquiring of the facilities about the WC.
The school master, not fluent in English, asked the local priest if he
knew the meaning of WC.. Together they pondered possible meanings of
the letters and concluded that the lady wanted to know if there was a

 'Wayside Church' near the house . . . a bathroom never entered their minds.

So the schoolmaster wrote the following reply:


Dear Madam,
               I take great pleasure in informing you that the WC is
located 9 miles from the house.

It is located in the middle of a grove of pine trees, surrounded by
lovely grounds. It is capable of holding 229 people and is open on
Sundays and Thursdays.


As there are many people expected in the summer months, I suggest you
arrive early. There is, however, plenty of standing room.

This is an unfortunate situation especially if you are in the habit of
going regularly.It may be of some interest to you that my daughter was
married in the WC, as it was there, that she met her husband. It was a
wonderful event.There were 10 people in every seat. It was wonderful
to see the expressions on their faces. We can take photos in different
angle.

My wife, sadly, has been ill and unable to go recently. It has been
almost a year since she went last, which pains her greatly.You will be
pleased to know that many people bring their lunch and
make a day of it. Others prefer to wait till the last minute and
arrive just in time. I would recommend your ladyship plan to go on a
Thursday as there is an organ accompaniment. The acoustics are
excellent and even the most delicate sounds can be heard everywhere.


The newest addition is a bell which rings every time a person
enters.We are holding a bazaar to provide plush seats for all, since
many feel it is long needed.

I look forward to escorting you there myself and seating you in a
place where you can be seen by all.

With deepest regards,
The Schoolmaster

""What do you do then?""

""I'll give you an example,"" the logician answered. ""Do you have an aquarium?""

""Well, then you probably have a fish too?"" 

""That's correct."" he said

""Since you have a fish i'm gonna guess you like animals too?""

""Well, i guess, animals are often nice to be around.""

""Well since you like to be around animals, maybe you like to be around people to?""

He nodded, as he prefer to be with others than being alone.

""Maybe you like ladies then too?""

He sertanly did! He was pretty amazed over how this worked, and though he better try this himself.

The next day when he went to work his boss asked him how the trip was.

Unfortunately for the clown, a cop was waiting on a stretch of road. The clown flies by the cop, who promptly sounds the sirens. The cop eventually catches up and pulls the clown over.

The cop gets out of the patrol car, walks up the the clown's car, and sees the clown in the driver's seat.

""Huh, lookee here. I pulled over a clown car. Where's the rest of them?"" said the cop

""They're already at the circus. I'm running late. If I don't hurry, I won't make it to the show."" said the clown

""Well, I'll tell you what.. "" said the cop, as he walks away.

The cop walks back to his patrol car, opens the trunk, and takes out five emergency flares. He walks back the the clown's car.

""If you can juggle these here flares, I won't write you a ticket."" said the cop.

""Is that all? That'll be easy"" said the clown.

The clown gets out of his car, lights the flares, and begins juggling them with no problems.

All of the sudden, a big, red truck comes flying past. The truck serves off the road to an abrupt stop. The driver's door opens, and a redneck shambles out, looking clearly drunk. He stumbles his way over to the patrol car, opens the back door, and gets in.

The cop runs to his patrol car, opens the back door, and throws the redneck out to the ground.

""What the hell do you think you're doing?! You can't get in my car like that!"" said the cop

The redneck picks himself up off the ground and says ""Shit, officer. I'm turning myself in. There's no way in hell I can pass that drunk test.""

The programmer leans over to the engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game.

The engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.

The programmer persists and explains that the game is real easy and is a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $5.""

Again, the engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep.

The programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""OK, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $100!""

This catches the engineer's attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game.

The programmer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the programmer.

Now, it's the engineer's turn. He asks the programmer ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?""

The programmer looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers--all to no avail.

After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $100. The engineer politely takes the $100 and turns away to try to get back to sleep. The programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the engineer and asks ""Well, so what's the answer?"" Without a word, the engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the programmer $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.

The population of this country is 7 million. 
1 million are retired. 
That leaves 6 million to do the work. 
There are 4 1/2 million in school or college, which leaves 1 1/2 million to do the work. 
Of this there are 1/2 million employed by the government, leaving 1 million to do 
 the work. 
1/2 million are in the armed forces, which leaves 1/2 million to do the work. 
Take from the total the 400,000 people who are unemployed, and 
that leaves 100,000 to do the work. 
At any given time there are 75,000  people in hospitals or on holiday, 
leaving 25,000 to do the work

Benning, GA.  Desert Storm had just finished less than a year previously and we were one of the first classes of new infantry officers to get a look at all the cool intelligence from Iraq.  We were there for an ultra-serious national security lecture.

There were at least 200 young officers listening to Colonels and Generals discuss various Geo-Political issues.   Questions from the audience were taken, as we listened intently about Saddam Hussein's suppression of the Kurds, or what King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia thought.   ""What would happen if..."" were the types of questions being asked.

In front of all these senior officers, one of my fellow young officers raises his hand and stands to ask his question completely straight-faced, ""If Turkey attacked Iraq in the rear, would Greece help?""

There was near pandemonium for 5 solid minutes as the General tried to compose himself.  I still remember the joke tellers name, ""C"" but since this is a public forum, I'll keep it back.  I have never heard any crowd of people ever laugh so hard before or since.  Had to pay homage to the single best delivered joke I've ever heard.","True Story of Joke Told at Ft Benning, GA",9

The problem was that no matter how much she enjoyed seeing them, she hated flying. No matter how safe people told her it was, she was always worried that someone would have a bomb on the plane. 

She read books about how safe it was and listened to the stewardess demonstrate all the safety features. But she still worried herself silly every time a visit was coming up. 

Finally, the family decided that maybe if she saw the statistics she'd be convinced. So they sent her to a friend of the family who was an actuary. 

""Tell me,"" she said suspiciously, ""what are the chances that someone will have a bomb on a plane?"" 

The actuary looked through his tables and said, ""A very small chance. Maybe one in five hundred thousand."" 

She nodded, then thought for a moment. ""So what are the odds of two people having a bomb on the same plane?"" 

Again he went through his tables. 

""Extremely remote,"" he said. ""About one in a billion."" 

Aunt Bessie nodded and left his office.

2. Hey folks, we're going to play a little game of geography trivia. If you can recognize where we are, tell your flight attendant and receive an extra pack of peanuts.

3. Our loss of altitude allows a unique close up perspective of the local terrain. I assure you that it's all part of our airline's new commitment to make your a flight a sight seeing extravaganza. 

4. Goose! Bogey at 2 o'clock....one on our tail!!!! Eject!!!! Eject!!!!!!!

5. Ummmmmm....Sorry......(silence) 

6. (As the plane turns around right after takeoff)....uhhhhh....we have to go back ....we ..we ....uhhhhhh ....forgot something..... 

7. I'm sure everyone noticed the loss of an engine, however the reduction in weight and drag will mean we'll be flying much more efficiently now.

8. Fasten your seat belt. (same tone your friend with the suicidal driving tendencies uses when you get in the car).

9. This is your Captain speaking....these stupid planes are a lot different than the ships I'm used to.. so you'll have to give me some leeway... 

10. It would be a good idea if right now everyone closed their shades and watched the in-flight movie.

11. We've now reached our cruising altitude of 20,000 feet and ... Oh noooooooo!!!!!.. 

12. Don't worry! That one is always on E...

The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses.

At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.

The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.

Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.

When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne.

Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""",Blind Pilot,73

I do physical labor.

I work at great depths.

I plunge head first into everything I do.

I do not get weekends or public holidays off.

I work in a damp environment.

I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation.

I work in high temperatures.

My work exposes me to contagious diseases.

Sincerely,

The Response:

Dear P. Niss:

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons:

You do not work 8 hours straight.

You fall asleep after brief work periods.

You do not always follow the orders of the management team.

You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.

You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.

You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.

You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing.

You will retire well before you are 65.

You are unable to work double shifts.

You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed assigned task.

And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.

Sincerely,
V. Gina","I, the Penis, hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons:........",981

The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighborhood after they retired. Holding hands they walked back to their old school. It was not locked, so they entered, and found the old desk they had shared where Andy had carved 'I love you Sally!'

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up, and not knowing what to do with it, they took it home.
There, she counted the money: ""50,000.00!""


Andy said, 'We've got to give it back.'


Sally said, 'Finders keepers.' She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.


The next day, the FBI was canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money. They knocked on the door. 'Pardon me, but did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?' Sally said, 'No.' Andy said, 'She's lying. She hid it up in the attic.'
Sally said, ""Don't listen to him, he's getting senile.'

One of them comments that she hasn't been herself lately. The others agree, and someone suggests she needs a change. The woman agrees and decides she is going to take a trip.

The next morning she visits a travel agency, and books a three week trip to Africa.

When she gets there she has a wonderful time visiting museums, shopping, and so forth. Finally, as the main feature of her trip, she goes an a motorized safari through the jungle. She gets into an open top jeep, along with her guide and driver, and a number of other tourists. The jeep travels down this rugged, dark trail, deeper and deeper into the wild. They manage to spot all kinds of wildlife, when the guide tells the driver to stop. Up ahead are baby gorillas playing in the trees. 

The woman stands up to take a photo, when suddenly this huge male gorilla swings by on a vine and snatches the woman around the waist. He swings on with her to another vine and another, taking her deep into the jungle, far from the trail.

After what seems like hours he drops her into a sort nest, high up in a tree, where he brutally has his way with her. Afterwards, he leaves her for the night. Because she is so high up and so shocked she cannot make it down for the tree. 

The gorilla returns the next day with an armload of bananas and melons and other fruits. He then assaults her again, and leaves. This goes on for a number of days.

Finally, one morning, she spots the safari driver and guide searching for her. They find her and manage to get her down. They bundle her out of the jungle and take her to a hospital in a nearby city.

After a few days in the hospital and a few weeks of rest at a hotel, she flies back to NYC.

Eventually, one Sunday, she meets her friends for brunch. They are all very excited to hear about her trip to Africa. She tells them the whole story, including her abduction by the gorilla. Afterwards, one of her friends says, ""Oh honey! It must have been TERRIBLE for you!""

She responds, ""You have no idea... It's been two months now. He doesn't call! He doesn't write!""",Gorilla Romance,3

Obviously disturbed, the man calls over the waiter and says ""Excuse me, waiter. There seems to be a problem with my meal, there is something in there that keeps popping the lid and looking out at me,""

The waiter starts to speak when suddenly, the lid pops up, and a resonating QUACK echos from the pot. The man and woman jumps back, as the waiter chuckles at the situation. The waiter then replies:

She lives alone, and offers to make us both dinner. We eat, we talk, it's real pleasant. After dinner she walks over to me, leans in close and asks,

""Is there... *anything else* I can do for you?""

Well, dinner was good, and the dessert topped it off real nice, so I patted my stomach and told her I was fine, but thanks all the same.

We retire to the living room, and she offers me the big soft recliner. Pours us some scotch, we drink and laugh. It starts getting late, she walks over to me, stands behind the chair and rubs my shoulders. She asks, 

""Is there... *anything else* I can do for you?""

Well the shoulder rub feels mighty nice, so I tell her I'm fine, but thanks all the same.

It's real late now and I gotta walk for gas in the morning. I retire to her guest room, settle in and get comfy. Right as I'm dozing off, the door creaks open. She's standing in the doorway wearing pajamas that're almost transparent. She flips her hair over her shoulder and asks, 

""Is there... *anything else* I can do for you?""

It'd been a long day, I'm tired, I yawn and tell her I'm fine, but thanks all the same. In the morning I go get gas and drive on to the city.""
