The witch felt charitable, looking upon the poor body-less infant, and told Eddie's mother that not only would the boy be fine, she would also make him a body! However, the body wouldn't be ready until Eddie's 10th birthday. Extatic, Eddie's mother thanked the witch and left, returning periodically to check on the body's progress and to drop off small gifts.

Eddie was raised as normally as a child without a body could be. Though he could not do any manual work with his father and brothers, he was quite adept at organizing his family's small plot of land, ensuring they always had enough surplus crop to pay their due to the local lord. Eddie loved his family and they loved him back, and the years passed fairly pleasantly. 

Finally, Eddie's 10th birthday arrived, and his mother retrieved the boy's new body from the witch. His mother had, of course, kept the body a secret from Eddie all these years, wanting it to be the most wonderful surprise. 

As she returned to the house, Eddie's mother called out, ""Eddie, guess what very special gift I've brought you for your birthday?""

 Carl never liked swimming, and thought that perhaps being a hen wouldn’t be that bad after all. Walking around pecking at the ground, no stress, and if the local rooster was nice then perhaps it could be a comfortable existence.

 Carl replied, “Okay, then I choose to be a hen.”The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground.

A rooster strolled past. “So, you’re the new hen, eh? How’s your first day here?”“Not bad,” replied  Carl the hen, “but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I’m gonna explode!”“You’re ovulating,” explained the rooster. “Don’t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before?”  

“Never,” said  Carl.“Well, just cluck twice and then push.” Carl clucked twice and pushed, and voila, out popped an egg!

 Carl was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood for the first time. He then clucked twice, pushed, and out came another egg. His joy was overwhelming.

""Hey, look at this big sonofabitch I caught!"" The second alter boy looks at him and says,

""You can't say that we're Catholic."" 

The first alter boy responds with ""no no don't worry, that's the name of the fish""

""Are you sure?""

""Yeah yeah I swear""

""We should go show father!"" So the boys walked back up the trail and into the cathedral.

""Father, look at this big sonofabitch we caught!"" 

""Blasphomy you can't say that!"" The priest responded

""No no it's okay that's the name of the fish.""

""Are you sure?"" 

""Yeah yeah I swear""

The boys had the bright idea of going to show the Cardinal. 

""Sir, look at this big sonofabitch we caught!""

""You can't say that I'll have you excommunicated at once!""

""No no it's okay, that's the name of the fish""

""Are you sure?"" The Cardinal siad

""Yeah yeah I swear""

"" I recommend you show it to the nuns. I reckon it feed twenty people over.""

The boys walked to the nuns and said ""sister sister, look at this big sonofabitch we caught!"" And the nun says ""you can't say that! Your holy men!""

""No no it's alright, that's the name of the fish""

""Are you sure?""

""Yeah yeah I swear""

So that afternoon the nuns cooked the fish for dinner and it fed just as expected. Twenty people over. The boys walked out of the dining room and through the cathedral into the popes hall.

"" Your holiness, what did you think of that big sonofabitch!"" The pope froze for a moment and a smile slowly crept up his face.

""#37,"" the guy at the end of the bar says while chuckling to himself. All the other comics have a light laugh in response to this one.

""#114,"" another comedian says. This gets a stronger laugh, as it was the perfect follow up.

""#63,"" 

""#481."" 

Everyone was enjoying a good chuckle while they finished up their beers. About to head home for the night, the comedian at the end grabs his jacket and stands up. But before he heads out, he leans into the group and says, ""#203."" 

The group loses it. Everyone keels over, dying from laughter. One comic almost fell off of his chair, he was laughing so hard.

Finally, when the laughter settles down, the bartender asked why that joke was so funny.

Scientist: Well we started the tests on pumpkins, we infused a large amount of human dna into them and the results were... displeasing. They did form life but it was too barbaric and got itself extinct. 

Journalist: Ahh how upsetting, what else did you try?

Scientist: It became a theory that size of the subject could be a factor, so we tried Apples. Again infusing them with human dna, they turned out to be better than the pumpkins. They were far less barbaric, but acted like herbivore livestock, we liked to compare them to cows. They didn't really do much, they just ate grass and pooped.

Journalist: Were there any successful test results?

Scientist: Yes actually, we tried the test once more on the smallest subjects we had at our disposal, peas. Infusing the peas with human dna resulted in a brilliance abundance of life. These peas were extremely intelligent, in just a matter of hours they set up a town, overnight they made a nest as enormous and complex as a typical city full of around 100,000 peas.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

After all, the son had been training for years and had the best coach in the nation. But, by the time things progressed to the quarterfinals, his times didn't look good. Michael's son was in dead last.

""Dad, I don't think I'm going to win this one. I'm sorry."" he said.

""Have no fear, son. I swam in tournaments for years. I know a few tricks."" replied Michael.

""Tricks? Like cheating?"" inquired the son.

""No, nothing like that."" said Michael. ""It's all about aerodynamics. For example, your swim trunks are medium sized. Go into the locker room and change into a small. You'll be more streamlined and go faster.""

The boy did as instructed, and proceeded to the quarterfinals. The gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was able to advance to the semifinals... but only, just barely.

""Well, Dad, I think that helped, but I think I'm doomed. Even with the extra speed, I can never win the semifinals"".

""Son, I know another trick. It's all about aerodynamics. Your noseplugs-- they're too big. Switch your current ones out for a smaller size. It will reduce the drag on your face in the water and give you a little speed boost.""

Again, the boy did as he was told, proceeding to the semifinals with smaller nose plugs. Once again, the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was surprised to find that he was able to advance to the finals... but only, just barely.

""Dad, thank you for all you've done for me. But, I think I'm doomed. There's no way I can win now. I think we're all out of tricks.""

""Not so, son. I have one last trick. It's all about aerodynamics. You wear a size medium swimming cap. Take it off and wear a smaller size. It will make you more streamlined and get your blood flowing better. If you do this, you have a really good chance of winning.""

The boy did as instructed. Once again, the gun went off. The final race began. The son started out with a massive lead, but then, something unexpected happened. The son made it halfway through the pool when he unexpectedly started rolling sideways, and then started bobbing up and down like a cork in the water.

Scientist: Well we started the tests on pumpkins, we infused a large amount of human dna into them and the results were... displeasing. They did form life but it was too barbaric and got itself extinct. 

Journalist: Ahh how upsetting, what else did you try?

Scientist: It became a theory that size of the subject could be a factor, so we tried Apples. Again infusing them with human dna, they turned out to be better than the pumpkins. They were far less barbaric, but acted like herbivore livestock, we liked to compare them to cows. They didn't really do much, they just ate grass and pooped.

Journalist: Were there any successful test results?

Scientist: Yes actually, we tried the test once more on the smallest subjects we had at our disposal, peas. Infusing the peas with human dna resulted in a brilliance abundance of life. These peas were extremely intelligent, in just a matter of hours they set up a town, overnight they made a nest as enormous and complex as a typical city full of around 100,000 peas.

Then, he shows the man a table with dirty water. “This is where you’ll get your drink.” Said the old man.

The old man hears out the young mans predicament, and allows him to stay for a night.  Later the young man hears strange noises coming from a red door on the other side of his room but goes to sleep anyway. Asking the old man the next morning what made those noises, he told him: 

“I can’t tell you, you’re not a priest.”

The young man takes off and several years pass.  Coincidentally, the same series of events happen later on where the young man gets another flat tire and goes to the old mans house knowing of his past generosity.  Once again the old man allows him to stay the night, and once again the younger man hears weird noises from the red door across the room where he sleeps.  The next morning he asks the old man what the noises are and he tells him:

“I can’t tell you, you’re not a priest.”

But this time, the young man IS a priest because he has finished that schooling and gotten a job at his local church.  Telling the old man this, he is given a set of rainbow keys and is led to the red door.  Putting the red key in the red door, the young man opens it and the old man tells gestures to him to move forward on his own.

After walking down a long hallway the man finds an orange door where he uses the orange key to open the orange door and he turns left.  He walks down another long hallway and finds a yellow door which he opens with the yellow key.  Turning right this time, he walks down one more hallway and opens a green door with the green key.  Going down a flight of stairs he unlocks the blue door with predictable methods now and with little light remaining in the room he locates the purple door.  Finally opening it with the last key, the young man gazed upon the source of the noises causing his confusion.

“What was it that caused the noise??” you are probably asking...

Well...

A husband and wife were out playing golf.

They tee off and one drive goes to the right and one drive goes to the left.

The wife finds her ball in a patch of buttercups.  

She grabs a club and takes a mighty swing at the ball.  

She hits a beautiful second shot, but in the process she hacks the hell out of the buttercups.

Suddenly a woman appears out of nowhere.  

She blocks her path to her golf bag and looks at her and says, ""I'm Mother Nature, and I don't like the way you treated my buttercups.  

From now on, you won't be able to stand the taste of butter.  

Each time you eat butter you will become physically ill to the

""However"" the old rooster added ""since i'm obviously much older, you must wait until i've completed half of the lap before starting, so I have a fair chance""

The younger rooster knew that even with that advantage, it was a shoe in, so he agreed.

The race started and the older rooster set off, by the half way point he was already huffing and puffing, feeling his age. The younger rooster sped off like a rocket and was quickly catching up. By the time the older rooster was at the three quarter mark, he was almost out of breath, heaving desperately. The younger rooster was coming up right behind him, was seconds away from beating him.

 When suddenly *BLAM!* The farmer's shotgun rang out, the new rooster collapsed into a bloody heap of feathers.

Lord Harold served under the king as a trusted and successful general in his army, and had the wealth to show for it.

One fateful week, when tensions were high between this kingdom and another, Harold though it would be a good idea to splurge on a new sword, so he headed for the smithy.

He barges into the blacksmith’s hut and shouts, “Smithy! I require an Enchanted blade! One so powerful my enemies will tremble in fear at the sight of its edge! I can pay handsomely.” 

The smithy was never one to deny a Lord, not could he if he wanted, so he says to Harold, “Aye, if ye want a enchanted blade, you’ll get one strong enough to crack a mountain, trusting I take my time with it.”

“Huzzah!” Harold says, he then describes the blade of his desires to the smithy, then takes his leave.

2 days pass and Harold checks on the Smithy and his progress, “How goes the sword, Smithy?”

The Smithy replies with “Excellent m’lord, carving out your pommel now! You’ll have it within 4 days!”

Delighted with the answer, Harold leaves for the day.

2 more days pass and Harold repeats the process, “Smithy! How is my blade? Can it slice the very air in my path?”

The Smithy replied with “She sure can! Just working out the last kinks now, you’ll have it in two days! 

Harold left for the evening but is then alerted by the king that the order to attack had been given and must leave tomorrow. Harold bursts into the Smith’s shop in the morning and demands the blade.

The Smithy says “But sire, the kinks!”
Harold has no time to waste, so he grabs the sword from the smithy and leaves a hefty coin purse.

The next morning Harold is woken by cannon fire. He bolts up from his bedding and rushes for the new sword, only to see that it had vanished. As he searched for it, he noticed that along with the blade, some of his wolf skins and leathers have been taken as well.

He dashed out of his tent enraged, hellbent on finding the thief. Amidst the smoldering embers of the nearby land, he spots an oddly familiar figure.

Harold runs for the figure and stops in his tracks when he sees it. There it is, his sword, it’s enchanted power possessing what seems to be a suit made entirely of furs, and using it to dance and prance around the battlefield. 

Harold is then pierced in the heart by an enemy archer, he falls to the ground.

The last words to go through Harold’s mind are not his own, but the Smithy’s.

The cowboy looks dumbfounded, so the bartender tells him he will give him a second to think it over.

So the cowboy asks the man sitting to his left who is sipping on a beer. ""Hey bud, what’s the name of yours?""

The man looks back and says with a smile, ""TIMEX.""

The thirsty cowboy asks. ""Why Timex?""

The fella proudly replies. ""‘Cause it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.""

Finally, he turns to the bartender and exclaims, ""The name of my willy is SECRET. Now give me a beer.""

Better safe than sorry, he said to himself and told his tribe that the winter was indeed expected to be cold and that the members of the village should stock up on firewood to be prepared.

After several days, our modern Chief got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. A week later he called the National Weather Service again. ""Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""It's going to be a very cold winter.""

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. Two weeks later the Chief called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible. The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him. After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Dallas Cowboys, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",Heartbreaking,521

press up against the base of your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.

When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need, a new suit."" Steve entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit.""

You could hear a pin drop. Bill had his urges but he would not surrender, the power of the nut would not defeat him.

Well, eventually it did and one not trying to be as silent as possible he tried to jack off, but unfortunately the man, Jeff, sleeping in the bunk next to his heard. “Dude can you not pleasure yourself right now, it’s very disturbing!” Jeff whispered for he was trying to be quiet too.
Bob replied, “I know but it’s been about a month and there’s no where else to do it, I can’t do it anymore!”

“Alright, there is something I know that not many of the others know. There’s a hollow tree just down the way with a hole in it, and if you stick your thing in there it will feel like the perfect pussy, try that tomorrow, okay?”
Bob, knowing there was no other way he was going to be able to bust a fat one knew this was the only way said, “Okay, I’ll do it tomorrow.”

He woke up the next day and went down the hill, only to find a big hollow tree and he doubted it would feel like a pussy but sure enough he stuck his wang in the hole and it felt magical. He was sure this tree had powers, and in just a minute, maybe less, he busted the perfect nut in the tree.

After thanking Jeff, for weeks on end he would continue to go to the tree and wank his brains out. And it felt great every time, he would go to sleep with no urges, but would wake up every morning and go to the tree, and on occasion would sneak there at night.

However, one day he got there, unzipped his pants, stuck his dong in the hole, the usual routine, but it was like he was having sex with air. He was very disappointed because now he wouldn’t be able to nut like he did before, he missed the feeling.

He went down the next day to check if it was the same and, alas, it was. Though this time when he exited the hole to see his bunk mate, Jeff, with his buckle undone. “Hey Jeff, the tree seems to have lost its powers it doesn’t feel like a buddy anymore, Bill sighed.

The man is dumbfounded and says, “this octopus can play the guitar?” The store owner replies, “not just the guitar. He can play any and every instrument known to man,” and proceeds to place a harp in front of it. The octopus plays a beautiful song on the harp, and the man figures he can use this octopus to bet people that his octopus could play any instrument and easily get back his $10,000.

When he gets to the bar he jumps on top of a table, holding the octopus high above his head, and announces, “I will bet anybody in the bar, any amount of money, that this octopus can play any instrument you set in front of him.” The bartender rolls out a piano, and says, “I’ll bet you $100 he cant play this.” So the man sets the octopus on the piano, and it plays the Pachelbel’s canon in D perfectly. Impressed, the bartender hands the man a crisp $100 bill. A drunk man jumps up and yells, “I bet you $5000 he cant play the drums.” The bartender brings out a drumset used for open mic night, and the octopus is sat on the seat, and continues to play  an incredible drum solo that leaves everyone in awe. The bar owner comes up to him and says, “I have an instrument behind the bar, and ill bet you $10,000 your octopus cant play it.” The man agrees and the bartender pulls out a set of bagpipes. Unbothered he sets the octopus on the bagpipes and waits eagerly. The octopus squirms around the bagpipes, using its tentacles to make some kind of melody. Theres a few notes here and there, but no real discernible melody. The octopus continues to roll around and squirm around the bagpipes, when the bar owner shouts excitedly, “I win! He cant play the bagpipes, and you owe me $10,000!” The man, completely unfazed, replies, “be patient.

A few days went by, and he comes home from work and again his wife asks for a favor, ""Honey, the car won't start, I think that it needs a new battery. Could you change it for me?""

""What do I look like, Mr. Goodwrench?"" was his response.

Another couple of weeks go by, and it's raining pretty hard.His wife then finds a leak in the roof. She pleads with him as he's walking through the door. ""Honey, there's a leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?""

He just looked at her and said, ""What do I look like,Bob Vila?"" and sat down with a beer and watched a game on tv.

One weekend the husband woke up and it was pouring pretty hard, but the leak on the roof was gone!

Speaking of leaks, he also went to take a shower, and he found that the one pipe behind the sink wasn't leaking anymore either.

His wife was coming home just then, and as she walked through the door, the husband asked, ""Honey, how come there aren't anymore leaks, and the car's running?""

She replied nonchalantly, ""Oh, the other day I was picking up the mail, and I ran into one of our new neighbors, Jon. What a nice man. He came over and fixed everything.""

""Wow, did he charge us anything?"" asked the husband.

""No, he just said that he'd do it for free if I either baked him a cake or had sex with him."" she said.
