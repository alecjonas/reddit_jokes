He lived with his wife who was also a Nike shoe and together they had identical twins, an adorable pair of two left Nike shoes. 

But Nike shoe wasn’t happy. You see, he hated his job--the mundane monotony of never being the shoe he knew he could be. One day at breakfast, he began to converse with his wife, “Honey, my job at the plant is wasting away at my sole. I need to go work somewhere else...to be someone else.”

His wife was hesitant, but wanted more than anything for her husband to be happy. “I think you should quit then. You don’t owe your happiness to anyone else but yourself, Nike shoe.” 
And like that, Nike shoe quit his job at the plant, finally telling his boss to step off and that he was done there forever. 

In the weeks following, Nike shoe finally realized his passion: painting. He got great at making these incredible, detailed, amazing paintings and for the first time in a long, long time, Nike shoe felt really, truly happy. 

But the bills stacked up, and Nike shoe had trouble selling his work. His pieces were good--of course they were good!--but getting recognized seemed like an impossibility. And his wife began to worry. And his kids began to get hungry.

 Until one day...he was once again at breakfast with his wife and kids and saw an ad in the newspaper. SHOE CARTOONIST WANTED, it read. This was Nike shoe’s chance! He called in and set an interview for later that very day. 

Once at the paper, Nike shoe looked around. There were other artists there as well trying to get the same exact job. Nike shoe began to fret as he looked around at all the more qualified applicants, but trusting in himself and his paintings, he foot his fears and went right into his interview with the newspaper head. 

Handing over his best paintings to the newspaper head, Nike shoe felt anxious. He thought about his wife and kids at home. He thought about leaving his job at the plant. Were his paintings good enough? Why wasn’t the newspaper head saying anything?!

But finally he set down Nike shoe’s paintings and spoke. 

“Nike shoe, these are some of the most beautiful paintings I have ever seen. The intricacies, the lines, the details---They are all simply incredible,” Nike shoe felt a rush--this was his moment! 

“Does that mean I’m hired?”

“No...no. I’m sorry. You’re a good artist, Nike shoe, and a wonderful painter! I feel like I should have made the ad more clear….


We’re really only looking for skechers.”

After an hour of walking, he realized it was a bar on top of the hill. He found a path that was surrounded by a fence on both sides and climbed the sem-steep hill. Finally relieved to reach the top, he entered the bar and took a seat. 

Bill ordered a beer and the barman happily obliged pouring him a draft.

""Yes, yes I did."" Bill answered, ""It was very helpful leading me up the steep hill.""

""I built it myself,"" the barman jabbed a thumb into his chest, ""But do they call me Craig the Fence Maker? Noooo, of course not.""

Bill found that strange but was content to drink his beer before asking for directions.

 and told the receptionist she
 wanted to see the lawyer about having a will prepared. The receptionist
 suggested they set up an appointment for a convenient time for the spinster
 to come into the office.

 The woman replied, ""You must understand, I've lived alone all my life, I
 rarely see anyone, and I don't like to go out. Would it be possible for the
 lawyer to come to my house?""

 The receptionist checked with the attorney who agreed and he went to the
 spinster's home for the meeting to discuss her estate and the will. The
 lawyer's first question was, ""Would you please tell me what you have in
 assets and how you'd like them to be distributed under your will?""

 She replied, ""Besides the furniture and accessories you see here, I have
 $40,000 in my savings account at the bank.""

 ""Tell me,"" the lawyer asked, ""how would you like the $40,000 to be
 distributed?""

 The spinster said, ""Well, as I've told you, I've lived a reclusive life,
 people have hardly ever noticed me, so I'd like them to notice when I pass
 on. I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral.""

 The lawyer remarked, ""Well, for $35,000 you will be able to have a funeral
 that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lasting impression on anyone
 who may not have taken much note of you! But tell me,"" he continued, ""what
 would you like to do with the remaining $5,000?""

 The spinster replied, ""As you know, I've never married, I've lived alone
 almost my entire life, and in fact I've never slept with a man. Before I
 die, I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me.""

 ""This is a very unusual request,"" the lawyer said, adding, ""but I'll see
 what I can do to arrange it and get back to you."" That evening, the lawyer
 was at home telling his wife about the eccentric spinster and her weird
 request. After thinking about how much she could do around the house with
 $5,000, and with a bit of coaxing, she got her husband to agree to provide
 the service himself.

 She said, ""I'll drive you over tomorrow morning, and wait in the car until
 you're finished."" The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house
 and waited while he went into the house. She waited for over an hour, but
 her husband didn't come out. So she blew the car horn.

 Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck his head out
 and yelled, ""Pick me up tomorrow! She's going to let the County bury her!""",An elderly spinster called the lawyer's office,30

He was 71. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out, including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who ""never knew how much he was kneaded"". 

Doughboy rose quickly in show business but his later life was filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, even as a crusty old man, he was considered a roll model for millions. 

Toward the end it was thought he'd rise once again, but he was no tart. Doughboy is survived by his second wife, Play Dough. They have two children, and one in the oven. 

The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

What’s even more interesting is that they all look identical: same little freckle on the top, same patterns, even exactly the same colour! “This really is unusual,” he exclaims, and decides to investigate into this phenomenon further.

He decides to put the eggs through three tests to see if they remain similar all the time. For the first test, he takes twenty of the eggs and smashes them over a brick with his hands. Joe checks the interior of the shell, and each one is different in some way, in most occasions due to the thickness of the shell. He makes his observations: “sadly the shells on the brick were different.”

The second and third tests consist of cooking tests in different environments. For the second test, Joe hires out a private jet, takes twenty more eggs, then flies up above the clouds and sets about making scrambled eggs whilst the plane is on autopilot. He mashes the eggs up and makes a mean plate of scrambled eggs, but once more the eggs are all different. Feeling downbeat and hoping for maybe one positive result, he makes his observations: “the scrambled eggs on the plane were different.”

For the final test, Joe goes out of his way to prove his theory. This time he hires out an old navy submarine to do his experiment in, complete with a fully functioning team of crew. Impatient and desperate, he grabs twenty more eggs and hurried aboard.

As the crew get them deeper under the water and the light outside fades, Joe sets about frying his eggs. All of them are going smoothly except for one, which is rocking slightly. At first Joe thinks nothing of it, but as the vessel gets into deeper depths and the cooking continues, the egg rocks more and more violently until it bursts and yolk spurts everywhere! Joe watches in astonishment as it shrinks and bubbles on the stove... next to nineteen perfectly similar yellow mounds.

“It can’t be!” Joe shouts to himself as he studies the eggs in more detail. Every single one is the same in every aspect, albeit the bursting egg. In his frenzied excitement, he is able to make one final observation whilst clutching the egg that burst from within its mother: “all the yolks on this sub are the same, but this one is original!”",Old farmer Joe is checking on his chickens,210

it swears even more.

then he locks it in it's cage and sticks in in the basement alone, and it starts screaming obscenities.

the parrot says ""ok, ok. I will never swear again.""
the parrot says ""but can I ask one thing?""

Finally, after many exasperating months, the mother bursts out with, ""Listen, son: Every time you suck that thumb, you're making your tummy fill with air, okay? It's going to get fatter and fatter until one day...*boom*, you'll pop! Do you want that?"" 

The kid goes wide-eyed and shakes his head. ""No, Mommy.""

""Do you understand now?""

""Yes, Mommy.""

This seemed to finally do the trick. After three thumbsucking-free days, the mom decides to reward her kid with ice cream. As the two of them sit on a park bench later that day enjoying their cones, a heavily pregnant woman stops to rest on the bench right across from them.

The little boy's mouth drops open as he catches sight of her. Before his mother can say anything, he slips off the bench and approaches the pregnant woman.

The pregnant woman smiles at the boy as he nears her. ""Hello, little boy.""

""Hi,"" he says. He motions to her bulging stomach. ""May I please touch it?""

""Sure,"" she responds graciously.

He pats her stomach in wonder and then gives her a sly, knowing smile.

""Well I know what *you've* been doing!"" he says. ",A five year old boy won't stop sucking his thumb...,92

He found another part of his local river, one that was completely frozen over. It was a harsh winter, after all.

He sat down on the river bank, began to unpack his fishing equipment and suddenly heard a deep and powerful voice from above.

""There are no fish in there.""

He was slightly startled, but thought little more of it and continued to unpack.

About ten seconds later, however:

""There are no fish in there.""

He felt no choice but to look up and respond.

""Is that you God...?""

""...no, this is the skating rink owner.""

Once all her ingredients gathered, she sat the young noble on a chair, closed her eyes and concentrated, while performing complex gestures. Watching her intensely, the man commented that she should really see a dermatologist about the wart on her nose, and that he would be happy to recommend one who had in fact cured his aunt's toe wart a few years back, but that might be a bit too expensive for a witch, so never mind.

A couple of nights ago, I was out for a few drinks with some friends and had a few too many beers and then topped it off with a margarita.  Not a good idea.

Knowing full well I was at least slightly over the limit, I did something I've never done before: I took a taxi home.

Sure enough I passed a police road block but because it was a taxi, they waved it past.

I arrived home safely without incident, which was a real surprise.

I have never driven a taxi before and am not sure where I got it.

""This is not your bedroom,"" the man replied, ""I’m St. Peter, and you are in heaven.""

What! Are you saying I’m dead? I don’t want to die! I'm too young,"" said Tom. ""I want you to send me back immediately.""

""It's not that easy"", said St. Peter. You can only return as a dog or a hen. The choice is your own.""

Tom thought about it for a while, and figured out that being a dog is too tiring, but a hen probably has a nice and relaxed life. Running around with a rooster can't be that bad.

""I want to return as a hen,"" Tom replied.

And in the next second, he found himself in a chicken run, really nicely feathered. But now he felt like his rear end was gonna blow. Then along came the rooster.

""Hey, you must be the new hen St. Peter told me about,"" he said. ""How do you like being a hen?""

""Well, OK I guess, but it feels like my ass is about to explode.""

""Oh that!"" said the rooster. ""That's only the ovulation going on. You need to lay an egg.""
""How do I do that?"" Tom asked.

""Cluck twice, and then you push all you can.""

Tom clucked twice and pushed more than he was good for, and then 'plop' an egg was on the ground.
""Wow"" Tom said. ""That felt really good!"" So he clucked again and squeezed. And you better believe that there was yet another egg on the ground. The third time he clucked, he heard his wife shout:
""Tom, for Christ's sake! Wake up! You're shitting' all over the bed!""

They rode in a silver 1934 Bentley to the edge of Central London where they boarded an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificent white horses.
As they rode towards Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side and waving to thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all was going well. This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry and dignity.
Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip the most horrendous, earth-shattering, cheek-flapping, eyes-smarting blast of flatulence, and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes.
Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that was a most ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassing situation. She turned to Mr. Putin and explained, ""President Putin, please accept my regrets. I’m sure you understand that there are some things even a Queen cannot control.""

HELP WANTED. Must be able to type, must be good with a computer and must be bilingual. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer

A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went inside. He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined.

Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so he lead him into the office. Inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager.

The manager said, ""I can’t hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type."" The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair. The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be good with a computer.""

The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager. 

By this time the manager was totally dumb-founded! He looked at the dog and said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I *still* can’t give you the job.""

The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the sentences that told about being an Equal Opportunity Employer. The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign *also* says that you have to be bilingual.""

The dog looked at him straight in the face and said, ""Meow."" ",Looking for Office help..,179

So the mortician rolled him over. Seamus looked and said ""Nope, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician thought that was rather strange and then he brought Sean in to identify the body.

Sean took a look at him and said, ""Yup, he's burnt real bad, roll him over.""

The mortician rolled him over and Sean looked down and said, ""No, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician asked, ""How can you tell?""

Sean said, ""Well, Paddy had two arseholes.""

""What? He had two arseholes?"" asked the mortician.

""Yup, everyone knew he had two arseholes. Every time we went into town, folks would say, 'Here comes Paddy with them two arseholes....'""",Paddy died in a fire and was burnt pretty badly,9596

This would have struck him as odd, except that he was too drunk to notice anything out of the ordinary. 


""Hey,"" he said to the bartender, ""there's a horse standing next to me.""


""I know"" replied the bartender wiping a glass. ""That horse comes in here all the time and you know once, just once, I'd like to see him show some kind of expression. He must be part Vulcan or something."" 


The bum looked at the horse's face. A better poker player could not exist on this earth. ""Uh-huh.""


 ""Tell ya what,"" the bartender suggested, ""I'll give you a free round of drinks if you can make him laugh."" 


The bum thought for a second or two, then said, ""Sure."" 

He took the horse by the reins and led him into the men's bathroom. A moment later, he and the horse came out again, and the horse was laughing uproariously. 


Stunned, the bartender poured the bum's free round of drinks without taking his eyes off the animal. ""That was amazing!"" he told the bum as he finished off his last drink. ""I'll give you another free round of drinks if you can make him cry!""

Smiling, the bum said, ""All right,"" and once again led the horse into the men's room. 


When they came out a minute later, the horse was wallowing in tears. Shaking his head and rubbing his disbelieving eyes, the bartender poured the bum his second round of drinks. 


""You've gotta tell me,"" he said as the bum finished his drink, ""how on earth did you get that horse to laugh and cry?"" 


""Well,"" said the bum, clearing his throat with pride, ""First I told him that my dick was longer than his, and then I proved it.""",(long) An oldy but goody! A horse was in a bar.,3

""I am the Genii of the Lamp. You have summoned me, and I must grant you 3 wishes of whatever you desire"", he said in a great booming voice. 
""Anything I desire?"", I asked?
""Anything.""
""Alright,"" I said, ""then for my first wish, I wish for a brand new car!""
""As you wish"", so saying he clapped his hands and there was a mighty thunderclap and a wind that shook the house. 
Running outside I saw there was a brand new BMW where my old clunker had been parked. I ran back in excitedly, ""For my second wish, I wish for a million dollars!""
""As you wish"", he again said, clapping his hands. And again there was the thunder and the wind. And immediately there was a large stack of hundred dollar bills on the table.
I could barely contain my excitement at this point: so many things I could wish for, but only one wish left. ""I wish for all my dreams to come true!""
""As you wish"", he said, even louder than before. And once again he clapped his hands. Once more the mighty thunder roared. Once more the wind nearly shook the house apart.

He gets to the edge of the town and finds its on top of a hill he can't climb.  However, when he looks around, he finds a set of stairs which he can climb.  It was late by the time he went into the village proper, and only the pub had its lights on, and so he enters.

Inside, the place was cozy, warm and full of fantastic wooden furniture.  The old bartender looks over at him.  ""Oh dear the sight of you, take off those dirty things, I'll have my wife wash them, you can wear some of my old things...""

Joe then says that Ann sang the National Anthem while simultaneously sucking him off.
Phil, who is completely shocked by this discovery, asks for Joe's approval to try to hook up with Ann. Joe gives his approval.
So the next day, Phil asks Ann out and she says how she's hoped that Phil would ask her out for some time now. That night, after their date, Phil and Ann go back to his place and head straight to the bedroom (I feel that I should mention that Ann is a bit easy if you know what I mean).
Anyways, they start making out and then Ann starts to go down on Phil. She asks Phil to turn the light off to set the mood. He, of course, reaches over and flips the lights off. Ann then starts sucking his dick and Phil is loving it. Shortly after, Ann begins to sing the National Anthem with such a beautiful voice. Phil is practically in tears by the amazing blowjob and the beauty of her voice. Phil slowly reaches for the light switch because he really wants to know how she's doing both things simultaneously. He finally reaches the light switch.
Once the lights are turned on, Ann immediately stops and runs out of the room. Phil sits up and looks down at the floor and sees a glass eye...",NSFW The National Anthem and a blowjob,1

In the lake looking up at the fly is a fish, and the fish is hungry. It's looking at the fly thinking ""if that fly were to just drop six inches, i could jump up and grab it, and have a tasty meal"". 

There's a bear on the shore. It's looking at the fish, who is just out reach and thinking ""if that fly were to just drop six inches, the fish would jump and grab it, then I could grab the fish and have a tasty meal"". 

There's a Hunter in the woods near the shore. He spies the bear and thinks to himself ""Wow! He's big, but I don't have a clear shot. But if that fly were to just drop six inches then the fish would go for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, then I could shoot the bear. Then I'd have myself a trophy and could eat my picnic, and have a tasty meal"". 

Nearby is a mouse. It sees the hunter's picnic and thinks ""damn, that piece of cheese looks good. If that fly were to just drop six inches, the fish would go for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, the hunter would go for the bear, and while he's distracted I could go and get the cheese. Then I'd have a tasty meal"". 

Meanwhile, a cat has been creeping up on the mouse but can't quite get to him yet. And the cat thinks ""hmmm, if that fly would just drop six inches then the fish would go for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, the hunter would go for the bear, and the mouse would go for the cheese. Then I can get the mouse and have a tasty meal"". 

Suddenly, it happens. 

The fly drops six inches and the fish leaps up to catch it. The fish is immediately snatched up by the bear who is then shot by the hunter. As the hunter runs out to claim his trophy the mouse makes a dash for the cheese. Finally the cat leaps at the mouse......and misses completely, landing in the lake. 

Now every story has a moral, and the lesson we can take here is this:
