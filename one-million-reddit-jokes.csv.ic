He consulted with his sister and decided after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note, not too romantic and not too personal.
Off he went with his sister to Harrods ladies dept and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves.
His sister bought a pair of knickers for herself at the same time. Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Ron got the knickers. Good old Ron sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter:

Dear Sasha,

I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled at all.
I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.

All my love
Ron.

P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",A present for the girlfriend.,22

At that very moment, he spots Andy Samberg double fisting a bourbon and beer near the bar. 

Excusing himself from Mickelson, he explains that he has an action-comedy script he’s been shopping around to Hollywood studios that he thinks Samberg would be absolutely perfect for. 

Chan makes his way over to the usually genial Samberg and introduces himself.

Unbeknownst to him, however, Samberg is in no mood for polite conversation, let alone networking.

In fact, he’s spent the last hour in the bar pounding drinks and brooding over his poor performance: a dismal 17 shots over par. 

Believing that the new movie idea could be his biggest hit since Rush Hour, Chan persists and starts to give his elevator pitch. 

Before Chan can finish his first sentence, Samberg interrupts by punching him in the face and drunkenly slurring something about payback for Pearl Harbor. 

Astonished, Chan yells, “You ignorant fool! That was Japan. I’m Chinese!”

Still slurring, and now swaying to and fro, Samberg mutters, “Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese...what’s the difference?”

To that, Chan delivers a swift and decisive blow across Samberg’s face which knocks him to the floor.

Hardly remembering the events that led to his unfortunate situation, Samberg sheepishly groans, “what was that for?”

Uncharacteristically, Chan booms, “THAT WAS FOR THE TITANIC!”

“C’mon man! The Titanic? That was an iceberg!” 

Smiling, Chan shrugs and replies, “Samberg, Goldberg, iceberg...what’s the difference?”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?' 

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded. 

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?' 

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.' 

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find. 

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. 

'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The man replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, 

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'

So, he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he has a rooster that he would sell. The other farmer says, “Yep, I’ve got this great rooster, named Kenny. He’ll service every chicken you got, no problem.”

Well, Kenny the rooster costs $3,000, a lot of money, but the farmer decides he’d be worth it. So, he buys Kenny. The farmer takes Kenny home and sets him down in the barnyard, but first he gave the rooster a pep talk. “I want you to pace yourself now. You’ve got a lot of chickens to service here, and you cost me a lot of money. Consequently, I’ll need you to do a good job.! So, take your time and have some fun,” the farmer said, with a chuckle.!
Kenny seems to understand, so the farmer points toward the hen house and Kenny takes off like a shot. WHAM! Kenny nails every hen in the hen house - three or four times, and the farmer is really shocked.

After that, the farmer hears a commotion in the duck pen and, sure enough, Kenny is in there. Later, the farmer sees Kenny after a flock of geese down by the lake. Once again - WHAM! He gets all the geese. By sunset he sees Kenny out in the fields chasing quail and pheasants.
The farmer is distraught and worried that his expensive rooster won’t even last 24 hours. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the next morning to find Kenny on his back out in the middle of the yard, mouth open, tongue hanging out and both feet sticking straight up in the air. Buzzards are circling overhead.
The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful and expensive animal, shakes his head and says, “Oh, Kenny, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you’ve done to yourself.”

Kenny opens one eye, nods toward the buzzards circling in the sky and says, “Shhhh .. they’re getting closer.”",Kenny the Rooster,58

The man popped the hood open and spent a few moments just cursing about the situation and trying to fix the engine, but he was no mechanic, so it seemed like futile effort. His cell phone wasn't picking up any signal, there were no other drivers on the road and the closest gas station was too far away to reach in a day's walk.

When the man started losing hope, he noticed a horse trotting towards him. It was white with a dark patch on his forehead. The horse stopped a few feet away from him, curiously looking over. It almost looked like it was looking into the engine. The man chuckled to himself about the mental image of a horse mechanic and went back to the car to try to start again. Suddenly the horse spoke.

""Seems to be the carburetor,"" he said, and with those words, he took off and carried on trotting towards the sundown.

The man, too flabbergasted to say anything back in time, exited the car, carefully checked the carburetor and finally noticed something he hadn't noticed before. He fixed the car and in no time was carrying on with his journey. He still couldn't believe that a talking horse had just helped him fix his car, so he decided to stop at the nearest gas station and tell the first person he met about it.

After about 60 miles he reached the gas station and first thing he did was walk up to the gas station attendant and blurt out everything he just experienced.

The attendant was listening intently and when the man finished talking, he asked:

""Was it a white horse with a black patch on his forehead?""

""Yeah,"" said the man.

""Well then you can be glad you ran into that one. There are also a couple of those dapple gray fuckers running around giving advice and those don't know jack shit about cars.""",A man was crossing the countryside in his car.,20

They agreed that it has just gotten out of hand and that something needed to be done. Except for Rabbit, he’s been having a bit of a rough patch lately and was not happy about this whole idea at all and was the only vote against prohibition in the forest.

So next day, Lion is strolling through the forest thinking about all the possibilities their forest community now has, with everyone being sober and all … when he suddenly hears bottles clinking behind a tree. He quickly realizes what’s going on and leaps behind the tree to find Rabbit with two empty bottles of Gin. 

“WTF do you think you’re doing?!?” Lion roars at the hungover critter. Rabbit, barely able to open an eye sits himself up and drops his head and ears “Ah ffs Lion I’m so sorry, this really isn’t easy for me with Janice leaving for some asshole jackrabbit, I can’t see the kids and apparently she’s pregnant again …. It’s all such a mess…”

“Ok bruh, I hear ya, I’ll let this one-time slide …” picks Rabbit up by his ears and holds him closely to his face and slightly raises his voice again “… but remember, WE ANIMALS OF THE FOREST HAVE DECIDED ON PROHIBITION!!! If I catch you again I WILL kick you out”

Lion can’t believe his eyes when he sees Rabbit hugging a couple of bottles of whiskey in his bathtub while checking up him the next day. Lion now angry af, roars and turns on the cold showerhead.

Rabbit instantly wakes with terror in his eyes as he realizes what’s going on. Then he just brakes down in tears yells “ It’s Dave, she’s fucking fucking Dave. He’s supposed to be my best friend … “

“Ah that stinks man, but you’re putting me in a though spot here mate, I have shit to represent, I should be eating you by now.” Rabbit is just a sobbing mess at this point “ … ok, this is really the absolute last time, but you can’t tell anyone or ever drink again and if you do I WILL have to eat you!!”  
 He picks him up again by his ears to his face “WE ANIMALS OF THE FOREST HAVE DECIDED ON PROHIBITION!!!!”

Next day on his daily stroll, Lion comes along a pond where he spots some wired bubbles on its surface. He walks over to investigate, to find a bamboo stick moving around in the pond is creating those strange bubbles. He waits till it’s closer, grabs it out the water and holds it up in front of him with Rabbit holding on to it with one hand, as he’s been using it as an air straw and holding a half full bottle of Vodka in the other hand. 

 Lion screaming his head off at this point  “WE ANIMALS OF THE FOREST HAVE DECIDED ON PROHIBITION!!!!”

He turns back annoyed and sees that the hand belongs to an old bearded overweight guy.

""Why did you stop me you old fool?""

""Have you gone mad my son? You were about to kill yourself!"" The old man exclaims with a booming voice.

""I have nothing to live for anymore! Just let me end it!""

""Listen my son. I'm Santa Claus and I'm just here on vacation. But if you'd like, tell me what the problem is and maybe we can fix it."" Said the old man with genuine concern.

""OK Santa, I'll tell you"" the businessman shrugged ""I used to be a really successful businessman. I had it all, amazing cars, beautiful women, loads of money. But now I lost it all thanks to the stock market crash. So I have nothing to live for.""

""That's what got you in such melancholy? My boy, my boy! Tomorrow morning at 10, come here on this bridge and there will be a brand new Lamborghini waiting just for you!""

The businessman is surprised, then ecstatic. He grabs Santa and kisses him on both cheeks and then starts crying with joy. They sit down and talk for a while. But when they start discussing women, the businessman is depressed again.

""Oh Santa, I used to be such a playboy. Every single night I would bring home at least 2 different stunning and beautiful girls. Now, and at my age, I'll be lucky to find a mediocre girlfriend.""

""That's what got you worried? Don't pout my son. In the Lamborghini tomorrow there will be 4 beautiful women waiting for you. They are all yours!""

The man starts hugging Santa again and says

""I'm sorry Santa, maybe it's too much, but since you are doing all this for me, could you give me back at least part of my wealth? I wasn't a greedy asshole like the rest of them. I used to spend it left and right and give to charities. I just enjoyed making people happy, and I'd like that back again.""

""Sure my boy. One of the women tomorrow will have a suitcase with 1 billion dollars in it. It's all yours!""

""Oh thank you Santa, thank you so much. How could I ever repay you?""

""Well, there's one thing... I kinda miss my wife who had to stay at the North Pole, and especially... well this is embarassing... her blowjobs that she gave me every night. Would you give me a blowjob?""

The businessman is dumbfounded at first, but quickly steels himself

""Santa, you didn't just save my life, you gave it back to me as well. What you ask is the least I can do and I will gladly do it!""

""Brilliant my boy. My hotel isn't far from here. Follow me.""

Santa leads the businessman to a hotel a couple blocks away. They go into Santa's bedroom and the businessman drops to his knees, unbuckles Santa's pants and goes to work. After they finish up, the business man goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Santa leans at the door and asks:

""My boy, you never told me your name""

""I'm Alex, Santa""

""Nice to meet you Alex. Tell me, how old are you?""

""I'm nearly 50, Santa""

The cop thinks about it for a moment and says “Alright. I’m gonna have to ask you to get out of your car so I can explain it better.”

The lawyer gets out of his car and then the officer jumps on the lawyer and starts to just whoppin him. He is laying into the lawyer like nobody’s business. Gave him a black eye and a split lip before the lawyer even knew what happened.

Every time they have lunch together, he orders a ham sandwich, and spends the entire meal raving about how salty and savory and delicious it is.  Any time the rabbi so much as mentions matzo, or gefilte fish, or any other Jewish dishes, the priest is right there, piping up about how sure, that's tasty, but it's nothing compared to a good ham sandwich.

So finally, the rabbi says ""okay, since you won't stop talking about how amazing it is, I'll try a ham sandwich.  But, in return, you have to try something your religion forbids.""

And the priest thinks about it, and he agrees.  So the next day, he brings the rabbi a ham sandwich.  

The rabbi takes the sandwich, he holds it in his hands for a few seconds.  Finally he raises it to his lips, and he takes a bite. 

""See, it's good, isn't it!"" says the priest.  ""I told you were really missing out.  I bet you wish you could have these whenever you want.""

The rabbi chews thoughtfully, and then he swallows, and he nods.   ""Yes, this is a good sandwich.""

At that moment, there's a knock at the door.  ""Ah, I think it's your turn,"" says the rabbi.

The priest opens the door, and there's a gorgeous woman standing there.  She takes the priest by the hand and leads him into another room.

An hour later, the woman leaves, nodding goodbye to the rabbi, who gets up, goes over to the other room, and looks in.  The priest is lying there on the bed, half-dressed, looking dazed.

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died. ",The son of a billionaire's birthday is coming up,0

His wife, Bernice, had died a few years back to an awful illness and his kids all left the farm to pursue their dreams.

 The oldest son, Dave, became an actor and had so much success he became known far and wide to pretty much everyone in the world.

The younger son, Chet, studied to become a rocket engineer and recently landed his dream job at NASA as a rocket scientist.

 Finally, the little girl, Susie, went onto doing menial jobs straight out of high-school until she could save up enough money to start her own hair-dressing salon and quickly rose to become one of the most renowed places in the big city.

Bill was extremely proud of his children, but he still wished in his heart that at least one of them could stay with him to tend to the farm as age started taking his toll on the poor man and he couldn't handle the farm life any longer.

One day, while he was tending to his fields, Bill started to feel a sharp pain in his back and keeled over in agony, he was screaming bloody murder but nobody was around to hear him.

Luckily he had with him the phone his three children gave him when they left the farm and could call an ambulance and get taken to the closest hospital.

As soon as he gave them the news his children rushed to the hospital to visit him, they were all worried to death but he reassured them he was fine and it was just all the years of tending to the farm finally catching up to him.

The kids however were still extremely concerned and after a few minutes of talking among them they decided they couldn't let their father live alone in the farm anymore as it was too risky.

They went back inside their father's room and asked him if he'd like to sell the farm and retire, he could move into the city so that he could be closer to Susie and he wouldn't have to think about anything but relax, the kids are all successful and they'll think about every expense.

At first he was extremely reluctant, he didn't want to leave the farm where he shared so many cherished memories with Bernice and the kids, but eventually he realized he was getting too old and agreed to sell the farm.

A few days later, when the father was discharged from the hospital the kids took him to his new house in the city, it was is a nice place, right outside the city center with a beatiful garden in a very relaxing and quiet neighborhood, the perfect place for retirement; Bill was happy and for once in his life he had some time for himself.

Everything was perfect, Bill had a great place to spend his retirement, Susie was coming by every week now that they lived closer and, albeit more rarely due to their many commitments, even Dave and Chet were visiting him more.

However the peace didn't last long, a few months after he moved, Bill saw a new building site being erected on the sidewalk right in front of his house, curious he tried to ask the workers what they were building, they said they had no idea, it was a new project made by the city council and they knew nothing about its purpose.

A few weeks later the job was done and the building crew left the site, what ended up being there was a huge pole, not unlike a lamp-post, albeit missing the light bulb, in it's place however there was this huge ball with a hole going thorough it.

Bill was dumbfounded and he could not understand what this huge pole was for.

Later that night, as he was about to fall asleep he started hearing a sound coming from outside, at first it was a faint, undiscernible sound but eventually it started getting very loud, it was something like a high pitched ""RRRRRREEEEEEEE"" worried he rushed outside to find the source of all that noise and realized it was coming from the huge pole that was installed the day prior, as it just so happened the wind blowing through the hole on top of the pole emitted the infamous screeching sound.

The farmer, still perplexed went back to bed and decided he'd try to ask Susie next morning, however the wind didn't stop all night and he couldn't catch a single blink.

The following morning he gave Susie a call and asked if she would come to see the strange pole in front of his house, maybe she knew something about it, Susie came and inspected the object, but she had no idea either what that was for, however she remembered that Chet would come to visit that weekend and said that he would most likely know something about it, since he's always been very smart.

Bill spent a whole week sleeping very little as every night the wind would blow inside the weird structure and emit it's high pitched ""RRRRRREEEEEEE"" sound.

Finally that weekend Chet came to visit and found his father in a very bad shape due to lack of sleep, Bill had told him before about the weird lamp post in front of his house in one of their phone calls but Chet couldn't understand what it was and said he'd most likely be able to figure it out if he could study the object, after all he was a smart and confident man.

Chet looked at the pole, studied it, tried to think about its purpose for the whole weekend but couldn't find an answer, defeated he told his father he was sorry he couldn't figure it out but said he'd try to get Dave to visit, Dave was an actor and travelled all over the world to shoot movies, he had seen a lot of things in his travels and he surely had seen something similar before.

As it just so happen, Dave would finish shooting for his new movie in 3 weeks and he was extremely happy to go back to visit his father.

Another 3 weeks passed, unfortunately for poor Bill, the wind blew incessantly every single night, and every single night he was kept awake by the disgusting ""REEEEEE"" sound coming from it.

When Dave came, he found his father on the brink of madness, he was trembling, paranoid, a shell of his former self, without any further ado he asked Bill to show him the post.

So Bill took him to the pole, Dave looked at it, turned to his father and said.

""Ah yes, I've seen it before! It's a re-post""

Writer's note: I'm so sorry.",Bill was a farmer...,162

Always has been, and for generations it seemed like he always would be. One afternoon, however, after a particularly poorly received watering hole decision, the elephant had had enough. 

“Lion,” he said, “I’ve been your major domo for as long as you’ve been alive, and my pop worked with your pop, and his pop before him. For as long as I can remember, the elephants have been the brains of this operation, and I can remember a great deal. I think it’s time for a change.”

“Elephant, don’t be foolish,” says the lion, “the lion has always been the king. Always has been, always will be.”

“Well, I’ve got some of the animals rallied, and they disagree. We’re fixing to stage a coup if you don’t start taking our demands seriously.”

The lion is rightfully alarmed. He asks the elephant what he’s proposing. 

“A game of skill. Whichever of us is the victor, that animal will be the new king.”

“I propose football,” says the lion, “we’ll draft the animal kingdom using our wit, command them on the field with our leadership, and demonstrate our respective strengths.”

The elephant readily agrees. The lion has the first pick as the reigning regent, and selects the cheetah, an obvious speed threat on the field. The elephant rebuts with the hippo, a tough defender. The draft continues, from the chimp to the gazelle and all the way down to the humblest of the animals. Then, the day of the big game arrives. 

The lion receives the kickoff. He leads his team on a long drive down the field as the quarterback, shucking and jiving, outthinking the opposing defense. He scores a touchdown!

The donkey is kicking off for the lion, and shoots a laser down the field. In a flash, the rhino has the ball, and marches down the field. He’s unstoppable! He plows past the twenty, thirty, forty, midfield, and all the way into the lion’s end zone. It’s a tie game, all on the one play!

The lion grumbles, but takes the ball once more and leads his team on another successful drive. 

“Donkey,” he says, “kick the ball wherever you’d like, but don’t kick it to that damn rhino.”

“You got it boss,” he says. 

He reared back his big kicking leg, smashes the ball, and it lands straight in the rhino’s waiting hands. Once more, he charges down the field, slamming through the animals, and scores a touchdown.

The game proceeds. The lion will score on a drive down the field, and the rhino invalidates all his hard work, the elephant laughing on the sidelines. It’s a tie game, fourth quarter, and because of a missed field goal, the lion leads by one point. There’s only enough time on the clock for a kickoff. 

“Donkey,” the lion says, “if you kick the ball to that goddamn rhino one more time, I’ll make my last act as king a donkey feast for the rest of the animals.”

The donkey gulps and says, “you got it boss.”

He rears back. He kicks. The ball goes flying. Wouldn’t you know it, it lands in the arms of the rhinoceros. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, midfield…

Forty

Thirty

Twenty

Ten

The rhino trips! He loses the ball! The lion pounces atop it, and his team are the victors!

Amidst the celebrations, the lion realizes his good luck. He goes to inspect the field at the point where the rhino, so dominant all game, tripped. There, battered but very much alive, he notices a tiny centipede. 

“Did you trip him?” Asked the lion. 

“Yessir,” said the centipede.

“If you could have done that the whole time, why wait until the final seconds of the game? Why make me so nervous?”

“Oh, I was tying my shoes.”

The guy says, ""well I sold him a fishing boat, a trailer, a truck, bait, gear, sonar equipment, the works.""

The boss is incredulous, ""so he came in to buy a boat and you sold him a car and all the associated gear available?""

The guy replies, ""No sir, he came in to buy a pack of tampons, and I said well seeing as your weekends fucked, you might as well go fishing.""",Life of a salesman,21

“It's my understanding that the first six probes were recklessly plunged into Uranus at such excessively high speeds these early attempts only produced massively dense clouds of methane gas that erupted from Uranus almost on contact with each probe, and these so completely obscured everything that no one was really able to see anything clearly. In fact, it became so frustrating some very famous PhDs openly began saying they found even thinking about Uranus was starting to keep them up at night.

At first it was decided Uranus had so badly damaged the first six probes they tried to use on it, and the gas that kept erupting from Uranus was said to be so noxious, that the CDC actually initially discussed simply designating Uranus unfit for all future human contact.

But then the seventh probe attempt, which you might say was almost ‘eased’ into Uranus by an unlikely group of burly-looking, grinning Russians with fat fingers, finally worked! That last probe being so much larger and moving so much, much slower as it entered Uranus than the first six had, it gave us all an all too brief, but crystal clear, slow-motion picture that came into focus just as a massive, and unbelievably thick, brownish-orange, and oddly lumpy, ring of debris, completely circling Uranus, slid into view, and we all agreed it simply took our breath away when we first saw it. In fact, the tension was so palpable in the room I was watching it in as the pale blue, almost bruised looking picture of Uranus first slid into the frame, everyone gasped. In fact, many near the front of the room were said to be openly and emotionally sobbing afterward at a view of Uranus that frankly no one was prepared for…”",Uranus ( long ),5

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""

post,9aj0lq,2qh72,jokes,false,1535317733,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9aj0lq/billy_loves_trolleys/,self.jokes,,"When Billy was 5, he found that he loves trolleys. Every day he would bring his toy trolley to school and play with it at every chance he got. He became known as The Trolley Kid. Now, a 5 year old liking trolleys is kinda strange, so strange in fact that Billy was bullied by most of the kids. Most kids would laugh at him for liking trolleys, they’d ignore him or leave him out of their groups, causing Billy to have no friends outside of his toy trolley. But that didn’t bother him in the slightest, he still has his toy trolley to keep him company. However, there was one bully, the worst out of the bunch, Steve. Steve had it out for Billy for some reason, every chance he got he would torment him, but that didn’t stop Billy from liking trolleys or bringing in his toy trolley. One day during lunch, Billy was minding his own business playing with his toy trolley. Steve decided that it was time to pull off the worst act of bullying to Billy, Steve wanted to break the trolley. So he did, Steve ripped the trolley out of Billy’s hands and threw it against the wall. The toy didn’t survive the impact, it split right in two. One would think Billy would be devastated by this loss, but Billy wasn’t sad or crying. Rather, Billy was enraged, blood was boiling, and as though a switch was flipped, the normally quiet Billy tackled Steve to the ground and began punching Steve. As with all illogical stories, the school expelled Billy and only suspended Steve, forcing Billy to be homeschooled up until he went into university.

One would think Billy would outgrow his love for trolleys, but no, the place in his heart for trolleys only grew as time went on. Upon finishing his homeschooling, Billy decided to drive trolleys for a living. As a result of being mostly homeschooled, Billy struggled to make friends in university. He mostly kept to himself, used his love for trolleys as emotional support, and graduated without any problems. Now, the job market for trolley conductors isn’t competitive at all, but there were no openings for when Billy applied. But, for the sake of the story, the company decided to give Billy an interview. Billy expressed his enthusiasm for trolleys, how he always dreamed of driving one and how he commited his time in university solely on being able to be in charge of his very own trolley. The interviewer was so impressed by Billy’s story that he guaranteed Billy a position once one was available. Billy was saddened by not being given a job immediately, but nonetheless he was ecstatic that he was one step closer to fulfilling his dreams. He did some odd jobs in retail, fast food, and other minimum wage jobs just to get by, all while waiting to receive the call for his dream job. 

Eventually, Billy’s patience paid of, he got a call informing him a position was available and they would love for him to work under them. Finally, Billy could drive his very own trolley. He was one of the youngest people driving trolleys, and quickly became the favorites of many of his passengers due to his enthusiasm while driving. However, this happy story is not without its downs. One day, a brand new casino was opening in town, and it was right in the middle of Billy’s route. With his regulars with him, Billy passed by the casino. The casino was full of people, so much in fact it had a large line wrapping around the entire block. People were excited, they were laughing and enjoying themselves. However, all the noise and partying brought back traumatizing memories for Billy. He remembered Steve, how he was enraged when his trolley broke, how his blood boiled at the moment. Just like his toy trolley, Billy snapped. He drove his trolley straight into the casino, causing the deaths of nearly a hundred people. Billy wasn’t going to be let off with a simple expulsion this time. He was sentenced to death by electric chair. 

In his cell, Billy was offered his final meal. Billy told the guard he wanted a medium rare steak, a glass of wine, and two blue apples from the Amazon. Now, the first two items on this list were easy to acquire, but the two blue apples had to be directly found from the Amazon so Billy had to wait 2 months before his scheduled execution. Upon receiving his meal however, he found that the steak and wine combo tasted wonderfully, but not as wonderful as the appearance of a trolley. However, when Billy tasted the blue apples, the blue apples quickly found a place in his heart, larger than his love for his parents, but not larger than his love for trolleys. When Billy finished his meal, he was placed in the chair. Billy was asked for his last words, and all he could muster was an apology for his parents. The switch was flipped, electricity was sent through Billy’s body. Miraculously, Billy survived, because they couldn’t sentence him for the same crime twice, he was let go.

Now, Billy knew no one would hire him after this event, so he moved to England and threw away his identity as Billy the Trolley lover. While he still loved trolleys, he changed his name to James and hid his love for them. It was difficult for James, he couldn’t use his credentials from university as his future employers would know he was responsible for driving a trolley into a casino. So James worked some odd jobs in town, such as working as a garbage collector, mascot for some stores, even doing some gardening for the elderly in his new neighborhood. Eventually, after getting involved in the community, James applied to become a bus driver, as that was very similar to a trolley and would allow him to secretly express his love despite the differences. Life was relatively quiet for a few years with no incidents reminding James of his experience with Steve. However, construction on a brand new mall had just finished. People were flocking towards the grand opening. So many people in fact that there were lines of people for several blocks just trying to get in, causing James’s bus route to be blocked off. There were so many festivities and people laughing that it reminded James of his time in school. Thinking back to all the children laughing and ignoring him, especially Steve, James snapped just like his toy trolley. His blood began to boil, he became enraged, and drove his bus straight into the lines of people on the street. Just like last time, James was sentenced to the electric chair. 

James was offered a final meal before his scheduled death. James took that offer and ordered a medium rare steak, a glass of wine, and two blue apples, remembering the vivid taste the last time he went through this. This time, the town actually imported blue apples from the Amazon so Billy was able to eat his meal on time for his execution. The steak and the wine were of lower quality and weren’t as tasty as last time, but the two blue apples exceeded James’s imagination. It was better than he remembered, so much better that his love for them was nearly the same as his love for trolleys, but trolleys remained number one in his heart. And so, James’s time on earth neared its end once again. He sat down on the chair and let the executioner strap him in. When asked for his final words, James apologized to his parents again. The switch was flipped, electricity was sent through James’s body. Once again, James survived. 

The executioner realized something was up, only one other person has asked for blue apples for their final meal, he asked James “You’re that trolley guy. Billy, the man who rammed into a casino? I could tell because of the blue apples. Tell me, what let you survive? Was it the steak? The wine? The blue apples?”

James was unsure of how to answer, for he himself did not know how he survived. So he replied “I guess I’m just a bad conductor.”

He was in the middle of nowhere, and there were no motels, rest stops, or truck stops.
After what seemed like hours and hours of combing the road, he finds an abandoned house. It was two stories, had an overgrown lawn, and all the windows on the first story were boarded up. It was better than nothing.
He pulled up in the gravel driveway and walked up to the door, and gave it a few knocks.
“Hello?” He called, but no one answered. He tried the door knob. The door let out a creak and opened.
“Hello?”
No response.
After seeing that no one was home, he noticed an old staircase, and walked up it. It led to a bedroom, covered in dust. It had a queen sized bed, which seemed very clean, it was made and the sheets were fresh. So he laid down on the bed to finally get some sleep.
After what felt like just dozing off, he heard a thud outside. He looked out the window, and saw a coffin, made of cedar. It was about six feet tall, and had a black cross burned on it. Passing it off as a hallucination, the truck driver went back to bed. A couple minutes later, he heard another thud. The coffin looked like it had moved. Passing it off as just sleep deprivation, he went back to bed.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
Again, once more, the trucker looked out the window. It had definitely moved.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
It hopped up and down right before his very eyes.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
It was almost to the doorstep. He ran down the stairs and looked right out of the peephole in the door.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
It was at the door. The trucker ran up the stairs, and right at that moment, the coffin crashed through the door. The man slammed the door to the bedroom and began piling up furniture around it. It surely couldn’t even get up the stairs, he thought.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
But it did.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
It stopped for a moment. Bracing for the worst, the trucker ran to the back corner of the room and stared at the door.
Crash!
It broke through the door like a hot knife through butter.
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
He threw his pocketknife, his keys, his wallet, but the coffin kept hopping closer. Soon, it was less than a yard away from him. As a last attempt, he threw a Halls cough drop at it, and the coffin stopped.",There was a man from New York that was driving his rig through the Midwest,51

“You guys ever try 9/11? Not the greatest, let me tell you-”

Six months later, still on crutches, the comedian finds the guy who wrote his jokes.

Two or three times a week this happens. After a month or so he notices the envelopes start to look a bit shabby and he starts to suspect that it is the same letter being posted over and over again. 

The postman thinks this is very strange and brings it up with his colleagues at the depot one day and that he is thinking of asking the residents what the deal is. His colleague tells him that people can be a bit sensitive when it comes to their post so he had better be sure he is correct about it being the same letter first.

So the next Friday before he posts the letter he puts a small pencile dot on the envelope and puts it through the letter box. Sure enough the following Monday he pulls the letter out of his bag and there it is complete with small pencile dot. Finally he can't resist anymore so this time he knocks on the door. 

A woman opens and he says ""Sorry to disturb you madam but I just have to ask. Why do you keep receiving the same letter over and over again?""

He spends many years constructing a large house from the islands native trees, until one day he decides to go and explore the island.

&amp;#x200B;

He walks through the dense bush of the island and finds nothing on interest, just as he is about to walk back to his large house he hears a rustling in the bushes behind him. He whips around and sees a creature about a meter long and wide, pink in color with large poofy hair, and massive teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

He stops and remains completely still and watches the creature, when suddenly another one falls from a tree right next to it, landing beside it. Then another one falls from the same tree and all three of them stand side by side for a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while the creatures form a circle and start rotating. The man is confused by this ritual, but still remains completely still incase they turn out to be aggressive in any way. abruptly the earth begins to shake, and another one of the animals, only a foot wide and long, slowly rises out of the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The animals wander off into the forest, and the man terrified and confused stumbles back to his house, and sits down on a chair on his porch. 

&amp;#x200B;

As he sits in his chair, he decides to come up with a name for these creatures. He decides on ""Poom"" as ""Po"" means pink in his language, and ""Om"" means large. 

&amp;#x200B;

The man sits in the chair, contemplating the incident, until he decides to go to bed. The next morning he wakes up to strange sounds from the sea surrounding his island. He runs out to see a massive steamship flying the union jack snapped in two in the water, with bodies floating limp around it. He runs down to to beach to try and save people, but finds nobody left alive.

&amp;#x200B;

As he searches the boat for people, he comes across an english dictionary, taking it home with him he decides to read it so he can communicate with any surviving crew he could find. wanting to be away from the creaking and groaning of the destroyed ship, he descends into the forest, reading the book for hours, until he feels he has a basic grasp of the language.

&amp;#x200B;

He heads back to his house only to notice something through the window, a ""Poom"" is pushed up against the window of his bedroom, more are on his balcony, and a half dozen sit on the roof. He starts to panic when he spots one of the crew from the english ship hiding in the bush in front of him, carrying a rifle.

The schoolchildren were learning vocabulary, specifically the word ‘tragedy’, when the famous businessman stormed into the classroom.
Trump decided to help the children learn the word ‘tragedy’, and asked the following question to them:
“What would be a tragedy, kids?”
A bespectacled boy nervously answers:
“If my best friend died of pneumonia, that would be a tragedy.”
“No, that would be a great loss,” Trump corrects him.
Another shy young child answers:
“If my uncle got hit by a train, that would be a tragedy.”
“No, no, that would be an accident,” Trump replies.
A young girl raises her hand. The wealthy businessman asks her if she’d like to give an example of a tragedy. The girl nods, and says:
“If Mr. Trump was in his private jet, and a missile hit the jet, that would be a tragedy.”
“Yes, that would be a tragedy for sure. Can you tell me why?” The businessman asks.
“Well, it definitely wasn’t a great loss, and I’m not sure if it was an accident, either,”

""Hi, Jamie."" The president says, much to the confusion of a Secret Service Agent. The agent asks how Trump knew her only to be replied with ""Everyone knows Jamie Kelly."" 

So the agent brings Jamie to England via Air Force One. He shoves her into Buckingham Palace. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle pass by and say ""Hey Jamie how's it going?"" 

The agent finds out and takes Jamie, Prince Harry, and Meghan to Springfield and shoves them into 742 Evergreen Terrence. They land in Bart Simpson's room where he screams ""HEY JAMIE, HEY HARRY, HEY MEGAN!"" and all of the other Simpsons family members enter. They wave to Jamie, Prince Harry, and Meghan.

So the agent brings them all to Texas and drops them on some propane tanks. A boy trying to play soccer sees them and says ""Hi Jamie, Prince Harry, Meghan, Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie."" Which they respond with "" Hey Bobby"" (except for Maggie because she's a baby).

The agent finds out and brings them....er...what should I call them...oh, yeah, The Famous Gang to Seattle. Unfortunately, the land in the middle of an episode of iCarly. Obviously, Carly and Sam recognize them.

So the agent brings The Famous Gang, now containing Sam and Carly, back to the White House. He shows them to Trump, only to be replied with, ""WHO THE FUCK ARE THOSE PEOPLE!?""
