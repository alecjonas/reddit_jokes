He moved to another spot, and again, the ground was too solid to dig. No matter where he moved in the newly donated land, he couldn't carve out so much as a golf hole.

post,9nqfug,2qh72,jokes,false,1539398015,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9nqfug/the_kingdom_of_the_ogre/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, an evil ogre ruled over the land of the Trids.  Most of the time he left his subjects alone, and even managed the kingdom quite well, and times were prosperous.  But once a week, he would come down from his hilltop castle and spend an hour *kicking* every Trid he saw.  Doesn’t matter if it was an old man or a young girl, he’d run right up and kick them.  Then he’d laugh his evil laugh, and trot off to find his next victim.  When he had had his fill, he’d saunter back up to the castle with a very self-satisfied look on his face.

The Trids were understandably disturbed and bewildered by this treatment, and one day, after a particularly vicious round of kicking, they held a town meeting to decide what to do. They knew they could never overpower the ogre, so they decided they would try to reason with him. They needed to find the wisest man in the land to put together the best possible arguments, and they agreed the local rabbi was the right choice. They went to him and asked if he could figure out a way to convince the ogre to stop kicking them.

“Tricky,” the rabbi said. 

“But can you do it?” the Trids asked.

“Well, I’ll see what I can do,” the rabbi replied. 

So the rabbi spent the next week studying every book he could find about ogres, the history of the Trids, and even ways to exercise that would be better than kicking people.  He worked late every night to put together the best collection of argument he could muster, including memorizing loads of evidence and examples to back up every single point.

Finally, just hours before the ogre’s next kicking session, the rabbi was ready.  He marched bravely up to the castle gate and asked for entry.  The ogre was feeling generous that afternoon, so he allowed the rabbi to see him.

The rabbi asked, “I presume you are about to go out and kick my fellow Trids?”

“Yes, and I’m feeling very energetic today!  I’m going to do a *lot* of kicking this evening!” the ogre said excitedly.

“Well, we would respectfully ask you to reconsider,” the rabbi said, and then began his argument.

The ogre listened for several minutes.  At first he seemed to be interested in the rabbi’s points, and even asked a few questions, which the rabbi enthusiastically answered. But as time passed, the ogre seemed increasingly impatient.  Just as the rabbi was in the middle of his best, most passionate final argument, the ogre suddenly raised his hand.  The rabbi stopped mid-sentence.  The ogre stared at him for several seconds.

“Don’t you understand?” asked the ogre. 

“Uhh... no?” replied the rabbi. 

The ogre rolled his eyes. 

“Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids!”

His friend Koala always invites him out to a lunch at a restaurant after a long and arduous day at the zoo, but because he is allergic to most foods, he cannot eat anything and must watch Koala eat his own food jealously.

After almost two years of this, he exclaims in sadness to his Koala friend: ""Man I hate having to watch you eat all the time, while I can only drink water!""

Koala replies ""There's nothing much you can do, as you're allergic to pretty much every single food out there"".

Devastated, he returns home, but comes up with a brilliant idea. Why not start a company that creates packed lunches for animals like him who are allergic to most foods?

He works on this idea for months, creating a company that is extremely successful that earns him a lot of money from sales from animals like him. Unfortunately, even after all this time, he has not created a name for the business yet, and has found every single name suggested horrible.

But, at the same time, he is now finally happy that he can have a lunch to eat with the Koala, and no longer has to feel bad about having to watch Koala eat all the time.

Back at the zoo, Koala asks ""Hey, how's your business doing?"", to which Alpaca replies ""It's going pretty well, but I still haven't been able to find a name yet"".

Koala nods sympathetically, and suggests ""How about we go out for lunch?""

""What a great idea Koala!"", Alpaca replies. ""Alpaca Lunch!""",An alpaca is allergic to almost all foods...,3

At the Baptist church, the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.  


The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist Church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.  


But the Catholic church came up with a very creative strategy. They baptized all the squirrel's &amp; made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

&gt;Thank you. Your mother-in-law who loves you. 

Next week, she went for a walk with the second one and on the edge of the same lake slides again, falls and begins to drown.

The guy jumps into the water in an instant and rescues her too. Next day he finds a Chevrolet Spark parked outside the house with the following note:

&gt;Thank you. Your mother-in-law who loves you. 

Once again, now with the third son-in-law, and again on the same lake, same edge, slides, falls, and begins to drown. The guy, looks at her, laughs and says:

At least! stupid old women, I've been waiting years for this!

And she's gone.

However, next day he also finds a car parked right in front of his lawn, a brand new Mercedes-AMG S65 Coupe, also with an attached message:

&gt;Thank you. Your father-in-law who loves you.",Lovely Mother-in-law,27

post,9nnyq5,2qh72,jokes,false,1539377353,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9nnyq5/the_talking_bird/,self.jokes,,"Alright, so there is this guy that I am friends with who's job has been sending him away on business trips lately.  He is away from home for sometimes 4-5 days at a time.  He is married.  No kids.  This wife of his, well, she is super fuckin' hot.  Like, she is at least a 9/10 and she knows it too.  You should see the way she flaunts herself around sometimes.  It is crazy.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after a while this dude starts to think ""a babe like that, and with me being away so often... I wonder if she is cheating on me?""  Now, this was back in the early 80s, and security cameras were not nearly as affordable as they are today.  He wanted one that he could hide while he is away, but he just couldn't afford one.

&amp;#x200B;

One night he and I were chillin' at the bar and having a few drinks.  He tells me about his potential problem, but that he doesn't know how to know what goes on at his house when he isn't around.  Then it hit me.  ""Dude, you need to get a parrot and teach it to talk.  That way the bird can tell you what it saw when you get back from your business trips!"" Damn, that was a good idea.  Sometimes I come up with the most genius shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day this guy is at the pet store.  He tells the shop owner that he would like a parrot.  The shop owner got a bit of a frown.  ""The only one I have... well, I don't think you want it"" he stated.  ""Why not?"" asked my buddy.  The shop owner takes him over to a bird cage and removes the cover. Get this... this bird had no legs!  My friend asked ""well how does it stay on it's perch?""  The shop owner tells him that the only way for the bird to do that is if you wrap it's dick around the perch.  The bird was used to this, and balanced on there pretty good with just it's big dong. ""What?!"" you must be asking. ""You cant be serious"".  I am totally serious about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my man has this parrot at his house.  It took a while, but he taught the thing how to talk.  Once the training was done, this bird had a pretty good handle on the English language.  A few days later, my buddy is again away on a business trip.  When he cam back, he asked the bird if any men came to the house.

&amp;#x200B;

""First day, mailman came.  He gave lady the mail."" the bird said before giving out a squawk.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ok Bernard (that is what he named the bird.  pretty stupid name for a bird if you ask me), then what happened the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

""Mailman came and gave lady the mail.  The two of them chatted for a few minutes and then she rubbed her hand across his chest.  That is all.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ok Bernard, then how about the next day?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Mailman came.  Lady and mailman took off each others clothes.  They were licking each others tongues.  Lady laid down on the couch mailman put his head between her legs.""

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy started to get pissed.  ""Bernard, then what happened?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Mailman lay down on couch.  Lady got on top of him and bounced around.  Her boobs were shaking up and down"" Bernard said, before going silent.

&amp;#x200B;

My dude asks the bird ""and then what?"".

&amp;#x200B;

The bird didn't say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

""Bernard, tell me.""

&amp;#x200B;

Bernard looked at him right in the eye, paused for a moment, and then shouted ""I FELL OFF MY FUCKING PERCH!""",The Talking Bird,5

The bartender says “I make 500$ a week off that table. What the fuck?” 

The man says “I’m sorry, here’s a check for 500$, I’ll be back in a week with your ball.”

The following week, the man shows up again with a paper bag and his monkey. He sets the bag on the table and declares “Here’s your ball, I’m truly sorry for the inconvenience.”

The bartender says, “ I already bought a new ball, so I’m grateful you returned the ball, but let me get you a drink on the house. Can I get anything for the monkey as well?”
 
The man responds “Sure, I’ll have a beer, and the monkey would be delighted to have some grapes if you’ve got them.”
 
The bartender serves the beer and places a bowl of grapes on the bar.

The monkey climbs onto the bar, picks up a grape, sniffs it, sticks it in his ass, pulls it back out and eats it. Then repeats the process.

The bartender points at the monkey and says “what the fuck is this?”

The second man, even more wrinkled and without even one strain of hair, laughs out loud and replies with a slight chuckle:
&gt;""What a fool you have been, wasting all that time. I have reached my monumental age of 102 through abstinence and a strict diet of soy beans and water. I may have missed out on feasting but it was certainly worthwhile.""

Suddenly a third man appears. He is wrinkled to the point of having his eyes hidden under thick flaps of skin. Leaning on his big walking stick he unleashes a neighing, hardly recognizable as a laugh and begins to speak in a slow, grainy voice:
&gt;""You both have wasted your life! I have for my whole life taken every kind of drug there is. I have slept with uncountable amounts of women. I have smoked three packs of cigarettes on every day of my life. I drank as much beer as I could. Yet, I still live after all these years and that with all the pleasure I could accumulate. You both have wasted your time.""

The other two men are visibly astounded and quickly ask in Unison:
&gt;""For how long have you lived? It is obvious that you must be older than the both of us.""

The third man smiles and answers:

Before they could say no, the man says “ how about this, after I start I’ll drop your money on the ground and by the time it hits the floor I’ll be finished.

The next day, the boyfriend pulls up to the mans house to drop his girlfriend off. She says “ stay parked here, I should be right back out.” And she heads inside. Almost a full hour goes by before she comes out and gets back in the car..”what the hell took so long??” The boyfriend asked.

He didn't go before because he didn't have money and his wife couldn't support their family well enough if she were to help him pay.

""I'm really sorry John"", mumbled Ashley as she sobbed.

John's infection got so much worse that his limbs above the torso had to be amputated. Having a lack of a pair of essential limbs had led him to a state of depression, and his children were very judgemental and afraid and traumatized by the sudden change in appearance to the man they once called father.

Ashley left with the kids to stay at her mom's as she didn't want the children to be further hurting John's feelings, knowing well how depressed he already is. All alone, John had to resort to drugs that him and his buddies shared. Coke, meth and other named and no-named drugs were spread across John's house and messy was just an understatement. John suddenly realized what kind of a mess he's in, and he decided that he should do something about it. 

John and his buddies were all part of this huge gang in the uptown part of the state( yes he's still poor ), and thus had access to weapons. They had the grandest idea to rob a bank. Of course, all of his buddies planned meticulously and went to the bank the next evening. But unforseen circumstances led to his buddies dying due to the police arriving and gunning them down. All but John. One of the men aimed their guns at John, when another shouted ""don't shoot"".

Second, the man wishes for the most expensive sports car collection in the world so that he can drive around the island in style. Again, the genie works his magic and grants the second wish. 

For his last wish, the man wishes for a bridge to connect his island to the rest of the world. After some thinking, the genie tells the man that building a bridge that long is not possible and he must come up with another wish. Somewhat disappointed, the man thinks of something else he can wish for. 

Feeling lonely, the man uses his final wish to ask for a woman who is beautiful, perfect for him in every way, a great lover and will always love him. The genie thinks long and hard about the man’s third wish but sighs and asks the man what color he’d like his bridge. ",A man is stranded on an island when he comes across a genie in a bottle,5

Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries. Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. In conclusion, if it hadn't been for Joe with his cotton eye, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go?

So I am taking a calculus class with Professor Belski my freshman year of college. Intentionally choosing this professor solely because my older sister just aced his calculus class last year.

After much negotiation, bargaining and begging, she said ""come back in 30minutes, I need to find it"" 

Following instruction, I came back 30 minutes later and she hands me her clean book then a ziploc bag full of crumpled colored paper. I screamed, ""What The Fuck Belanie? I needed the notes an..."" 
""Aaannd What?!"" she replied.
""Fine, you know what? Even though I know how much time and effort will go into it, even though I know you will get know credit off of your work, and even though I could just do my own work &amp; study those notes... You are forcing me.. I'll find the right place, in time and RE-POST-IT!""

Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries. Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. In conclusion, if it hadn't been for Joe with his cotton eye, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go?

Now, the Cool Clam Club was known across the seven seas as one of the most prestigious clubs known to seakind due to the fact that their initiation was quite possibly the most dangerous stunt you could pull; however, if you passed, you got a really sharp looking leather jacket with a clam patch on the back. Everyone wanted to be in the Cool Clam Club. 


Three clams decided they would try their shell at joining the Cool Clam Club. Their names were Justin, Travis, and Griffin. They all knew the initiation was difficult, but they've been watching from the sidelines for far too long. What is this tough initiation you may ask?


Every day at around sunfall the tide would rise. The rising tide would cause the old wooden dock to rise up for a few moments, then come crashing down back into the shore. To join the Cool Clam Club, a clam must take a running start, slide under one of the large wooden legs of the dock, and come out the other side unscathed. 


""Simple,"" thought all three clams. They had seen this initiation many times before, they knew the techniques and the wet and wild stunts. 


The Justin clam went first. He observed the rising and falling of the post. He took a deep swig of water. He towards his destiny.


*WOOSH!*


The Cool Clam Club received the Justin clam with open arms. He passed initiation and the leather jacket was his! Surely, he must be the coolest clam in town!


Travis clam, upon seeing his fellow clam claim the jacket, was happy. But he knew that he was next. The dock rose, it fell, it rose...


*WOOSH!*


The Travis clam had made it! He hugged the Justin clam, cheers erupted around him, and the jacket was his. 


Griffin looked at the two other clams on the other side of that large wooden post. He was getting nervous. His tiny stomach began to hurt out of nervousness. Alas! If Justin and Travis had made it through, surely he could make it as well!


The Griffin clam backed up to get a head start. He looked at the dock, nervous still. The Cool Clam Club looked on with interest at this. They all clenched the lapels of their cool leather jackets, for they all wanted the littlest clam to join their ranks.


The Griffin clam looked at the dock. The large wooden pillar rose. It fell. It rose...


*SPLAT!*


The post fell upon the Griffin clam and the littlest clam was no more. 


Now, my friends, you may be wondering what killed the Griffin clam. The other two clams had made it through without a scratch, so then, why did the Griffin clam fail?


Pier pressure.

A man walks into a bar with an alligator  under his arm. Immediately the bartender shouts at  the guy to “Get that dangerous beast out of the bar. It’s scaring the other customers away!”  

The man answers, .~~ Sir, I’ll have you know this gator is the most gentle creature on earth. If you would please allow me to demonstrate. And with that the man opens the gators mouth and puts his penis in it.  The man has a drink, some conversation then, after 15 minutes he puts his dick back in his pants and closes the gators mouth, unscathed, intact. Everyone is totally amazed.

He then turns around and holds up $1,000 cash challenging the patrons to do what he just did. No one took him up in it. Turning his attention back to the proprietor they talk about just how gentle the monster really is. About 10 minutes later a gay guy walks up to him and said “You know, I considered accepting your challenge.”  “Really? Why didn’t you then?”asked the Gators owner. Said the gay guy...”I honestly didn’t think I would be able to keep my mouth open for that long.”",Open wide,4

After extensive scans and tests the doctor calls him in and gives him the bad news. 
""I'm very sorry sir, you have a very rare case in which your nuts press up against the base of your spine which, in turn, is causing you these headaches.""

So the man asks what can be done, and the doctor responds regretfully that the only solution he can think of is to cut off his balls. 

The man is understandably upset but decides that there is nothing to be done and he can't live with these headaches any longer and so they schedule the surgery. 
The day of the surgery arrives, and everything goes smoothly. 

In recovery, the doctor sees the man is very depressed his jewels are gone for good and goes up to him to try and cheer him up. 
""You know, just outside the hospital there is a very good tailer, why don't you give him a visit and get yourself some new clothes to feel better?""

The guy agrees that this might make him feel a little better and after getting discharged walks into this little tailor shop next to the hospital. 

As he walks in he hears, ""size 7 hat!""

Looking around he spots a diminutive old man in a tweed vest peering at him. 
""What did you say?"" asks the man. 

""I said size 7 hat, that is your hat size, no?"" answered the tailor. 

""Well I don't know, I was never really a hat man, how did you know?""

""I have been doing this for 55 years. I can look at someone for a few seconds and tell you all their measurements!""

The man, disbelieving, decides to put this claim to the test. ""Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?""
""42,"" came the prompt response. 

""Shirt size?""
""18.""

'Incredible,' thinks the man, 'this guy is good!'
""What about my pants size?""
""44,"" came the answer.

Read through, not only the punchline is different, you should be able to notice the other subtle changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-known porn star, and the other is a lazy ass. Lazy ass doesn't have a job and just likes to sit around the house. One Sunday, the porn star is angry and thirsty. He decides to make the brother do something useful. He tells him to get off his lazy ass and go get them something to drink. After some objection, the lazy brother takes the motor bike and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the porn star dozes off on his day off. He puts his phone on silent so he won't be disturbed.

&amp;#x200B;

About 45 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a rear-end collision in the T-junction by the liquor store. His pulse rate is slowing down; he's in a comma and paralyzed. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the ER under observation, but his condition is unfavourable. They try calling his porn star brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is on silent.

&amp;#x200B;

The porn star wakes to a bang on the door. Suspecting a legal representative, he ignores it, but the banging continues. Eventually, he decides to get up and scream at the person at the door. When he does, he discloses -----the Angel of Death. He is just as he appears in movies; a full fleshed face underneath a frayed cloak.

&amp;#x200B;

The Angel of Death. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".

&amp;#x200B;

""What do you mean?"" asks the pornt star.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a hazardous car accident, and I've come to take him to hell. I'm afraid his time on Earth is finished. I'll take my leave now.""

&amp;#x200B;

The porns tar appears upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my bro's life? After all, YOU made the error. Surely there must be a way I can negotiate for his life.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Angel of Death asks ""What do you have in mind?""

&amp;#x200B;

The porn star thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Angel of Death laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you suggest?""

&amp;#x200B;

The porn star smiles. ""I suggest we see who can ejaculate the furthest. 2 minutes of masturbating, each, then we decide.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Very well"" says the Angel of Death, who steps away from the porn star keeping a distance of 5 meters between the two, still facing each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Once there, he pulls back his frayed cloak to reveal his 15 inch penis. It's long and thick. He takes his hand, spits on it, and starts masturbating. After 2 minutes, the strongest, slimiest ball of semen projectiles from his penis towards the porn star and lands 1 meter in front of the porn star. The Angel of Death smirks. ""You are silly human. But, you are granted your chance.""

&amp;#x200B;

The porn star takes out his 12 inch penis, wraps in hand around it, and starts masturbating like a crazy man. When his 2 minutes are up, he ejaculates.

&amp;#x200B;

It's beyond belief.

&amp;#x200B;

A stream of semen projectiles from porn star's penis so fast and far, that a bit of his semen lands right at the feet of Angel of Death, millimeters away.

&amp;#x200B;

The winner is obvious. The Angel of Death lowers his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He evaporates in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the brother in comma wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he unharmed he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed vibrates. It's his brother, the porn star. He picks up. ""Hey bro! You'll never imagine what happened. Apparently, I went out to the liquor store and got hit by a truck. They say I almost died.""

&amp;#x200B;

The porn star smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today....you might say that I also came close to Death.""

&amp;#x200B;","I made this joke today, and it's the worst joke. This is an original, please read till the end and you will see.",6

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out, ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact $1,000,000,003.50. The second man thinks for a bit, then says, ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion dollars. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish and then says, ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says, ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The second guy says, ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says, ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says, ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says, ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Three guys are walking through the woods when they find a lamp.,99

The lady tells him that her new husband is a funeral director.

""Interesting,"" the newsman thinks....

He then asks her if she wouldn't mind telling him a little bit about her first three husbands and what they did for a living.

She then pauses for a few moments, needing some time to reflect on all of those years. After a short time, a smile comes to her face as she answers proudly, explaining to the newsman that she had remembered each of her husbands.

The first, she says, was a banker, whom she married in her 20s. In her 40s, she married a circus ringmaster. In her 60s, she married a preacher, and now, in her 80s, she's marrying a funeral director.

The newsman is astonished at this development, having never met anybody who had been in so many relationships with so many different and diverse careers. He asks her why, if there was any reason, did she choose to marry those specific people.

She responds, ""I married one for the money, two for the show. Three to get ready, and four to go!""

So then we get to the city hall and wait in line for a long time. Finally it's our turn and Ving tells me he has picked ""Lee"" as his American name. He steps up to the desk and starts filling out some paperwork, and the whole time Ling is scolding him about disrespecting their ancestry.

Then it's time for Ving to sign his name and seal the deal, but suddenly his eyes well up with tears and he says that he can't do it. The lady at the desk says it’s ok, but Ving has to pay a small fee to cancel his request. Ling groans as she opens up her purse and starts sifting around for cash.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, some Asian guy bursts through the town hall doors.

His friend Koala always invites him out to a lunch at a restaurant after a long and arduous day at the zoo, but because he is allergic to most foods, he cannot eat anything and must watch Koala eat his own food jealously.

After almost two years of this, he exclaims in sadness to his Koala friend: ""Man I hate having to watch you eat all the time, while I can only drink water!""

Koala replies ""There's nothing much you can do, as you're allergic to pretty much every single food out there"".

Devastated, he returns home, but comes up with a brilliant idea. Why not start a company that creates packed lunches for animals like him who are allergic to most foods?

He works on this idea for months, creating a company that is extremely successful that earns him a lot of money from sales from animals like him. Unfortunately, even after all this time, he has not created a name for the business yet, and has found every single name suggested horrible. 

But, at the same time, he is now finally happy that he can have a lunch to eat with the Koala, and no longer has to feel bad about having to watch Koala eat all the time. 

Back at the zoo, Koala asks ""Hey, how's your business doing?"", to which Alpaca replies ""It's going pretty well, but I still haven't been able to find a name yet"".

Koala nods sympathetically, and suggests ""How about we go out for lunch?""

""What a great idea Koala!"", Alpaca replies. ""Alpaca Lunch!""

A mad scientist, up on his secret sea-side mountaintop lair, is working on a life extension serum.  He has nearly perfected it, and is about to begin testing it on dolphins.  

Unfortunately, he has run out of his miraculous elixir!  He needs to whip up a new batch.  The main ingredient is derived from the pituitary glands of young birds.

So he drives a few miles down the beach to the rocky cliffs where the sea birds nest and he begins collecting eggs.  He is able to fill a couple grocery sacks full, and then he heads home.

When he gets home, he is shocked to discover a lion!  It is stretched out, sleeping across the path to the lab's front door!

Very carefully, he tiptoes silently to the lion and gingerly steps over it and the police swoop in and arrest him.

**What do they charge him with?**

I’d say we were there for a solid 40 minutes just having a laugh and I saw this cracker eyeing me off. Didn’t take much to it and just continued enjoying my drink.

My mate decided to try his luck on the tables, so I just hang around the bar, on my phone minding my own business.

This bird approaches me and starts talking to me about the footy and a bit about the upcoming UFC fight... awesome bird. I asked her how old she is and she said 52.... I was like no chance, she didn’t look any older then 40... anyway my mate saw us talking so he just left us alone.

About an hour into it she leans over and whispers, ‘ you’re very handsome, would you join me in a mother daughter threesome?’...

Immediately I felt movement with the old fella and honestly, how do you say no to that? You just can’t...

So, we leave the bar go towards the lifts and up to the top floor. Walking down the corridor I’m nervous but excited.

We get to her room and she gives me them bedroom eyes... fuck I’m hard as a rock at this stage already...

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

On every job he would order the exact amount of bricks as to not have any extra or need more.  He did this on every job until his very last one. He finished laying the last brick of his last job before he retired and said, “man it feels good to be perfect”, when he looked at the ground and saw one brick laying on the ground. He picked it up in an angry rage and threw it realllllly high in the air.

There were two people on an airplane sitting next to each other, one with parrot and one smoking a cigarette. A little while in they start arguing because the parrot is squawking and the man is yelling at her to quiet it. A flight attendant comes by and asks, “what seems to be the problem”. The man replies, “this parrot won’t be quiet!” The woman with the parrot responds, “it’s because he’s smoking a cigarette and my parrot needs clean air!” The flight attendant says, “okay well no more smoking and you need to keep your parrot quiet”, and goes back to the front. A little while later the flight attendant hears some arguing in the plane and goes to investigate. The man is smoking again and the parrot is squawking. The man tries to quiet the parrot when she tries to put out his cigarette then in all the commotion the accidentally throw the parrot and the cigarette out the window. The flight attendant says, “there’s nothing we can do now, I’m sorry”. Time passes when all of the sudden they hear a loud knock on the window.

The friend that was field dressing the deer realized his friend had been gone for quite some time so he went to check on him. Seeing that his friend was asleep, he thought he could not let the opportunity pass. He spread out the guts from the deer on the ground under his friend’s log.

Hours later, the friend returns and exclaims “You won’t believe what happened. My stomach was messed up, I fell asleep while I was sitting over there and next thing you know, I shit my guts out.”

“Oh my goodness!” his friend exclaims, snickering.

He would start a new project at the beginning of every month, and it would always be done at the end of the month, and I would always be the first to see his new invention.

One year though, he was in a slump. I came down to the basemt of the end of the month to find he was already writing new plans. I turned to find a device in his wastebasket. It was a metal cylinder with a press of some sort on it and tubes and wires coming out of it, and a vacuum pump connected to it.
""Did you mess up on your invention, dad?"" I asked

Unwilling to admit he had failed he said ""no, son, I made that as a joke, it was a device that would press coal into diamond, but of course I knew there would be a lot more to pressing diamonds than just pressure!"" I forced a chuckle and left to school.

At the end of the next month I went back down to the basement to find another device in the trash. It looked like a toaster oven with tinfoil and a bunch of wires and batteries connected to it. ""What is this?"" I asked

""That was another joke son, its a device that would fossilize matter in order to make oil, but of course I knew that a bunch of radiation wouldn't be able to do that.""

Over the next few months he would continue to scrap everything he made, and would tell me it was just a joke. My mother was going crazy trying to support the whole family, while his inventions kept failing, and got lazier and lazier.

At this point I was annoyed. I went down the the basement and found him holding an XL sized belt with a bunch of clocks super glued to it. I said with a sigh, ""let me guess. Another joke?""
