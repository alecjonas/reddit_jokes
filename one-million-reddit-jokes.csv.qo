Somewhere in Arizona, the train slows down at a small station and passengers stream on and off. Looking through a window, the cowboy sees an old Native American man wearing what looks like the garb of a powerful Indian chief, sitting on the platform. He stares at the old Indian until a man next to him on the train leans over and whispers, ""That old wiseman has the best memory in the world. He remembers Everything that has ever happened to him, from the day he was born! You can ask him Anything that has ever happened to him, and he'll be able to answer you correctly.""

Amazed and curious, the cowboy jumps off the train and runs over to the Indian. ""Are you the guy who remembers everything?"" the cowboy asks. The Indian nods silently. The cowboy starts trying to think of a good question to ask the Indian.. but the train conductor begins calling All Aboard, and the train begins to chug. ""Uhh... ahhh...."" the cowboy frantically searches for something, Anything to ask the Indian.. the train begins to roll slowly forward... the cowboy panics!

""Ah... what did you have for breakfast?!""
""Eggs,"" the Indian replies.

Cursing his lack of creativity, the cowboy sprints back onto the train. As it pulls away from the station, he grumbles to himself about how weak of a question he had chosen, and what an opportunity he had lost. He fixates on his failure, and cannot find fulfillment in any job in any town all across the country.. all he cares about is finding that Indian again, and redeeming himself. He begins searching across the nation, seeking out gatherings of Indians, wandering from tribe to tribe looking for clues to the old chief's whereabouts. Over time, he learns many Native American languages and becomes familiar with the customs and stories of many of the different groups.. but still he cannot find the chief. He continues searching for years, until years turn into decades, and eventually he, too, is an old man. Sighing in resignation one day, he wearily boards a train headed west, back to California; if he must die unfulfilled, at least he can die where he was born.

And, of course, You, dear reader, know where this is going..  because of how much the universe loves a good narrative, the train pulls into another nondescript little station somewhere in Arizona... and there, on the platform, looking almost the same way he did on that fateful afternoon so many years ago, sits the chief.

Tears in his eyes, the old cowboy hobbles off the train and approaches the ancient wiseman with all the respect and deference he had learned from his time among the tribes. Preparing to redeem himself with a new and better conversation, the cowboy raises his hand solemnly and greets the chief: ""How!""

The chief nods, and says,

""Scrambled.""","A cowboy, bored with his life, decides to head east...",73

He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it. He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds! Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body. He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?""",A man walks into a bar and sees a jar filled to the brim with 10 dollar bills.,8

The bartender asks how he can serve him? The leper asks for a gin and tonic whereupon the bartender fixes the drink and places it on the bar in front of the leper. The bartender immediately turns around and violently throws up behind the bar and then goes about his business. The leper seeing the reaction of the bartender takes out some money and pays for the drink and begins to stand up to leave the bar. The bartender says to the leper, “Sir… you haven't finished your drink.” The leper sheepishly says, “I know but I just saw your reaction and I think I better leave.” The bartender interrupts the leper and says “No sir, it's not you… please just disregard that and finish your drink.” The leper reluctantly sits down and finishes his cocktail. As the leper gets up to leave, the bartender offers him another drink whereupon the leper slowly returns to his bar stool and the bartender prepares a second cocktail for him. Upon placing the second cocktail in front of the leper again the bartender turns around and throws up. Once again the leper is embarrassed and begins to leave and once again the bartender asks him to stay and please disregard his vomiting and just enjoy this cocktail. This continues three or four more times with the bartender vomiting each time he serves the leper a fresh drink. Finally, the leper calls the bartender over and in a quiet voice begins to apologize. He says, “I know I have leprosy and I'm very gross to look at and I am so sorry that my physical appearance and these open sores have caused you to vomit every time you served me a drink.” The bartender begins to shake his head and tells the leper “No sir, it's not your appearance that has been bothering me.” The leper hearing this becomes curious and asks “Well, if its not my appearance, then what has been causing you to get so physically ill?” The bartender replies, “Do you see the drunk guy sitting next to you eating that bag of potato chips? Well, for the last 90 minutes he's been dipping his chips in your right arm!”",Another bar joke,1

firewood
""It's going to be a very cold winter.""
So just to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But after several days, he had an idea. He went to the reservation’s phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, “Will it be cold this winter?”

“Oh, yes,” the meteorologist at the Weather Service replied, “It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold.”

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. “Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?”

“Yes,” the meteorologist again replied, “It’s going to be a very cold.”

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. “Are you sure it’s going to be very cold winter?”

“Absolutely,” the man replied. “It’s looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we’ve ever seen.”

“How can you be so sure?” the chief asked.

“Simple,” the weatherman replied, “The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood.”",It was late fall and the Indians on a remote reservation in South Dakota asked their new chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild.,39

Fred wasn't particularly well trained in the art of train driving, and one day he crashed the train, killing every person on board except himself. He was brought to court on 45 counts of manslaughter, found guilty, and sentenced to death by the electric chair. When asked what he wanted for his last meal, he asked for a banana, and was given one. After finished his banana, he was put in the electric chair, but when they tried to kill him, nothing happened. 

At that time in Wyoming, it was common law to release somebody if an execution had failed, as it was seen as a sign that they should live. So Fred was released, and he immediately went back to driving trains. It seems that he hadn't gotten any better at it, and once again he crashed the train, killing everybody but himself. Once again he was hauled into court, found guilty of 38 counts of manslaughter, and sentenced to die by the electric chair. When prompted on what he wanted for a last meal, Fred asked for a banana once again. After finishing the banana, he went back to the chair, where it failed for a second time. 

Hesitantly he was freed once again. A month later, he crashed another train. After being sentenced to die this time, he asked for a banana once again. But instead, he was given a pizza, which he refused to eat. He was put on the chair once again and hooked up, and when the executioner flipped the switch... it failed again. The officials in the room were very surprised, and upon noticing this, Fred said ""The banana had nothing to do with it, I'm just a bad conductor.""",Fred The Train Driver,2

Yes, an eyeball. He was born with a genetic mutation that only makes him born with an eyeball and no other body part.
He was playing in the basketball court in the park by himself when the neighbourhood bullies showed up and started picking on the eyeball.
They called him fat and told him to get off the court.
The eyeball refused and said one of the bullies should 1v1 him for the court.
They accepted and got their best basketball player to play.
Eyeball was up first to make the shot but had to deke out the bully, but eyeball was planning to make one of his best basketball tricks ever.
One of the bullies yelled ""GO!""
The bully charged right at the eyeball expecting to knock him over but the eyeball did something unbelievable.
Eyeball jumped 20ft into the air and traveled 47ft across the basketball court and made a slam dunk that broke the net into pieces.
The bullies were shocked and frozen with fear.
Then the eyeball turned around and said something that scared the bullies away in terror.
""I may be an eyeball, but eye ball"".

It was 7PM, and the sun's glow was falling. Duney was exhausted, stumbling with his gun's barrel scraping along the desert's sand. 
That was when Duney's world entered a state of slow motion; a grenade had approached him, rolling closer toward him every second - BANG. 

Duney arose from his unconscious the next morning, only to find himself laying on a small bed. The lights blinded him, his sand was loosely scattered on the covers, and he felt a tremendous ringing in his ears. A man proceeded to enter the room, clothed with a draping white lab coat and a stethoscope hung around his neck. The man placed the cold metal on Duney's chest, checking his heart rate. He then begun to walk about, muttering 'I'm sorry' in Duney's direction. Duney then came to the realisation that his legs were missing, from the thigh down - he panicked dramatically, but wasn't able to move. His eyes began to close, and he entered a deep slumber. 

Duney awoke the next month,  being slowly moved into brightness. He was in a wheelchair, a fine one at that, being pushed by an old friend to the horrors of the outside world. 
""W-what happened?"" Duney questioned. 
A smooth familiar voice answered him, his adoptive father - ""You lost your legs Duney, I'm so sorry. You truly were one of a kind.""
""O--o-oh my god no""
""Hey Duney, look on the bright side, you'll fit in with us now, perhaps we could call you 'Du', seeing as you lost your....neys and all""
""Du, huh, I like that"" Du replied. 

(A year later) - 

""Hey Du! Happy birthday to du, happy birthday to du, happy birthday to Duuuu, happy birthday to du!"", The old friend sang. ""Hey Du, I got you something, something life changing""

""Really?!"" Du exclaimed. ""What is it?""

""You'll find out, we've gotta take a visit to that doctor of yours""

""Wha-what why?""

""You'll find out soon enough Du"".

(At the hospital) -

Du wheeled in, only for the doctor to come swiftly running out of his office to greet him, ""Happy birthday du! Me and your friend have planned something for you, I really hope you'll love it - just follow me""

And Du followed. 
Du was led into the doctors office to find a long box led on a coffee table. The doctor told Du to open it, and he did, albeit precariously yet with excitement. 
As he opened it, he caught a glimpse of a foot like shape. Two prosthetic legs sat snug in the box.
""I'm a prosthetist Du, me and your friend want you to live again - for everything you did for our country"". 
""Holy hell, really? No way. No way is this happening"" Du was shocked beyond belief, he would get his life back! 
""Hey Du, it could take months of dedication to make this work, but we can make it happen"". 

So it happened. The doctor, Du and the friend helped Du in every way they could - yes, it took months, but it happened. Du got his legs back. 

(Later) -

As Du began to become confident with his new prosthetic friends, he ventured further outside. He took his first true steps into his new life, and the second he touched the hard ground, god damn;

Duran, Duran.

As he walked to and fro to find a familiar landmark, he stumbled upon a very old and dreary looking building. He banged at the wooden double doors and called out, ""Help please! I am lost! Could you help me?""
The door opened with an eerie creaking sound, and a hooded man whose face could not be seen peeked out, ""Are you alone?""
The young man nodded, positively creeped out but desperate nonetheless. ""I am John and I got lost in the woods. Do you have a phone I could use to call for help?""
The hooded man responded, ""We do not have a phone in the monastery, but you may stay here if you like and leave in the morning.""
Hesitating for a bit, John resigned himself to the situation. ""Yes,"" he finally said, ""that would be helpful. Thank you.""
The hooded man let John in, and he was surprised to see the interior of the monastery to be well-lit and cheerful looking, as opposed to the dreary exterior. The hooded man, raising his hood for a bit, was an elderly monk, or so he said, and the monastery housed about fifty of them. The monk led the young man to the kitchen, where another hooded monk was cooking dinner.
John joined with the entire monk congregation and ate with them. The elderly monk who met him at the door, whose name was Philip, introduced him to the others. After dinner, Philip ushered John to the second floor quarters, where he could stay at a vacant room.
Along the way, John encountered a room whose door was different from the rest. It was ornate, carved with various designs that looked like waves, and he could resist to ask, ""Why is this room different from the rest?""
Philip responded, ""That room houses the monastery's secret. It is something we have kept hidden and only the monks of this monastery may know of it.""
They have reached the room and John was under the blankets in no time, being tired and all from his long walks. In the middle of the night, he was suddenly brought awake by a very strange scraping sound coming from the other room. As he was a hunter and keen of hearing, he judged that the sound came from about three rooms far; precisely where the secret room was. He decided to let it go, when he was awoken yet again by it after some time. When the sound repeated for three more times, he decided to ask the monk what it was in the morning.
Come morning, John immediately asked Philip about the room. Philip replied, ""It is something only the monks of this monastery may know of. I cannot tell you more.""
Possessed of a very sudden curiosity, John asked, ""How could I be a monk in this monastery?""
At length and to much amusement, Philip explained the process to John. After sometime and having finished, Philip asked John, ""Do you understand?""
Thinking for a few minutes, John finally decided, ""Yes, I would like to be a monk.""
What followed was three-month's worth of disciplined training, daily devotion and everything else that was required to be a monk in the monastery. Yet, after the three months, there were a lot of other requirements, such as prolonged fasting, readings, and more disciplined training. In sum, over a year has passed, and finally, John was ordained a monk of the monastery. In all of this time, John's curiosity has not waned, and he was convinced that his unusual curiosity was because of the secret of the monastery, hidden in the unusual room.
Now that he was a monk, after the ordaining ceremony, he was led to the second floor, in front of the ornately carved door. It was Philip who accompanied him, and the elderly monk started, ""Do not be surprised at what you will see inside this room. Be prepared; we have gone to great lengths to keep it and preserve it. Keep the secret to yourself, as long as you live, as would all our brothers here in the monastery.""
With that, Philip opened the doors, and a blinding flash of light startled John. When he saw what was in the room, he was absolutely befuddled.

Etched in a very long sheet of paper were the words 

""The real joke is always in the comments!""","A monastery, a monk, a secret!",1

One from my boss, and one from my wife. Boss texted: ""Hey Nick, I won't be at work today since I'll be going to my mother's funeral, you can have the day off.""

A big smile covered my face and I was ready to bury myself back in my bed when I read my wife's text: ""It's your nephew's birthday today, can you buy him something? I think he wanted those Air Jordan's so maybe you could buy those. Thanks Nick!""

The smile in my face disappeared since I knew that I had to leave the house. So I dressed up in my usual attire and drove to the nearest shoe outlet. I reached the outlet store only to find it closed because of renovation. I decided to head back but on my way I saw this Thermometer Museum.

Written outside the door was ""Free tour only for today!"" I suddenly thought, ""Hey, maybe I could by him something else. I'm sure there's something cool in the gift shop.""

I parked my car in the parking lot and entered the museum. I asked the security guard where the gift shop was but he told me that I had to go through the tour first and the gift shop was located at the exit. ""I have lots of time so let's do it."" I said to myself as I signed up for the tour.

Thirty minutes in I noticed that all the thermometers were in Fahrenheit. I was puzzled for a moment but then I remembered that I was in 'Murica.

It took an hour and a half but I finally reached the gift shop. I walked inside and went to the counter. In the counter was this hot redhead with probably a pair of 34D's. I walked up to her and asked in a seductive voice ""Hey babe, you have anything for my nephew? It's his birthday and he really wants a pair of Air Jordan's.""

The redhead didn't smile at all but said in a monotone voice. ""Sorry sir, this is an American Thermometer Museum, we don't Celsius.""",One Thursday morning...,0

post,5h71yz,2qh72,jokes,false,1481205723,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5h71yz/a_night_at_the_temple/,self.jokes,,"A man is traveling through the country and his car breaks down. He gets out and walks for miles and miles, and the first sign of civilization he sees is an old temple.

He goes inside and asks the monks if he can use their phone. The head monk tells him ""We have no phone - and it is already getting dark. If you like, you may stay the night with us and tomorrow some of our brothers will walk you into town. Not having many other options, the man agrees and he is given a modest room to sleep in.

During the night, just as he is about to fall asleep, he hears the strangest noise. Its unlike anything he's ever heard before, and he cannot, for the life of him, figure out what is making it. He leaves his room and searches the monastery until he comes to a door made of pine. He can tell the sound is behind this door, but it is locked, and he has no choice but to return to bed.

The next day, before he leaves, he asks the head monk about it. The monk replies ""Ah - I know the sound you speak of, and what makes it, but I cannot tell you - because you are not a monk.""

Unsatisfied but helpless, the man walks to town with two of the monks. As he walks he talks to these younger men, trying to pry the info out of them. Like the head monk, they know what made his sound - but like the head monk, they will not share, because the man is not a monk.

He gets back to town in one piece, is taken to a repair garage, has his car towed and fixed and he drives away from this place to get back to his life.

He resumes his normal activities, but the sound haunts him. He finds himself trying to look it up on the internet, and in books. he tries to imitate it so others might guess. He begins to lose sleep, and miss work, devoting too much of his time and energy to the mystery. By the time a year has passed, the man is a wreck.

He goes back to the monastery, finding the old temple as he had left it. He is welcomed in and finds the head monk. He falls to his knees, ""Please, please tell me of the source of the sound! I must know!"" But the old monk sadly shakes his head and days ""I cannot tell you, because you're not a monk.""

The man is devastated! He does not know what to do with himself, but then his eyes go wide. ""Then!"" he says ""I'll become a monk! Let me join your monastery and become a brother."" The old monk nods once.

""To become a monk, you must complete three tasks. First, you must prove patience and focus by counting every stone that this temple is made of. Second, you must achieve enlightenment by answering an unanswered question. Thirdly, you must prove your strength and virtue by existing for five days on nothing but rainwater and dewdrops.""

The man gets his trainee robes and his room and goes to his tasks. He occupies himself for another year, every night haunted by the phantom sound. He returns to the monk, rail-thin and shaking. ""Father! This temple is made of 3,561 stones - 3,562 if you count the granite countertop in the kitchen.""

""My question is 'why is everything always in the last place I look?' I have the answer - it is because I stop looking once I've found it.""

""And I have subsisted for five days and five nights on nothing but the cold rain and my own conviction.""

The head monk smiles softly and nods his head once. ""Welcome, you are not a Monk. Come, brother, what would you like to do first? Surely you would like a warm blanket and some hot stew to replenish your body.""

""No, father"" declares the man. ""I want to know what makes the sound in the night!""

The head monk nods once and leads the man away. he takes him to the pine door, and hands him a pine key. The man takes the pine key, and opens the pine door. Behind it is an oak door.

The man looks back to the head monk, who hands him an oak key. He takes the oak key and opens the oak door. Behind the oak door is a mahogany door.

Losing his humor, the man looks to the father only to receive a mahogany key. The mahogany key opens the mahogany door to reveal a tin door.

The man excitedly looks to the head monk, who hands him a tin key. He uses the tin key to open the tin door, to find a bronze door.

Not looking this time, the man puts out a hand and receives a bronze key. The bronze key opens the bronze door.

Behind it is a silver door.

The man snatches a silver key from the head monk's rising hand. he jams the silver key into the silver door and wrenches it open, revealing a door of solid gold.

He gets a golden key from the head monk. he puts the golden key into the golden door. the golden key opens the golden door to reveal a platinum door.

A priceless platinum key is handed over and the man puts it in the platinum door. The platinum key opens the platinum door to reveal a door studded with rubies.

The man hears the sound and and quickly turns to the monk, taking a ruby-studded key. He puts the ruby-studded key in the ruby-studded door and opens it. Behind it is a sapphire-studded door.

The head monk hands him a sapphire-studded key. he puts the sapphire-studded key into the sapphire-studded door and opens it to reveal a door studded with emeralds.

A beautiful emerald0studded key is received. He puts the emerald-studded key into the emerald-studded door and the emerald-studded key opens the emerald-studded door. Behind it is a door encrusted with flawless diamonds.

Almost out of willpower, the man turns to the head monk, who nods once and hands him a diamond-encrusted key. He puts the diamond-encrusted key in the diamond-encrusted door. The diamond-encrusted key opens the diamond-encrusted door, revealing, a room.

As light spills into the room, he hears the sound again. He looks up, and now he can clearly see what had been making the sound all along!

But, I can't tell you what it was, because you're not a monk.",A night at the temple,44

It's a Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Dog. The Father says to the talent Agent, ""We have a really amazing act. You should represent us.""

The Agent says, ""Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute.""

The Mother says, ""Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.""

The Agent says, ""OK. OK. I'll take a look.""

The Father and Mother exchange a knowing glance, recognizing that the Agent's begrudging interest represents an important opportunity for their Family. An opportunity they can't afford to waste.

The Mother and Father bend their heads limply toward the ground, and let their arms bounce loosely at their sides as they take high steps. While the parents warm up, the Sister propels upward from the back of the Brother and gracefully lands on his shoulders. As the siblings kneel downward the Dog runs up them to take his place on the shoulder of the Sister. The family freezes, arms outstretched.

The Agent says, “See, that's what I mean. That kind of cutesy routine may appeal to the big-top crowd. But we make provocative, modern art. Do something modern.”

Each member of the family separates to get back to the ground. They form a straight line.

With a glint in his eye the Father says, “You should represent us.” The Father breaks out into spirited jazz hands, and to the Agent's surprise begins to sprint toward the corner of the room. As the Father uses a steam pipe running up the corner to ascend to the rafters, the Sister takes advantage of the agent's distraction to square up and disable his left knee with a powerful short-range kick. The Agent screams in agony, “My god! What's happening?!”

“Shut up,” the Mother says as she reaches for a zip-tie on her tactical belt. Soon she has the Agent securely bound, and after a few kicks to the stomach, she drag his limp frame to the corner.

The Mother says the brother, “Watch this son of a bitch for a minute.” The Brother lazily aims his pistol from his hip at the agent's battered face. The Mother runs to the center of the studio, calling out for the sister in mid-stride: “Lock down those fucking fire exits. Are the cameras still recording? Check the gallery then, and hurry.” A few seconds pass, and then a series of three consecutive shots from the production control booth above. The muzzle flashes stroboscopically fill the dark room's window. Mother's covert radio rapidly buzzes in search of frequency and suddenly links up. “Mother, it's Sister. We're on. I've overridden the signal.” Father breaks in, “Master control room clear. No one can shut us down now.”

Mother slams the USB virus drive into the booth's Character Generator and video monitors begin to flash deep red. A piercing screech of metallic static rips through the air. The Agent whimpers but is silenced by a boot to his side.

Across millions of TVs tuned in to the area 9 O'clock news, the screen goes briefly jet black dark. Some witnesses would later describe the piercing shriek transmitting from the news studio as “everywhere.”

“I felt like it was going to last forever,” one recalled, “but then it stopped.”

Alpha SWAT team mobilizes down the street from the television studio, advancing at half-crouch along the fence-line. As soon as they coordinate their positions at the studio's back door, their squad leader signals with a brief point and nod, and they breach. A sun lamp powers on, striking across the back-lot wall where the Bravo SWAT team rappels from the roof and breaks into an upper floor studio office. “Bravo requests 10-101,” crackles across the encrypted police radio channel. “Alpha – 10-101. Alpha, 10-101.”

Father waits until the three Alpha team officers enter the studio through the audience door at the top of the house. From his position among the rafters he fires a high-powered blowgun to bring them each down with less-than-lethal paralysis darts. He wants them to suffer, alive, for their impending failure.

“Jesus,” Bravo leader turns to his squad, “They aren't answering.” Bravo leader has a family at home, and he thinks of them in moments like this. Within the same thought he has the team advancing toward an access stairwell.

Bravo team spreads to two doors on the sides of the stage and enter simultaneously.

In a blindingly bright spotlight at center stage, the family Dog's corpse rigidly juts out from the top of a microphone stand. It's violently impaled to the stand through its neck. All light in the studio extinguishes as a subsonic boom fills the PA speakers above the stage.

The motored spotlight glares back in to life and flashes across the stage, closer to the approaching peace officers: they're brought to a sudden halt by the scene before them.

The Father stands over the fresh corpse of the Sister. Foam quietly dribbles from her puffy, red lips and a red Solo cup is gripped in her dead hand. An officer notes the broadcast camera's recording light are solid red. The Father himself is covered with a bilious brown-yellow substance. “It's shit,” the team leader exclaims. “He's covered in feces.” Bravo leader raises his rifle but the spotlight quickly re-positions to blind their team. In a moment, it's over. Bravo team falls where they stand, victims of venom darts.

As the show goes on, the studio and 911 dispatchers are overwhelmed with calls from the concerned community. A Livestream goes online and thousands tune in over the internet.

The Father directs the Mother to pan the camera toward the front-row audience seats, where each of the SWAT officers have been placed. He walks into frame to address the viewers, by this time fully naked and partially erect. “We have hostages,” he briefly explains. 

An improvised explosive the Family planted in the parking garage on their arrival triggers, irretrievably disrupting police operations as the Fire Department pulls up cautiously to the scene's smoking edge. 

Interviews with live viewers would later reveal they were shocked by the Father's pale white torso, which was emblazoned with the Nazi swastika. Some didn't even register the thin sheen of diarrhea dripping from him until the footage was rerun in heavily censored form. The first nine minutes of coverage never made a second run. They depict an expertly edited murder of the Dog.

In confusion, Bravo leader lifts his bleary eyes. Alpha squad is seated next to them, mouths lolling open and drooling. Bravo leader realizes while he has a raging will to move, he can not. His head droops to the direction of the stage.

The Sister's zombie is about to mount the Brother with a pink strap-on dildo. Fire gleams in the Sister's eyes as she enters her Brother, who winces then moans. The dildo is massive and veined, and disappears into the Brother's rectum. Stage lights go up to reveal the Father and Mother sitting at a card table upstage center. They are eating the Dog, whose hind limbs they've ripped from its fresh corpse. The rest of the Dog's remains glisten under hot stage lights, on a craft services platter on the table. 

As the Mother crunches a wet mouthful of canine marrow, the Brother suddenly screams. His Sister has ruptured his intestines with violent sexy pumping. She rips the dildo from his asshole and the Brother collapses in pain. The Father turns to the siblings with a look of displeasure, slowly chewing his last mouthful of dog meat – and pulls a few stray hairs from his lips. “Wait here,” he instructs the Mother, and gets up from the meal.

The Father calmly walks to the Brother's side, and bends down over him. The Brother gasps and his crazed eyes scan the room as he slowly falls victim to fatal sepsis. The Father unflinchingly puts him down with his concealed sidearm. Blood and brain matter pool at the feet of the disabled SWAT officers, some of whom produce slight groans of protest.

The Mother joins her naked husband downstage. “You make me so hot,” she ejaculates, and kneels to take the Father's penis into her mouth. “I'm going to null you.” The Father breaks into a wide grin, and beckons the Mother to a close-up camera shot. Off-site network engineers are frenetically attempting to cut the broadcast.

The Mother flutters her tongue across the Father's now-rigid diarrhea cock. “Null me, babe” the Father requests, smacking his lips, “Make me a god damn nullo.” With a wink, the Mother deep throats the shitty dick and bites down.

“Oh god, yesssssssss,” the Father groans. The Mother spits up the deflated cock and reflex-vomits the contents of her stomach onto the Father's turd encrusted open groin wound. The Father starts to lurch away while bleeding out, and a random shot from his pistol downs the Sister with a headshot. The Mother faints, and although she is only briefly incapacitated her momentary lack of awareness allows the Father to retrieve his blowgun. The Family is unaware that their broadcast has gone globally viral. Overseas snuff fetishists wake in the middle of the night to capture a recording of the broadcast for their private masturbation collections.

The Father haltingly loads a neurotoxic round. Turning to his prone wife he gently strokes her hair and smiles as he unloads one, two, three darts into her chest. Half of the Bufotoxin on one dart will kill a horse. The Mother's pupils narrow to microscopic dots and she begins to shriek and seize. Thick mucous fills her eyes. 

The Agent sits in silence in the ER's consult room under questioning by a senior Detective. He asks so many questions, trying to dig to the truth about the Father – the only survivor of Studio A beside the Agent. He's being held in critical condition, due to traumatic blood loss, somewhere in this very place. 

Finally, the Agent manages his voice, ""This was an act of pure evil. I've never seen something so depraved and awful in my life. Why would they do this? What do you call it when something this vile happens?"" The Agent softly weeps as his question hangs in the stale unventilated air.  

The Detective stares past the Agent to a one-way mirror, studying his own reflection. Dust motes pass through shafts of late afternoon sunlight peeking through narrow hospital blinds. He's seen a lot of sick crimes in his time, but nothing quite like this. It's as if the magnitude of the transgression surpasses the ability to give it words. He turns to the Agent, and with a sobbing crack in his voice the Detective states: “The offenders have been identified only as The Aristocrats!”",My new version of The Aristocrats (warning: Trigger warning - everything),3

The next week he returns, and sure enough the hunters have bagged two moose. The pilot tells them there’s no way they can take off with the two moose.
Ted says, “I don’t know, the pilot last year took off with two moose.”
To which Bob adds, “Yeah, but maybe he wasn’t a total pussy!”
Not wanting to be outdone, the pilot loads up everything and they start to move down the lake.
The plane is gathering speed, but the pines on the shore are rapidly approaching. Finally the plane gets airborne, but one wing clips the top of a tree. The plane spins, crashes into the trees, and breaks apart.
Sometime later Ted regains consciousness and begins searching for his buddy. He finds him, and when he wakes him up Bob asks, “Do you have any idea where we are?”

When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life and you can perform as long as you want.""     

The man was encouraged. As he walked away, a thought occurred to him. He turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?"". The old man chuckled and replied, ""Your wife simply must say '1-2-3-4.' But be wary; when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""     

The man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and called his wife in the bedroom. When she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men.

His wife left him this morning for a rope, his boss sent him on the worst task and then fired him for not completing it quick enough, then he wrecked his car on the way home.

Once he gets to the bar he has a seat and looks around for the bartender. He calls the bartender over at which he gets ignored several times until finally the bartender finally comes over. 

""What can I get for you tonight, sir?"" Says the bartender.

""I would like a shot of the strongest tequila you have."" Says the string.

Bartender- ""wait a minute, are you a string?""

String- ""why yes I am.""

Bartender- ""I'm sorry, but we don't serve strings here. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

So the string calmly gets up and leaves while wondering what it is the establishment had against a string like himself. He proceeded to walk down the street looking for another bar to get his shot of tequila. 

He finally comes across another and walks in and up to the bar, has a seat, and then waves the bartender over. The bartender comes up and asks him what he'd like to have. He replies, ""I would like a shot of your strongest tequila."" The bartender tells him no problem, walks over to get a shot glass and puts the tequila in front of the string when the bartender finally asks, ""Hey, you wouldn't happen to be a string would you?""

String- ""yes, i am""

Bartender- ""I'm sorry but we don't serve strings here. You're gonna have to leave.""

The string angrily gets up and leaves and begins walking down the street for another bar that will serve him. Not too long of a walk before he comes to another and he quickly and confidently walks in and sits at the bar and waves the bartender over, but before he can even get the bartenders attention the bar security team tackles him and yells, ""NO STRINGS ALLOWED, GET THE HELL OUT!!"" And they beat him up a little and throw him out on to the streets.

The string gets up and is extremely pissed off. His stomach gets twisted and his arms are all over the place. His head is racing and turning about the reason they won't let him get a drink. He crosses his legs and his arms and walks into the next bar he sees. He plops down into the barstool and calls the bartender over and asks for a shot of tequila. The bartender looks him up and down suspiciously and then finally asks, ""Are you a string?""

And the string says, ""No Sir, I'm afraid I'm knot!""

“Ah, you must be new here. It’s a challenge. If you put in fifty bucks, and then succeed at three tasks, you get all the money inside the jar.”

“Really? Man, what a tourist trap! Do people actually try that?”

“Sure.”

“Damn. Still, that’s a lot of money. I gotta ask, what are the three tasks?”

“Well, first, you need to go over to the bouncer over there. Yeah, the tall, muscular guy. And you gotta knock him out in one punch.”

“Wow.”

“Yeah. Next, in the backward we have this wild rottweiler. Nasty dog. Rabid. And it has a bad tooth. We tried having the vet over, but he won’t come anywhere near the beast. The task is to take out his bad tooth.”

“Uh huh.”

“And finally, there’s this lady upstairs. She owns the place. She’s quite old. Sixty five, maybe seventy. Very nice lady. She lost her husband a decade ago and, well … she’s lonely. The task is to go see her and give her some.”

“That is twisted, my friend. Wow. It’s amazing that anyone thinks they can pull all this off. People these days… Anyway.”

The guy drinks his beer, and then has another. And another. And another. Now quite inebriated, he punches the counter and yells, “Whatever man, I’ll do your stupid challenge!”

He throws in a $50 bill, goes to the bouncer, taps him on the shoulder, and WHAM! The bouncer is down in one punch. Everyone in the bar suddenly groups around the scene and starts cheering frantically. The guy shouts, “Where’s the damn dog at?”, people push him to the backdoor, which he pushes. The crowd awaits, hearing nothing at first. Then, muffled screams, punches, scratches and howls coming from behind the door.

Finally, the door opens again, and the guy paces into the bar, slowly, his shirt ripped apart and stained with blood, breathing loudly. Finally, he throws his arms up in the air, and shouts in triumph! As the crowd cheers like crazy, he yells “NOW WHERE’S THE OLD BITCH WITH THE BAD TOOTH?”","Guy walks into a bar, orders a beer, and notices a big jar full of money behind the counter.",2265

He sat on the horse and said ""Few!"" and the horse started trotting. He said ""Few!"" again and the horse started galloping. He kept saying ""Few!"" and the horse ran faster and faster.

Soon into the relationship Six and Four fell in love, but Six knew she could never leave Seven because she was afraid of his violent past.

One cold Autumn night Six came home in tears and locked herself in the bathroom. By this time Seven was already not very sober and pounded on the door demanding to be let in. Eventually Seven's rage took over and he kicked the door down with a powerful roundhouse to find Six standing there holding a positive baby making test. Seven knew he couldn't be the father because he was sterile from years of working at a nuclear plant. Seven saw red and flew into a whirlwind of fury beating upon Six with hammering blows. She screamed ""FOUR, IT'S FOUR'S CHILD, PLEASE! PLEASE STOP!"" Seven stared at Six in disbelief, ""Four? That good for nothing Even aint even a Prime!"" Seven stormed out of the bathroom and out the front door, grabbing his pistol off of the table on his way out. He floored it to the restaurant Four owned like a demon.

Pulling up to Four's eatery, All You Can Eight, Seven threw open the door demanding to speak with him. A young girl named Decimal tried to cover for Four, but Seven spotted him trying to sneak out through the kitchen. Seven grabbed Four by the digit and pulled out his .38. Four begged ""Please, I love her! Please, if you truly love her too you will let her go, please!""

Without hesitation Seven pulled the trigger. The sound echoed throughout the restaurant like a thunder strike. Everyone was stunned for a moment, and then full panic, numbers running everywhere, stampeding over each other. Stomping over Four's lifeless body and in the panic Seven slipped out with the crowd and made his escape.
Since that day Six has moved and changed her name but knows one day Seven will track her down and find her, and she lives in constant fear for her life and the life of her newborn son, Ten.

Well he passive aggressively starts power walking in a random direction for a way around it and possibly an answer! As he cools down he notes that it is extraordinarily beautiful, it must be styled in the ancient Gothic fashion, and yet it is new...curious..

As he was studying the wall, each section different and more ornate than the last, he stumbled upon a postern gate more ornate than the wall, and it's only a postern gate, not the normal ones you or I would expect at the end of some great causeway. Now he is hooked, his stroll could wait. 

He makes his way down the cobble path he discovers awaiting his sore feet, and figures no one would build all of this for no reason, not without some inhabitant nearby. As he suspected he was not far from wrong. 

Yet it was strange, just a two story tavern, built of a fusion of Western styled homes with Japanese styled roofing, and ornamentation. No horses tethered to the pole or any cars or cart or such. He goes in, and there is but one bartended who looks up as he walks in. He is greeted by name, I mean who doesn't know who paul fucking mcCartney is, and so he orders a gin and tonic on the rocks and strikes up a conversation.

The big dude says: "" I saw your curious look and figured I'd just give you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me...? I'm 7 feet tall, I weigh 350 pounds, I have a 20 inch cock, my testicles weigh 3 pounds each, and my name is Turner Brown. 

The small guy says: Turner Brown? Sweet Jesus, i thought you said, ""Turn around.""

So, the grandmother says sit here and let me tell you about those young boys. He is going to try to kiss you, you are going to like that but, don't let him do that. He is going to try to feel your breast, you are going to like that but, don't let him do that.



He is going to try to put his hand between your legs , you are going to like that but, don't let him do that. But most important, he is going to try to get on top of you and have his way with you. You are going to like that but, don't let him do that, it will disgrace the family.



With that bit of advise, the granddaughter went on her date and could not wait to tell her grandmother about it. So, the next day she told her grandmother that her date went just like she said. But she said ""grandmother I didn't let him disgrace the family. When he tried I turned over, got on top of him and disgraced his family.""

She looked down. and saw her husband was holding a battery-operated leisure device, a dildo! Soft, wonderful and larger than a real one.

She went completely ballistic. You impotent bastard, She screamed at him, How could you be lying to me all of these years? You better explain yourself!

Usually she slept through the class. 




One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ""Tell me, April, who created the universe?"" 




When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. ""GOD ALMIGHTY!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""Very good"" and April fell back asleep. 




A while later the teacher asked April, ""Who is our Lord and Saviour,"" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep. 





Then the teacher asked April a third question. ""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.

of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

You are way out of position, rookie!

I don't think these are flowers.

- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

Ken, could you close
the window please?

I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?""

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your ""experience."" Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

You're too late! It's ours now!

""It's been a long night Mr. President. At 2000 hours, a plane was lost over the atlantic with two hundred people on board""

""That's fine,"" Trump replies, ""We have a ton more planes. What else?""

""Well,"" The Secretary continues, ""There was a nightclub shooting at 2200 hours, at least fifty people died and maybe a thousand were injured in the ensuing riot""

Trump thinks for a second, before saying, ""Blame ISIS, next!""

""I hate to have more bad news Mr. President, but a hurricane hit Miami and the city is all but destroyed. We estimate that over a million people will be made homeless.""

""Listen,"" Trump begins, ""I know all about rebuilding houses. People ask me, they say can you do it and I say yes I can, where's your house I'll rebuild it, and in China, you know, they have a tremendous problem with damaged houses and I make deals with them all the time.""

The Secretary looks relieved, and is about to leave when he remembers:

""There was one more thing, Mr. President- twelve Brazilian illegal immigrants tried to cross into the US, what do you want us to do with them?""

Trump leaps to his feet, slams his fist on the table and bellows ""TWELVE BRAZILIAN!? I'M GONNA NEED A BIGGER WALL!""",Trump sits down to a meeting.,0
