The couple places their orders and requests a bottle of the recommended wine. 

The waiter, quite perfected in his task, asks “will that be all,” with poise and hospitality. 

Of course, the wife who’d scrupulously analyzed everything, had a serious question for the waiter. 

She asked him, “I noticed that everything in this establishment is perfect, and almost nothing is out of place! But then I noticed that you have a string tied to the fly of your pants! Is there some reason? Nothing is out of place here!”

The waiter, a bit flushed with embarrassment, politely tells her “you see, ma’am, when I was in training to be a waiter here, they taught us this trick to save time when we go to the bathroom. When I pull the string, it unzips my pants and pulls out my Johnson. Since I don’t have to touch it with my hands, I don’t have to waste time washing.”

The wife was quite satisfied with this answer, and they patiently waited for their food. After their food arrives, the wife runs into a problem mid meal: she’s dropped her fork!

Well, their waiter was keen and arrived almost instantly to replace her fork. He pulled a fork out of his apron and handed it to her. She thanked him and they continued on with their meal. 

Well, as they begin to finish up, the waiter comes by to ask if they’re ready for their check. By this point, the wife had another question!

So, she asks the waiter, “I know you use the string to pull *it* out, but how do you put *it* back in without touching it?”

The waiter, without hesitation, responds, “what do you think the fork is for?”",[LONG] So a couple has been planning a romantic dinner at a ritzy restaurant for some time now.,3

post,7i3pqn,2qh72,jokes,false,1512618221,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7i3pqn/alerts_to_threats_in_europe/,self.jokes,,"The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Syria and have therefore raised their security level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.” The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let’s get the Bastards.” They don’t have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France ‘s white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country’s military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”

The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels .

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final escalation level.

A final thought – ” Greece is collapsing, the Iranians are getting aggressive, and Rome is in disarray. Welcome back to 430 BC”.",Alerts to Threats in Europe,85

post,7hzlc9,2qh72,jokes,false,1512581525,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7hzlc9/the_husband_store/,self.jokes,,"A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more..'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.

Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The First floor -has wives that love sex.

The Second floor - has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited",The Husband Store,89

I looked around for the intruder, and discovered ten little fingers dangling on the porch. So I hit the fingers one by one and the guy falls...and grabs the tree right below. This was annoying me so I grabbed my traveling bag and threw it down on top of him. But my wrist got tangled with the bag straps and I fell with it...hence my death.""

The second man starts. ""I was staying at room 706 and was having a drink with my friend. We got drunk and started to fight and spilled alcohol all over the porch, and my friend left in rage. I sat there a bit, and then I stood up..and slipped on the beer and fell off the porch. I managed to grab the railings downstairs, but some maniac pryed off my fingers and threw me down! Well guess my luck and I grabbed a tree and looked up...and saw a man tied to a huge bag crashing on top of me.""

Now the third man says, ""Well at least you guys know how you died, but I don't even know that. I just followed a beautiful lady I met in the hotel up to her room, where we were going to have a wonderful time but the girl left something back in the lobby so I waited in the room while she retrieved it. But then she calls me and says her husband just went up, so I looked around a place to hide. There was this huge bag so I went it and zipped it up. I heard someone opening the door so I shut my eyes and prayed he wouldn't find me...and I open my eyes and I'm here. I have absolutely no idea what happend!""

Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face. 

The father realizes the boy has swallowed the pennies and starts slapping him on the back. 

The boy coughs up two of the pennies, but keeps choking.

 Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.

 At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly. 

After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last penny, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand. 

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the penny.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, “I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?”

“No,” the woman replied. “I’m with the Internal Revenue Service!”

They had to get up early that morning to leave, and as such the kids are tired and cranky, and it was so hard to get everyone ready that he didn't even have time to eat breakfast. However, this is not a man who skips breakfast, so he made sure to grab one of those little milk bottles- the small plastic ones they sell in individual serving sizes- and is drinking that.

Anyway, only twenty minutes into the trip, the kids are already horribly bored. His wife is wearing earplugs, noise-cancelling headphones, and has a pillow around her head, just to drown out the horrible sound of her children. Her husband can do no such thing, as he is driving, and It's a little bit of a winding road. He goes to take a little sip of milk to cool his nerves, but as he does the car hits a bump in the road and spills all over him. Great. Just what he needed. 

As he reaches into the backseat for his kids' tissue box, he is distracted for a mere fraction of a second, but It's enough that he doesn't see the car coming around the bend ahead of him.

In the wrong lane.

CRASH! The two vehicles collide head on, sending both tumbling off the road and down a valley. The cars roll down 100 feet before crashing to a halt in the riverbed below.

A few days later the man wakes up in the hospital. The doctor comes in to see him.

""Ah, I see you're awake,"" the doctor says.

""What happened?"" the man asks.

""You were involved in a serious accident. You're lucky to be alive"" explains the doctor.

""Are my kids okay?"" The man asks.

The doctor pauses for a moment, and by the time he opens his mouth the man already knows what he is going to say. Upon hearing the news that his entire family is dead, he has only one reply.

""Well, don't cry over spilt milk, they say.""",A man is on a road trip with his family.,6

In front of a cheering crowd, the Pope waves regally from his Pope-mobile, and Johnny clamours to the front in the hope of shaking his hand. 

Alas, the Pope drives past him, and only inches ahead, stops instead next to another child, dressed in a bright red Arsenal shirt. The pope exits the Pope-mobile and walks towards the boy, leaning in and embracing him. He whispers something in the boy's ear, and leaves.

Johnny is green with envy, and begs his dear mother to buy him an Arsenal shirt.

""But Johnny,"" she says. ""I thought you hated Arsenal!"" 

Johnny is adamant, and bright and early the next morning stands again in the crowd, wearing his new shirt. Once again, the Pope waves regally from his Pope-mobile, and Johnny clamours to the front in the hope of shaking his hand. 

This time, the Pope-mobile slows down and comes to a stop in front of Johnny. The pope walks towards him, leaning in and embracing him.

He whispers into Johnny's ear. ""I thought I told you to fuck off yesterday you little shit.""

'Excuse me, Your Holiness,' says the driver, 'Would you please take your seat so we can leave?'

'Well, to tell you the truth,' says the Pope, 'they never let me drive at the Vatican when I was a cardinal, and I'd really like to drive today.'

'I'm sorry, Your Holiness, but I cannot let you do that. I'd lose my job! What if something should happen?' protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.

'Who's going to tell?' says the Pope with a smile.

Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 205 kms. (Remember, the Pope is German.)

'Please slow down, Your Holiness!' pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens.

'Oh, dear God, I'm going to lose my license -- and my job!' moans the driver.

The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back 
to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.

'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher.

The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going 205 kph.

'So bust him,' says the Chief.

'I don't think we want to do that, he's really important,' said the cop.

The Chief exclaimed,' All the more reason!' 'No, I mean really important,' said the cop with a bit of persistence.

The Chief then asked, 'Who do you have there, the mayor?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

Chief: 'A senator?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

Chief: 'The Prime Minister?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

'Well,' said the Chief, 'who is it?'


Cop: 'I think it's God!'

The Chief is even more puzzled and curious, 'What makes you think it's God?'

Cop: 'His chauffeur is the Pope!'

The man gives the Aladdin-like lamp to his friend, who rubs it and, surprise surprise, a genie comes out.


""Hello mortal,"" the genie says, ""I will grant you one wish, but don't fool me, or you will lose that right ! So, what is your choice ?""    
    
The man is impressed and starts to think, and quickly comes up with an idea.      

""You know, I want to make movies, but I don't have anything to shoot with. So I wish for the best cam in the world !""    

""Wish granted !"" said the genie, vanishing while a cloud of smoke forms in the air, above the man. Delighted, he opens his hands and a clam falls from the cloud, landing in his palms. 

The man is confused : 

""What ? That's absolutely not what I wished for""

His friends respond, with the biggest grin on his face :  ""Come on, do you really think I wished for a giant clock ?""

Halfway home, she attempted to change radio stations and saw that there appeared to be only one station. She immediately turned around and headed back to the dealer.
Once at the dealer, she found her salesman and angrily began to complain that her radio was not working, and they must replace it since she only had one radio station. The salesman calmed her down and told her that her car radio was voice-activated, and that she would only need to state aloud the type of music that she wanted and the car would find it.
She got into the car and started the engine and then said the word “Jazz"", and the radio changed to a station playing a Louis Armstrong Masterpiece. She was satisfied and started home. After a while she decided to try out the radio again and said “rock ‘n’ roll"",the radio station changed and a song by the Rolling Stones came from the speakers. Quite pleased, the woman continued driving.
A few blocks from her house, another driver ran a red light causing her to slam on her brakes to avoid a collision. The woman angrily shouted, “Asshole!”

After they fucked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore. The son said he would take the duck back if they fucked again. She agreed. After they fucked the second time, the son left.

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts
and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.

“One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,” said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle.

As he passed, he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate.

Sure enough, he heard, “One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me.”

He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

“Come here quick,” said the boy. “You won’t believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!”

The man said, “Beat it kid, can’t you see it’s hard for me to walk.”

When the boy insisted, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.”

The old man whispered, “Boy, you’ve been tellin’ me the truth. Let’s see if we can see the Lord.”

Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, “One for you, one for me. That’s all. Now let’s go get those nuts by the fence and we’ll be done.”

They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.
