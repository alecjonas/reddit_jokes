The little guy kept crying and the house maid did all she can do but, He kept crying until she brought out Her breast to give Him and he stopped crying.As the small boy was sucking the breast, I entered and saw it, I was so Angry and Afraid that he could contact disease from there, I shouted at the girl, but She knelt down and told me that nothing is coming out of the breast but I didn't believe Her, I decided to suck the breast too to confirm as I was sucking her breast, My wife came in, upon all my explanation,She refused to Understand.....
Please, tell me did I do anything WRONG in making sure our Son is not Poisoned?",Women are just the worst,0

 His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.

''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.""

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.""",One dayBill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt.,51

Dee walks up to the note, which reads ""Push the round button to hear a tone.  Select the appropriate note from the panel.""

E walks up and pushes the round button.

A tone plays.

E says ""Dee?""

Dee says ""No.""

""What?""

""It's not D.  It's D#.""

""Wait, that's your last name?""

""No, E.""

""But that's *my* name!""

""What?""

""All I wanted was to ask a question!""

""Well, what is it?""

""What's the note?""

""I told you.""

""No you didn't!""

At this point, Dee is frustrated.  ""Gee, wha—""

""Okay.  Thank you.""

""What?""

But E had already pressed G.  A voice from the speaker spoke the singular word ""No, that is not correct.""  And a slew of paint balls erupted from the holes on the other wall.

The speaker announced ""G is incorrect.  Your new tone is—"" and then cut to a tone.

E says ""Oh, I know this one!  G#.""

Dee says ""My last name is not sharp!""

""I never said that it was.""

""You just did!""

""*You* said that, not me!""

""I was saying the note, for eff's sake!""

""So the note was F#?""

""No!""

""Then what does F have to do with it?""

""That was a swear!""

""What was?""

""Eff!""

""So that's the note!""

And before Dee could protest, E was pressing F.

The voice erupted ""No, that is no—"" and before it could finish, Dee said ""Be flat!""

""What?"" said E.

And the paint balls began again.  This time, only E was caught in the fire.

""So Bb was the note?!"" said E.

""No!  Listen, just be natural!""

""We haven't even heard the tone yet!""

The tone played.

Dee says ""It's A.""

E says, ""It's a what?""

""A natural.""

""A natural what?""

""Yes.""

""Wha—Oh.""

So E presses A.  And they finally escape.","Two people, Dee and E, go into an escape room.",1

The bartender pours drinks for everyone, and just as he pours the last beer, the little man jumps off of the stranger's shoulder, runs down the bar and kicks over every drink. The man apologizes, gives the bartender a hundred dollars for the mess and asks him to pour everyone another drink. This time he gives the bartender two hundred dollars and says keep the change.

Confused, the priest says ""Of course, but I'm afraid there might be some confusion. I can't help but notice that you don't have any arms, so ringing the bells would be quite impossible."" The little man smiles and says ""I come from a long line of some of the best bell ringers in Europe, and I can assure you that I'm more than capable of the task. I can demonstrate if you'd like."" The priest replies ""Yes, absolutely!"" and leads him up to the bell tower. Once they get there, the little man asks the priest to step back, takes a running start and slams his forehead against one of the huge bells. The bell rings out and all the Parisians down below look up and smile as the wonderful sound that's been absent for so long. ""That's amazing!"" shouts the priest ""Can you do that every hour without injuring yourself?"". ""Yes! Of course! I've been doing this for years so I'm used to it."" says the little man. ""Well..."" says the priest, ""I'm impressed! The job is yours and you can start immediately."" The little man is overjoyed. He steps back, takes another running start and slams into the bell again. As the priest looks on, he jogs back and takes another run at the bell, but trips on the uneven floor, stumbles and falls out the window smashing onto the stone courtyard below. By the time the priest runs down from the bell tower, the locals have gathered around the dead man. ""Who was he?"" one asks. ""He just applied for the bell ringer job. Oh, this is terrible!"". Another person asks ""What happened?"". ""He accidentally tripped and fell."" said the horrified priest. ""What was his name?"", asked a woman. The priest thinks for a minute and says ""You know... he never told me, but his face rings a bell.""

A week later, there's a knock on the doors of the Cathedral. When the same priest opens the doors, he's shocked see another strange little man who looks identical to the man who died, but he has both of his arms. ""Can I help you?"" he asks the man. ""Yes, I hope so. My brother applied for the bell ringer position here last week..."" ""Yes! Yes!"" interrupts the priest ""I'm so sorry! It was a terrible accident!"". The man says ""It okay. I understand. It's one of the risks of the job, but I'd like to fill in for my brother if the position is still available."" ""Of course!"" says the priest, ""but I'll need some proof that you can do the job. Just a formality... I hope you understand"". ""Of course!"" says the man. ""I'd be happy to give you a demonstration."" The priest leads him up the bell tower, and the little man asks him to stand back. He grabs the ropes and begins swinging up and down with all of his weight. The bells ring out, and the Parisians look up again and smile at the familiar sound. The priest is delighted. ""That's wonderful! You're hired and can start immediately!"" The little man is so happy at the news, he begins ringing the bells with all his might. He's swinging up and down, and side to side as beautiful sound fills the streets below. He's swinging so hard that the old, worn rope snaps and the man bounces off the ground and rolls out the window onto the same stone courtyard where his brother died. Once again, the locals gather around the dead body as the priest rushes down from the bell tower. ""What happened?"" one asks. ""Oh my God, this is terrible"" the priest cries ""The rope broke and he fell!"". ""What was his name?"" asks another local.

So when St Peter welcomed them to Heaven, they were keen to take advantage of the first-class relaxation facilities. The husband was particularly impressed by the eighteen-hole golf course and the Olympic-sized swimming pool.
    ‘This is an amazing place you’ve got.’ He told St Peter.
    ‘And there’s more,’ said St Peter. ‘Let me show you the restaurant.’

As they observed the sumptuous buffet serving every food imaginable, the husband asked: ‘Where’s the low-fat table?’ 
    ‘Oh, you don’t have to worry about things like that anymore.’ Said St Peter, ‘you can eat whatever you want here, no matter how fatty it is, and it’s all free. That’s the beauty of Heaven!’

With that, the husband thew his hat to the ground in a fit of temper.
   ‘What’s the problem?’ Asked St Peter.
Turning to his wife, the husband snapped: ‘This is all you fault Ethel. If it weren’t for your goddam bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!’",An elderly couple died in a car crash,20

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete.

The brunette arrives at the man’s ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less.

After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news.

She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.""

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, ""It’s just 99 cents a word.""

Well, with only $1 left after paying for the bull, the brunette realizes that she’ll only be able to send her sister one word.

The people in the village were accustomed to wearing a lungi ( a large cloth which is wrapped around the waist ) over their boxers. The father was no different. He was so happy to get the colorful boxer which he thought he can wear under his lungi.

So he would wear his boxer and the lungi over it, and then fold his lungi till it is well over his knee so that he can flaunt his boxer. The people who saw the boxer were curious and asked, ""Wow, what a cool looking boxer, from where did you buy this?"" His usual reply was, ""My daughter is a nurse in America , and she bought it for me"" . He was proud to let others know that his daughter was a nurse in the US and also the trouser was from US.

One day, the man forgot to wear his boxer and instead just wrapped his lungi around his waist. As he went out to the town, as usual ,he folded his lungi. And this time, to show the full grandeur of his boxer which he thought he was wearing, the lungi was folded well above his upper hip.

I told her: ""MOVE ASIDE WEAKLING!"" And with one hand, I tried picking up the weight. but it was too heavy.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""","A math professor, John, is having problems with his sink so he calls a plumber.",185

&lt;br&gt;
The first accountant walks up to the tax attorney and drops an envelope on his desk. &amp;quot;That&amp;apos;s seventeen hundred dollars right there,&amp;quot; he says the the second accountant, &amp;quot;can you beat that?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The second accountant looks at the first, then to the tax attorney, then back the the first accountant. &amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;in fact, I have twenty-two hundred in cash right here,&amp;quot; and plops down an even bigger envelope on the desk, &amp;quot;Is that what you had in mind?&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By now the third accountant is really animated and is waving his arms around, &amp;quot;Wait, wait, WAIT,&amp;quot; he starts yelling and reaches frantically into his sportcoat, &amp;quot;I can do better!&amp;quot; He pulls out an envelope as big as the first two combined and throws it at the tax attorney, who catches it with both hands. &amp;quot;That&amp;apos;s FIVE THOUSAND dollars right there, take it or leave it.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The tax attorney looks at all three envelops and then at each of the three accountants. &amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ve heard a lot from you three, and I know you well. I see now you&amp;apos;re all serious and want to make this right. But before I decide, I think I&amp;apos;d like to hear what our guest here has to say.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;

The fourth accountant doesn&amp;apos;t say anything. You can hear a pin drop.

The moment he stepped off the train, the smell was nauseating. It only got worse as he approached the first refinery, but bearably so. The sign read ""Steve's Refinery"". He went and spoke to the owner, saying, ""What is causing that *awful* stench?"" Steve pointed at the machinery and said, ""When the lube gets hot, it starts to smell just right down awful."" So he tells Steve to fix it and leaves for the next refinery.

Again, the smell got worse and worse as he approached, but was still bearable. The sign read ""George's Refinery"". To the owner, he said, ""Why does *yours* smell like shit?"" George pointed to the latrines and said, ""The latrines smell bad when it gets hot out."" So he tells George to fix it and heads off to his last stop. *Finally I'll be able to leave this shitty town.*

As he approaches his last stop, he is gagging, his nostrils are burning and his eyes are watering. He vomited at least twice on the way there, and he is feeling light-headed. He notices a sign at the start of the driveway. He decides to try to read it just in case, hoping it's the wrong place. After barely managing to make out the words through his tears and uncooperative eyelids, he turns around and books it as fast as possible, saying,""Mother- !"".

The sign read ""Miss Daffodil's Refinery School for Women"".","Back in the 1800s, there was an oil refinery inspector...",1

Once there lived a landlord in a village.He was rich. He had a daughter which meant the world to him. One day while he was on his way to work, he heard the news that his daughter fell in a well, while she was playing. He immediately rushed to the spot and started yelling for help. No one had the courage to jump down the well and rescue her. It was a long well. He went frenzy. But one man in his mid 30s jumped in. Seeing this everyone started helping him and they managed to pull out the man and the landlord's daughter. The landlord was overwhelmed. He was so happy that he decided to express his gratitude to this man by arranging a party for the whole village, in order to celebrate this man. He even invited the nearby villages for the party. So on the day of the party, the whole village turned up. It was like a festival which was super lit, except for this man who was sad and lost in some deep thought. The landlord said to him 'Oh my dear brother, when no one had the courage to jump into that dangerous well, you did, just to save my daughter, who is everything to me. I arranged this huge party to celebrate your brave act. But why do you look sad? Do you want some gift from me? A land? A car? A house? Spit out whatever your mind is yearning for'. That man who hadn't opened his mouth since the incident replied with a dull tone 'I don't want any gifts. I just have one doubt. Can you clear it for me?'. The landlord was surprised. 'Oh,  I didn't expect this. Well, what is it?' the landlord asked. The man asked with curiosity, ' who pushed me into the well?'

Police check out the scene, and see that the damage is a crack in the floor, and police are shocked. They don’t know how this has occurred, due to no one knowing until hours after it came to be. The day after, the strip club re-opens, and the cracked area is closed off. A week later, the police get a call. They drive down to the strip club, and see the the crack has grown. The police are in shock, and ask the strippers about the situation. Everyone says that it keeps growing overnight, and people don’t notice until a few hours after the growth. By this point, the crack was a foot long, and there was a three-inch gap between the sides. Fast forward to the next month, and people walk in after the opening to find the crack covering the whole strip club. People start to search nearby to see if anyone knows what happened. A block away, on a street, people start to knock on house doors, only to hear sex noises. They manage to listen for a voice, and they recognize the voices. They break the doors down and flood the rooms. Inside the bedrooms, one policeman and one stripper are found having sex. Immediately after the find, all of the strippers and policemen are arrested, and they’re taken in for questioning. The strippers tell the people that the floor was being split by a crowbar, and they eventually made it so that they could convince the policemen to have sex with them, after so many calls, and no hope for the strip club. The policemen are astounded, and run from the scene. A week later, they’re found in the cells with the strippers, having sex. Apparently the cops and the strippers reveal they’re all husband and wife to each-other, and are released from prison. Little does everyone know, though, that the people were lying, and were actually CHEATING on their husbands and wives. After the husbands and wives find out, they divorce their husbands and wives, and marry each-other. After all of this, the floor is still moving. After an investigation, evidence shows that the floor was moving on its own, and the crowbars were just helping quicken the movements. As soon as everyone hears, they immediately divorce each-other, and re-marry. Then, all of the people went missing one day. They were found a week later in the strip club, trying to have sex. The floor, being a hazard, was fixed. Sadly, though, the fix was pounds upon pounds upon pounds (imperial units) of cum was found to be the “flooring” fix. Half a century later, after the death of all of the involved people, the real story was leaked. The real story told that the whole thing was planned, and everyone involved knew about the floor splitting. So what did they do? They tried to get a massive amount of people to cum in the crack to try and put it back together and glue it in place with said cum, instead of hiring someone to try and repair the damages.",A local strip club’s floor is damaged...,0

One night she was confronted by a mugger. He shoots her in the stomach 3 times, takes her purse, and runs away. She is rushed to the hospital and miraculously her and the three babies survived, although she is also rushed into labor. The doctor told her that each of the children were shot one time, and each contained a bullet in them. He said not to worry though, as the bullet would eventually pass through their bodies with time.

The first girls bullet passed when she was 7 years old. She was in the bathroom when she heard a clink on the bottom of the toilet. Horrified, she ran to her mommy and told her what happened. Her mother explained the story of their birth to the children and told the other two not to be alarmed when their bullets passed too.

The next girls bullet passed when she was 10. She heard the clink in the bottom of the toilet and ran to her mommy to show her the bullet. The boy was jealous that his had not passed yet, but his mother comforted him and said it would come with time.

One night, when the boy is 13 years old, he is in his bedroom. He is just discovering his body and starts to play with his wee wee. All the sudden, the family in the other room hears a loud “Bang!” and the boy comes running out and exclaims, “I shot the dog!”","A woman is pregnant with triplets, 2 girls and 1 boy.",3

""Fine, sir, here's one of our best rooms. Room 13,"" says the concierge and hands him the key.

The guy goes upstairs, takes a shower and gets straight into bed. At about 2 o'clock in the morning, two gorgeous naked women come in and slide under the covers. When he realizes what is going on, he starts screwing both of them He can't believe what's happening. Next morning, still surprised by last night's events, he goes downstairs to settle the bill.

""How was your room sir?"" asks the receptionist.

""Excellent, I will come back again. What do I owe you?"" asks the man.

""Well... actually, sir, we are doing a promotional offer. Not only do you not have to pay but we give you $10 as a welcome gesture,"" says the receptionist.

""What?"" says the guy, very surprised indeed. ""That's amazing."" He takes the ten-dollar bill and wanders off, debating whether his buddies will believe him or not. Needless to say, after a few days he's told all his friends and neighbors about room 13 and the amazing night of passion.

The next week one of his buddies goes to check out the room. ""Room 13 please.""

""Certainly, sir, here's your key.""

After he gets in bed, at the same time, 2 o'clock, three girls this time, extremely horny, get in bed and screw his brains out. The next morning, not only does he not have to pay, but he too gets $10.

After a month, everyone knows this hotel and especially room 13. Everyone that stays in room 13 gets the same treatment: a good screw and a ten bucks.

After a few weeks, the story reaches an archbishop. The archbishop decides to check the story out for himself. He visits the hotel and asks for room 13. He gets the keys and goes upstairs. After a couple of drinks he gets in bed waiting patiently for the naked girls to appear. Indeed at about 2 o'clock in the morning two naked ladies come to bed. They are as homy and wild as all the stories the archbishop has heard. The archbishop gets his pecker out and screws the both of them all night long. This is the night of his life.

Next morning he goes to reception and when he asks how much the bill is, the receptionist says, ""Nothing to pay, sir. Actually, we are doing an introductory offer. Here's $50 as a welcome gesture.""

Curious, the archbishop asks the receptionist, ""Well, that's strange. Everyone else who comes here gets $10. Why do I get $50?""

I am responding to your request for additional information regarding how my recent injury occurred. In block No. 3 of your accident report form, I put “trying to do the job alone” as the cause of my accident. You said in your letter that I should explain more fully. I trust the following details will be sufficient.

I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six- story building. When I completed my work, I discovered that I had about 500 pounds of bricks left over. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor.

Securing the rope at the ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out, and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the 500 pounds of bricks. You will note in block No. 2 of the accident report form that my weight is 135 pounds.

Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence-of-mind and did not let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rather rapid rate up the side of the building.

Near the third floor, I met the barrel coming down. This explains my fractured skull and collarbone.

Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.
Fortunately by this time, I had regained my presence of mind allowing me to hold tightly to the rope in spite of my pain. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Devoid of the weight of bricks, the barrel then weighed approximately 50 pounds.

I refer you again to the information in block No. 2. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.

Near the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles and the lacerations of my legs and lower body.
The encounter of the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell onto the pile of bricks. Fortunately, only three vertebrae were cracked.

I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay in pain on the bricks, unable to stand up and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my presence of mind and let go of the rope. The empty barrel weighed more than the rope so it came down upon me and broke both of my legs. I hope I have furnished the additional information you required as to how the accident occurred.",WCB not believing someone could possibly be so severely injured on the job ask bricklayer for more information on how one incident resulted in so much damage,3

The widow decided to check her e-mail expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.

My wife wasn't the brightest student in the classroom to begin with but she's also from a super conservative Christian family that never talked about sex. Basically she had to learn everything from me when we were dating. So it came as no surprise when we first got pregnant that she turned to me to learn how it all goes down.

  


""The one thing I do know"" she told me "" is that you have to feed the baby 'Father's milk' every three days and breast milk after the baby is born.

  


Now, a little backstory. While we have a decent sex life, I have a much higher libido than she does. She enjoys sex... Just every other week or so, where I could go for it every other day. Being a little frustrated at how often (or infrequently) we have sex, I was pretty excited to hear this from her

  


Our sex life improved leaps and bounds. Every 3 days like clockwork she was ready, lengerie, candles, wines - she went all out. The baby never went hungry.

  


6 months into the pregnancy, however, I got a promotion at work and had to go on a two-month business trip. My wife said I would have to turn down the position (you know, for the baby.) I wasn't about to let my last 7 years at my company go to waste, so I figured I'd tell another little lie - we could feed the baby ahead of time. 10 times in 10 days ought to cover it. She didn't seem very convinced but went along with it.

  


Off I went on my business trip. Just as my business trip was about to end I get an emergency phone call from my wife, the baby was coming! A whole month early!

  


I hopped on a plane and rushed to the hospital. I made it into the delivery room just as the doctor was pronouncing that it was a little baby girl. A beautiful black baby girl. I was stunned. Both my wife and I are white.

  


My wife's bottom lip quivered as she explained to me that she had cheated on me and gotten pregnant. But that he had explained that the baby would come out white if she fed it ""Father's milk"" every three days.

  


I stormed out of the delivery room. That bitch! I still can't believe she made me feed another man's child for 9 months! I should have let it starve!!!","TIFU by ""feeding the baby"" after my wife got pregnant",0
