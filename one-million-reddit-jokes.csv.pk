Both of her parents, liberal Democrats, were standing there, so I asked her,

'If you were to be the President, what's the first thing you would do?' She replied, 'I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.'

'Wow - what a worthy goal.' I told her, 'You don't have to wait until you're President to do that.

You can come over to my house and mow the grass, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you $50. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food or a new house.'

She thought that over for a few seconds, 'cause she's only 6.

And while her Mom glared at me, the little girl looked me straight in the eye and asked, 'Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?'

The host announced that Mr. Junji Tsuda will be accepting questions from the audience.

After several questions, a member of the audience stood up and started asking:

""Mr. Tsuda, in my country, there are a group of self-serving people who goose step under the banner of ""get a job!"" My question is, do you vision a utopian or near-utopian society, where people are guaranteed to pursuit their dreams whether it is financially rewarding or not since there is so much to go around, that people are guaranteed to have universal basic income, a society from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs, a society where ""get a job!"" becomes obsolete and absurd because all the jobs are done by robots, and the economy is managed by a super robot that distributes wealth equally and fairly on macro and micro level?

The Japanese expert, though fluent in English, still paused a while to wait for real time interpretation coming from his earpiece, and then he replied:

""Well young man, you can work hard in schools, get a dream job and be financially rewarded if you like."" He paused a bit and went on:

""Or not getting a job and starve to death, it's not like your robot overlord is going to care.""",Young liberal vs. Japanese industrial automation expert,2

She decided to forgo the unstable, war-torn part but instead go for a relatively developed, affluent and peaceful part of the Islamic world.

First thing she noticed after she got off the air plane - Muslim women can and do drive! ""Ah, another islamphobic myth dispelled"" She thoguht. And then she saw women wearing hijab doing shopping without male companions. ""Gee"" she thought to herself:""This nothing like what was told in America's ultra rightwing mainstream media!""

And then she felt a bit hungry and decided to get some snacks and a cup of coffee. She found this coffee shop. Before entering, a middle-eastern man rushed to her side, opened up the door for her and held it, ""after you, dear lady"" the man said.

""Oh my oh my!"" She said, no one did that in Seattle, where I came from! ""Muslim men do respect women a lot!"" She talked to herself in her heart.""Curse them anti-islamic propaganda!""

After the coffee, she decided to leave, but before she taking out her credit card and pay the bill, the waiter said to her: you are not from around here are you? My boss said you don't have to pay the bill, just take it as a welcoming gift.""

She got absolutely flabbergasted. She was so moved that she couldn't walk a straight line. She stumbled outside, unable to hold back tears. 

Right after she got out, she saw a peaceful protest with Muslim holding parades chanting anti-Trump slogans. No riots, no smashing, no looting, just a peaceful parade.

""If only we live in a world without Trump."" She murmured.""We will all be brothers and sisters living together in perfect harmony.""

Being a huge liberal she is, she couldn't help but joined and chanted the slogan with the parade. A Persian looking girl about her age moved close to her and wrapped around her head a hijab.

""Dear me,"" she thought, I almost forgot I should respect their culture!!"" ""Shokran"" she said with a smile to the Persian looking girl.

""You are more than welcome"" The girl replied politely in perfect English. Our liberal took a glance at the hijab and she was absolutely shocked. The hijab isn't a dull grey one or one with traditional Islamic pattern, but an American flag!

The liberal finally lost it. She started crying. ""This is absolutely the best day in my life."" She thought as she took her phone out.

She dialed her dad, who is teaching culture studies in Cal state. Over the phone came a familiar voice:""Hey Chloe my special little girl, whats up?""

The liberal sobbed into the phone:""Dad! Daddyy! Dearborn is awesome!"" ",A liberal goes to Muslim country,0

Schlein would feign ignorance about the game, lose a few rounds with some folks, and ask for advice.  Meanwhile, the stakes of the game would keep increasing as he was losing and trying to earn back his money.  Then he would start to win slowly at first, perhaps lasting until the last ball was left on the table and sinking it in to make the other person feel they almost won.  Invariably, the loser would want another game to try and earn back his dignity and respect from Schlein. Rory would let him hang around until the last few balls and then go on a magical run to clear the table and win.  Each time the player would get furious and demand another game of Schlein, only to lose.  Schlein was well up over his limit and had won all his money back and tripled the amount he lost previously, but he couldn’t leave.  Each time someone new came up and tried to beat him and each time they would want another round.   Finally, he had to take a piss so he headed to the bathroom.  Just then a man walked into the pool hall and asked if Rory Schlein was there, he was gonna kick his ass for stealing all his money back in Demoines.  The other losers said he has been cleaning up all night and asked if was cheating.  The dude said Schlein was a master pool shark that traveled all over the Midwest cheating fools out of their money.  Just then the losers decided they were not letting him leave when he got out of the bathroom and they were gonna kick his ass something fierce.  Many of them gathered near the entrance to the bathroom to jump him when he came out.  The dude locked the front door by putting some zip ties on the handles to keep them closed.  During this whole time however, Rory suspected something because of all the yelling and screaming going on outside.  He decided he was gonna make a run for it and bust out of the bathroom and head toward the front door.  When he burst through, he noticed dudes everywhere swinging arms at him haphazardly, but they couldn’t catch him.  He was looking back over his shoulder when he raced for the door and pushed on it to leave.  Instead he hit his head on the door and fell back to the ground.  Just then, the other dude yells, “Ha, that’s not open Schlein!”   ",The story of the pool shark,2

Of course they all choose to perform a task. So the cannibals send them out into the jungle to pick ten fruits of their choice.
They all run off.
The first guy returns with 10 bananas. The cannibals tell him that he must now attempt to push them all up his ass without crying. He gets to 4 and breaks down in tears from the pain. The cannibals cook him up and eat him.
The second guy returns shortly thereafter with 10 strawberries. The cannibals tell him that he must attempt to push them all up his ass without laughing. Confused but wanting to be set free, he starts. He gets to 9 strawberries but suddenly bursts out laughing. The cannibals cook him up and eat him too.

The first two guys are sitting in heaven. Banana guy looks at strawberry guy and says

There was once a great actor who could no longer remember his lines. After many years he finds a theatre where they are prepared to give him a chance to shine again.
 The director says, ""This is the most important part, and it has only one line. You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a rose. You hold the rose to your nose with just one finger and thumb, sniff the rose deeply and then say the line, ""Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.""
 The actor is thrilled. All day long before the play he's practicing his line over and over again. Finally, the time came. The curtain went up, the actor walked onto the stage, and using just one finger he delivered the line, ""Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.""
 The theatre erupted, the audience was screaming with laughter and the director was steaming!
 ""You bloody fool!"" he cried, ""You have ruined me!""
 The actor was bewildered, ""What happened, did I forget my line?""

We were chatting about our relationships and decided to amaze our men by greeting them at the door wearing a black bra, stiletto heels and a mask over our eyes.  We agreed to meet in a few days to exchange notes. 
 
Here's how it all went..... 
 
My Engaged Friend:   
The other night when my boyfriend came over he found me with a black leather bodice, tall stilettos and a mask.  He saw me and said, 'You are the woman of my dreams.  I love you.' Then we made passionate love all night long. 
 
The Mistress:   
Me too! The other night I met my lover at his office and I was wearing a raincoat, under it only the black bra, heels and mask over my eyes. When I opened the raincoat he didn't say a word, but he started to tremble and we had wild sex all night. 
 
Then I Had To Share My Story: 
When my husband came home I was wearing the black bra, black stockings, stilettos and a mask over my eyes.  When he came in the door and saw me he said....

Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. 
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, '10101000101', on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

The weather was perfect, the passengers were happy, but after just 30 minutes in the air, the plane nosedived into the ground, killing everyone except the pilot.
A few hours later, while the police are picking through the wreckage, a team of detectives are interrogating the shaken pilot, trying to figure out what could've gone wrong.
""I just don't understand,"" the pilot said, shaking his head. ""I went through everything, I have no clue what could've caused the plane to crash.""
One of the detectives who had been standing aside turned towards the pilot. ""Sir,"" she asked. ""Were there any poles on the plane?""
The pilot blinked. ""Well yes, we were flying out of my Warsaw after all-""
""And where did they sit?""
The pilot stared at her for a second before a realization hit him and all the blood drained from his face. ""I understand now,"" he said in a shaky voice. ""I know why the plane crashed. They were all on the right side.""

At some point during human evolution, a certain set of individuals had a slight variation in the genetic code. It was passive and had no effect on behaviour or physiology whatsoever. It was enough difference to make different species, but  could still reproduce with _homo sapiens_. At some point, the gene became ""active."" People showed no distinctions from the other until the age of 17.
From then, they started changing their behavior from normal people to beings identical to humans save the fact that, at many times throughout the day, they started prancing uncontrollably.
It started being somewhat common, and people would guess which of both were they.
They would say:
""Are we humans? Or are we dancers??""

They lived a nice quiet life in their houses made of straw, wood, and brick, respectively. But wouldn't you know it, the Big Bad Wolf came strolling into town one day, hungry for some porkchops and maybe a little applesauce on the side. After asking around a bit, he found out where the pigs were living.  
Wolfie arrives at the first house and yells ""Fe, fi, fo...wait, scratch that! Get your ass outside! I'm starving!""  
Jiggs, terrified, yells back, ""I don't want any trouble! Just don't hurt me!"" The wolf, sensing ol' Jiggs is trying to stall for time, decides to speed up the pig's decision by setting his house on fire. Jiggs smells the smoke and sneaks out the back. He runs to Willie's house, and damn near beats the door down. Willie opens the door to a panicked Jiggs, panting and pale.  
""Willie, hide me! A wolf came to my house wanting to eat me! Then he burned it down!"" Willie, a little freaked out, ushered Jiggs inside.  
Meanwhile, BBW had waited until the straw house had burned down completely, hoping to kill two birds and a pig with one stone. When he failed to smell pork, he knew that the pig had lit out. And he knew where. He made his way to the second pig's house, and yelled again.  
""Oompa, loompa, doompity...aw, damnit! You're gonna get it twice as bad, unless you AND your brother come out, PRONTO!""  
Willie was a bit tougher than his brother, but not by much. He calls out to the wolf, ""Listen, pal, i'm calling the cops! Scram!""  
Wolfenstein was having none of it. He had come prepared. He takes an ax out of his personal effects, and begins whacking away at the front door. By this time, Jiggs and Willie have just about pissed themselves. They run out the back door to the one place they had left to go.  
When they arrive, Elmer opens the door in a bathrobe, clutching a cigar in one hoof and a martini in the other. He says calmly, ""What up, my piggas?""  
Jiggs and Willie look at each other in disbelief. Willie says ""El, it's bad! Big and bad! There's a wolf out for our blood, and he's coming here!"" Elmer, unperturbed, invites them inside.  
""Would you like a drink? I have some cubans too, but don't beat up on them.""
""Didn't you hear me? I said there's a...""  
Just then, they hear a voice filled with rage from outside.  
""I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball, but I predict that with this stick of dynamite, I'll KILL YOU ALL!!!""  
Jiggs and Willie cower in the corner. Elmer, with a smirk, pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and makes a call.  
""Hey, i've got a problem with my lawn. Could you come and fix it? Thanks. Say hi to the wife for me.""  
Wolvers is standing there in the front yard when a big black limousine rolls up. A window goes down, and the air is filled with gunfire. The Big Bad Wolf is filled with more holes than a collander. He falls, dead.  
Willie and Jiggs run to the window, amazed. Willie asks, ""Jesus Christ, Elmer, who did you call?""  
Elmer smiles, and says, ""The Guinea pigs.""",The 3 Little Pigs,5

post,5ujfvd,2qh72,jokes,false,1487295620,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5ujfvd/pink_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"

A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in Iowa .""
 
Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job.

""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor.

""How many customers bought something from you today?"" The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in Iowa , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65.""

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!?  What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""
