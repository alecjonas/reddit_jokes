After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.'

'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.

They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend.

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?' 'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, ER, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?'

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have to admit that I did.'

'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why do you ask?'

'She just died and left me everything.'",9 months,479

Tim was told all about the amazing technology that went into the machine and then as he was almost bursting with excitement he got to drive one for the first time. However the amazing technology was not quite what Tim had imagined and a horrific mechanical fault left Tim nearly dead and horribly injured.
Tim then become disillusioned and hated tractors. He had loved them so much but they turned out to not be the wonderful machines he had dreamed of.

Years later again Tim was in a sauna at a spa. He thought he spied a nice looking lady across the room and wanted to talk to her but could barely see from all the steam. Tim then stood up, sucked in all the steam, went outside and blew it all out. He went back in and sat next to the lady. ""Wow, that was incredible"" she said, ""How did you do that?""

'What do you mean.'

'I caught a golden mouse. It's the punchline to any number of racist jokes.'

'Really?'

So I went into the one I knew best.

A man is having mouse problems. SEVERE mouse problems. He goes into a hardware store and begs the clerk there for help.

""Have you tried cats? Traps?""

""The cats have all run away. One mouse dies in each of the traps and then the others take the cheese. I've tried poison, baits, everything! They killed the boa-constrictor I got. Can you help me? Please?""

""Well,"" the clerk says, ""I might be able to help you, but you *have* to keep this secret."" He then reaches under the counter and pulls out a tiny golden mouse statue.

""What am I supposed to do with that?"" The mouse-harried man asks incredulously.

""Just leave it out overnight. You'll know what to do in the morning.""

Sighing, the man takes the golden mouse home and puts it on his mantle.

The next morning he is SHOCKED to see thousands of mice in his living room, all staring up in awe at the golden mouse.

Carefully, he picks it up. All the mice turn to track it as he moves it off the mantle.

He take a step back... the mice scramble to keep up.

He takes it out the front door. The mice all follow in a little rodent stampede.

Grinning, he walks the statue down to the harbor, keeping it in view of the mice the whole time. All the mice follow him relentlessly. He even picks up several mice along the way, all fixated on the golden mouse.

He hurls the golden mouse as far as he can out into the bay.

Sure enough, the mice stampede into the water, eventually swimming down below the surface to try to reach the golden mouse.

Less than five minutes later, he starts seeing little soggy specks float to the surface by the hundreds.

Fifteen minutes later he's back at the hardware shop.

""Oh, don't tell me that didn't work,"" the clerk says, crossing his arms.

""That's not it!"" the man shouts in excitement.

""You need another one?"" The clerk asks.

""No, no! I wanted to see if you had a little golden [INSERT ETHNIC SLUR HERE].""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",A horse is watching a heavy metal music video,6
post,58p0tt,2qh72,jokes,false,1477077133,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/58p0tt/the_neighborhood_bully/,self.jokes,,"The neighborhood bully was a guy named Horace. He was a nasty, mean, arrogant, sexist, racist jerk who made life miserable for the rest of the town. In particular, Horace's neighbors lived in constant fear of setting him off. Anything from stepping one foot on his front lawn or failing to bring in their trash bins on time would lead to Horace profanely yelling, or worse. 

To make matters worse, Horace was also big, strong, and a formidable fighter. None of the other men in the neighborhood wanted to tussle with him, for fear of a broken nose or missing tooth. Most had accepted that they would have to live their lives walking on eggshells around Horace. 

One day at the neighborhood pub, a man named Douglas had a few pints and started feeling brave. ""Damn that Horace! Last week he made my youngest son cry when the kid's baseball landed on Horace's driveway. The oaf called my boy a terrible name and then threw his baseball in the sewer. If no one else will stand up to him, I will!""

A few of the other men in the bar, also feeling brave, started to speak up. The rabble eventually left the pub, now 20 men strong, ""We'll show him who's boss!"" The group shouted. 

The group knocked on Horace's door. ""We aren't afraid of you! Show yourself!""

""What's all this?"" Horace's face was red with anger at being disturbed. ""Go home before you get hurt! If not, I'll fight every single one of you!""

""We've had enough!"" Douglas spoke up. ""The other day you made my boy cry.""

""That little twerp?"" Horace sneered. ""He deserved what he got.""

Douglas was furious. ""You want to fight us all? That's what's going to happen. You want your beating now, or tomorrow?""

""Tomorrow,"" Horace said. ""I will fight every single one of you cowards. But not at the same time, that's not fair. I want you all to queue up, and I'll fight you one by one. No weapons, and no third man can step in to the fight. I wager that it'll only take one jab or uppercut for most of you. Weak chins.""

""But here's the other rule,"" Horace continued. ""I want each of you to wear the colors of your favorite team. Red, blue, green, stripes, whatever. It'll look funny when all you are sprawled out on my driveway like a bleeding rainbow""

The group thought it over. ""Fair deal,"" they said. ""We'll queue up one by one, and you see how far you get before you're too tired. Our biggest bruisers will be up front, so we have have the satisfaction of seeing out littlest guys finish you off.""

The next morning, Horace woke himself with a cold shower, iced down his knuckles, and put on his favorite fighting shirt. He stepped onto his front lawn, readying himself. But the group who had challenged him was nowhere to be found, had not queued up for the fight, and therefore there was no punch line. ",The neighborhood bully,7

Naturally, having spent much of their lives reading internet jokes, their first inclination is to rub the lamp and excitedly greet the genie that emerges.

""You have freed me from my near-eternal captivity!"" the genie booms. ""As my rescuers, you are entitled to one wish each.""

The first man excitedly blurts out, ""I wish for a billion--""

""Now hold on just a minute!"" the genie interjects, ""This wish comes with a catch. Only about ten feet from here in the bushes, there lies another lamp, much like my own, but black. Black as a midnight sky. This lamp contains the Demon of Ba'al, and he and I made a deal long ago.""

""Ten feet? How many meters is that?"" asks the second man.

The genie frowns at him and continues. ""You see, like myself, he has been imprisoned in his lamp for over 60,000 years. We had only each other to speak with. We made a deal that if either of us was set free, he would help the other.""

""So in order to receive your wishes, you must first walk over, find the lamp, and release the Demon of Ba'al. He will require a sacrifice from you, one that may be most terrible. You will have no choice but to acquiesce, or not only will you forfeit your wish from me, but you will surely die a most painful death.""

The first man ponders for only a second. ""I'm homeless and unemployed, and my wife left me six months ago. I have nothing to lose."" 

He walks over to the bushes and pokes around for a moment until he finds the second lamp. Black as obsidian, its sharp, jagged edges slice into the flesh of his hand as he rubs it gingerly.

A gargantuan, horrifying creature, with flaming red eyes, oily black wings, and great, curved horns like a ram's emerges in a thick cloud of acrid smoke. ""WHO DARES DISTURB MY ETERNAL DWELLING PLACE??"" the beast thunders.

The first man is too terrified to reply, but the demon looks over to see the genie and quickly realizes the situation.

""AH, SO WE HAVE HERE A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE!"" he snickers. ""WELL, WELL. WHAT SHALL WE REQUIRE OF YOU?"" He looks down to see the man's trembling, bleeding fingers. ""YOU HAVE ALREADY SHED BLOOD FOR THE CAUSE, SO I WILL TAKE ONLY ONE OF YOUR HANDS."" Reaching down a long, black claw, he snaps the man's hand off at the wrist as if it was nothing more than a twig.

The first man screams for a moment or two, but then slows to a mere sob as the pain begins to abate ever so slightly. He turns to the genie. ""I wish....I wish for a billion dollars.""

“It is done,” replies the genie, and hundreds of suitcases appear around the man, filled to bursting with cash. He grabs a couple as best he can with his bloody stump and begins to drag them back towards the road where he left his car.

The second man scoffs at him. ""A billion dollars? You get ONE wish that costs you a body part, and that's all you ask for? Not only are you a fool, but you are a cliche fool, the worst kind."" He turns to the demon. “I have a lot more to live for than that poor idiot, but I’m a gambler. I’ll take your deal. What sacrifice do you require?”

“YOU ARE ARROGANT AND FOOLHARDY!” sneers the beast. “I LIKE THAT. I SHALL TAKE ONLY A LEG.” He reaches down and, with his bare, clawed hands, rips the man’s right leg off at mid-thigh. Screaming in agony, tumbling to the ground, the second man can barely manage to form words. “I……I wish for……for 1.5 billion dollars,” he moans through clenched teeth.

“It is done,” the genie says, and another huge pile of money-filled suitcases appears. However, the man can do nothing but lay curled up in the fetal position, clutching the stump of his leg and groaning.

The genie and the demon turn to the third man. “What of you, sir?” the genie asks as the man approaches from the shadows of a tree, where he had been watching and thinking. Something in his face is familiar to the genie. “Wait…don’t I know you?”

The Demon of Ba’al, as well, is struck by the man’s countenance. He steps forward and enthusiastically raises a claw in greeting.

“HEY, DAVE!! How you been, man?”

In his final moments, he asks that his Priest, his doctor, and his lawyer come to see him.  The three enter his room and walk up to his bed.

The dying man looks at the three and says ""I have brought you all here for one final request.  I wish to be buried with my wealth, so that I may have it with me in the next life.  To ensure that it happens, I am entrusting each of you with $300,000 to place in my casket when I am gone.""  The dying man hands the Priest, doctor, and lawyer each an envelope containing $300,000 in cash, and tragically passes away moments later.

There is a grand funeral for the millionaire, and the Priest, doctor, and lawyer sit in the seats in the back.  Each of the three walk up to the casket, gently place their envelope next to the millionaire, and walk outside.  The men are walking home together in silence, when finally the Priest speaks up:

""I am a man of God, and I cannot hold this in.  There was only $200,000 in my envelope.  I took $100,000 out of the envelope and donated it to my church.  I know that he would have wanted the church to prosper.""

The doctor and the lawyer gasped in disbelief at what the priest had done.  However, the doctor also had something to say:

""My envelope was also a light.  I took out $200,000 to donate to cancer research.  I know he would have wanted to try to help others with this research!""

The lawyer stepped back from the Priest and the doctor, and shook his head in utter disbelief.  Finally when he calmed down he spoke:

""I can't believe you two!  Your envelopes didn't have all the money inside?!?  Well, I will have you know that I walked up and put my envelope in that casket, complete with a check for $300,000.",A millionaire is on his deathbed...,17

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?” The monk graciously accepts him, feeds him dinner, and even fixes his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

 Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” 

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” 

The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

Every day they eat their lunch on the top floor of the building they're working on, about 30 floors up. One day when the Italian opens his lunch pail he realizes that his wife has packed him meatballs for the tenth time in ten days. The Mexican is in a similar situation: burritos again for the tenth day in a row. Same goes for the Polish guy: it's sauerkraut for lunch yet again.
After seeing this, the Italian guy is furious. ""This is bullshit! Do our wives really think we want to eat the same lunch ten days in a row? I swear to God if there are meatballs in this lunch pail tomorrow I'm jumping off this building. It's just disrespectful that I work 60 hours a week to feed our family and she can't even take the time to make me a decent meal."" The Mexican and Polish guy find the Italian's argument to be persuasive, and agree that they're also jumping off the building tomorrow if things don't change.
The next day comes, and the Italian slowly opens his pail to find meatballs once again. ""Well, that's it for me. See you in hell,"" he says, and jumps off the building and dies. The Mexican and Polish guys are a little shaken up at first, but when they open their pails to find burritos and sauerkraut for the eleventh day in a row, they jump to their deaths as well, as promised.
The wives are all together at one of the men's funerals when a fourth construction worker retells the conversation he had overheard between the Italian, Mexican, and Polish workers. Upon hearing this, the Italian guy's wife is heartbroken. ""I feel horrible! If I had just put some more effort into cooking a decent meal, my husband would still be here with us today.""
The Mexican's wife is in complete shock. ""I never thought my husband would do this just because he was sick of my burritos! I can't believe it!""

""I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer."" 
The wife said, ""You want a beer, my love?"" She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer -- brands from 12 different countries including Germany, Holland, Japan, Czech Republic, etc.

The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, ""Yes, Lollipop... but at the bar... You know... they have frozen glasses."" 
He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, ""You want a frozen glass, Puppy Face?"" She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that chunks of ice were forming out of the air on it.

The husband, looking a bit pale, said, ""Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres. I won't be long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"" 
""You want hors d'oeuvres, Poochie Pooh?"" She opened the oven and took out several kinds of hot, home-made hors d'oeuvres.

""But my sweet honey... at the bar.... you know there's swearing, dirty words and all that...."" 
""You want dirty words, Cutie Pie? Fine! Sit your ass down, shut the hell up, drink your beer in your frozen mug, and eat your hors d' oeuvres because your married ass isn't going to a damned bar! Got it, jackass?""

""Come in,"" says the podiatrist, ""What's the problem?""
The moth drops down into the nearest chair and says ""What's the problem? I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""
The doctor stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?""

post,58h0wd,2qh72,jokes,false,1476972553,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/58h0wd/three_sinful_men/,self.jokes,,"It just so happened one particular day that three particular men died particularly sinful deaths.

The first was a cattle rancher from Montana who was shot in the back by a jealous husband as he tried to jump out a second story window. The second was a college student from California who overdosed on heroin. The third was a musician from Michigan who had killed himself after murdering his ex-wife.

As the final breaths left their lungs and the final spasms wracked their failing bodies the souls of these men were magically whisked away to the infernal plane to await their final judgment. Naked and chained the terrified sinners gazed about the hellish environs in abject confusion. Without warning a towering pillar of flame erupted before them, and as a blinding shower of sparks dissipated the quivering men could make out a demonic silhouette.

""Kneel before me cretins, for I am your new god!"" screamed a voice equal parts unfathomable evil and undeniable seduction. The command was accompanied by the crackle of a vicious whip and the pungent scent of brimstone. The three men immediately prostrated themselves before the succubus and began to plead pitifully for leniency.

"" Silence you wretches!"" was the heartless reply to their mewling. Amid the choked sobs and sniffles of the bewildered sinners a pointy toothed grin was taking shape on the mouth of the demonesse. As her wicked expression grew more intense the succubus began to laugh a shrill, haughty laugh which chilled her audience to the bone despite the oppressive heat of the fiery realm.

"" Very well, if it is reprieve you seek from your just punishments then I suggest a wager."" the succubus chided. The men lifted their heads and began exchanging wary yet hopeful glances. ""I strike this pact with you three, if I can grasp your manhoods for a count of three times three without thee screaming, falling or fleeing then may you enter the accursed realm of heaven!""

The rancher was the first to respond, gathering what tattered shreds of his dignity remained he stood tall and said, "" well, I reckon it's worth a shot lady.""

The fires of eternal damnation gleamed behind the succubus's eyes as she sauntered towards the condemned man. As her clawed hand closed around his member, the ranchers eyes grew wide with pain. Smoke escaped from the demons grip as the man cried out in ultimate suffering. His Johnson having been reduced to cinders, he was cast down to hell in a stinking plume of fire and brimstone.

The college student was visibly shaken by this turn of events but steeled himself nonetheless. ""I guess I don't have anything to lose..."" he muttered as the succubus gleefully encircled his penis with her smoldering talons. His screams began immediately as his family jewels became a puddle on the ground. He too was cast screaming into the darkness.

The third man was strangely calm, the beginnings of a wry smile dancing about the edges of his mouth. ""A'ight girl, let's see what you got."" he bravely challenged. 

Incensed by the man's temerity, the succubus seized upon his trouser snake with such force it seemed she might tear it off. Expecting to hear immediate howls of anguish the succubus became increasingly perplexed as her awkward tug of war dragged on without a sound. The seconds ticked by without incident until eventually the demon was forced to relent. She stared in awe as radiant white pinions began to sprout from the man's back. The faint sound of an angelic choir could be heard as a thunderous white light broke through the perpetual gloom of hell. The man's face pointed upwards as he began to ascend to heaven.

Frustrated and confused the succubus could do nothing but watch her prize abscond beyond reach. As the redeemed murderer flew out of sight she screamed, "" how?!""

Amid the delicate sounds of angel wings and a heavenly chorus the succubus heard a reply.

""I melt in your mouth, not in your hands bitch.""",Three Sinful Men,0

Since he wasn't supposed to be there, he panicked, and jumped into the closet, just as him Mom and the strange man entered.


He sat in the dark for a while, hearing strange noises, when suddenly he heard the garage door opening, and his mother saying ""Oh Shit! He's home, quick! Hide in the closet!""


Soon enough, the stranger was in the closet, standing in the dark, right next to Bobby.  This disturbed him greatly, and he wanted out of there, so he spoke up.


""It's dark in here, I'm scared.""


""Shhhhh! Be Quiet!""


""I'm scared, let me out!""


""Listen Kid, what will it take for you to keep quiet until we both can safely leave the closet?""


Bobby thought it over, and said $500, and the man readily agreed.


A few days later, Bobby and his Dad are walking in the town, when Bobby sees an X Box display.  ""Daddy!  I want to buy an X Box!""


His Dad sighed, and said ""Son, I already told you, we don't have the money for that.""


""I do!"" With that, he pulled out five crisp hundred dollar bills.


""Where did you get that money?"" His dad exclaimed.


""I can't tell you, it's a secret!""


They went back and forth, with Bobby standing firm on not telling him where he got the money, so finally his dad took him by the hand and said... ""If you're not going to tell your father where you got his money from, you can talk to God about it!"" and dragged him to their church, and pushed him into a confessional booth.


The door closed, and Bobby was alone in the dimly lit chamber, when the window opened, and the Priest asked him for his confession.


Bobby looked at the screen and said in a timid voice ""It's dark in here, I'm scared.""

One night after a long day of work he decided to a local bar to have a couple of beers. After walking around for a bit, he found the bar he was looking for and went in. It was pretty dark and it was not the most classy bar he had ever been to, but he figured that it was just right for this occasion. He looked around and saw some typical bar folk, couple of drunks and.... a man with a big orange head. He couldn't believe his eyes. After a moment of starring he decided to go order a beer and ask the bartender about the orange headed man. So he walked up to the bar counter and after ordering a beer he asked- "" what's the story with that big orange headed man?"". ""Well, it's not my place to tell his story, but if you bring him a couple of beers and talkwith him for a while. I'm sure he will tell you his story"".  The bartender answered. After a moment of thinking and drinking the man thought ""what the hell, I'm here only for a while so I might as well go for it"".

 So he orders 4 beers and goes to sit with the big orange headed man. After an hour of friendly chatting the man finally decides to ask ""Why do you have that big orange head?"". ""Well you have been nice to me and since you bought me beer, I will tell you my story"".
So the big orange headed man starts "" It happened 5 years ago. I was walking on the beach and suddenly hit my foot on something hard.

He is sentenced to death row. When the day comes for him to die, he is offered a last meal.

'I'd like a canary tomato,' he says.

They ask what that is, and he explains that it is a tomato from the canary island.

They send someone off to the canary islands. It turns out there's a shortage of canary tomatoes. The guy searches for days and eventually find one in an illegal black market. He pays $8000 for it, and goes back to America.

The conductor eats the canary tomato and says 'that was very nice.' Then they sit him down in the electric chair, and push the button. BANG. He gets 100,000 volts.

And he survives.

There is a lot of fuss, everyone blames each other, and eventually they decide to try again tomorrow.

The next day they ask him what he wants his last meal to be.

'I'd like a canary tomato,' he says.

Frustrated they send someone off to the canary islands, and they find out one of the last canary tomato is on a single plant at the top of a mountain. He climbs this mountain, and after getting lost, losing hope, thinking he's going to die, he finds a single tomato plant, on which is growing one single, weather-beaten canary tomato.

He gets lost, his head torch runs out of battery, he nearly drowns falling in an underground lake. Eventually, he sees light. He comes to a clearing - he can see the sky, miles above him! There lies one single tomato plant, upon which grows one single, disgusting, withered canary tomato. He grabs it, makes his way out and flies back to America.

The conductor eats the canary tomato and says 'that was very nice.' Then they sit him down in the electric chair, and push the button. BANG. He gets 10,000,000 volts.

And he survives.

She turned, smiled and said, “Business. I’m going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston.""

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your Business at this convention?”

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with Absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.”

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. “I’m Sorry,” she said, “I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don’t even know your name.”

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""

Little Johnny stopped the train and said, ''All you damn assholes who want to get off, get the hell off. All those who want to get on, get the hell on!''
''Little Johnny!'' exclaimed his father. ''I can't believe you are using that language! You should be ashamed of yourself! I want you to go to your room and don't come back until you have thought about what you've done!''
So Little Johnny goes to his room and comes back an hour or so later. He resumes playing with his train, only this time when he stops it he says, ''All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get off, you may now get off, and those who want to get on, you may now also get on. And as for those of you who have a problem with the hour delay, talk to the asshole in the kitchen!""
