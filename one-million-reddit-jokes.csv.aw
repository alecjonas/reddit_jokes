 quaint sitting room. She invited him to have a seat while she prepared

 As he sat facing her old pump organ, the young minister noticed a

The man walks into the bar and it’s empty other than the bar owner setting up chairs in front of the stage with a piano on it.  The owner says “sorry sir we don’t open for another 30 minutes”. The man says “no I saw your sign out front and I’m the best damn piano player in Tampa Bay!”

The owner says “well that’s great, as I said we open in 30 minutes and my usual pianist cancelled today, hop on the piano and show me what you got”

The man starts playing and it’s the most beautiful song the bar owner has ever heard.  “Wow that was great!  Did you write that?” Says the owner.  “Yes I did, I call that song I fucked your mother’s brains out” says the man. 

“Whoa ok that’s a dirty song name, why don’t you play something else for me” says the owner.  The man plays a second song even more beautiful than the first...

The bar owners says “wow that was even better!   Did you write that too? What do you call it?”  The man says “I did write it, I call it your sister’s panties are wet for me”

“Whoa whoa, that’s another dirty song name man.” Says the bar owner. “Here’s the deal, we are opening in 5 minutes, I’d like for you to play piano tonight and I’ll pay you well, as long as you don’t say the names of your songs to my customers in the microphone”

The man agrees, the bar opens to a packed house and the piano player is crushing it song after song.  Until eventually he grabs the microphone and says “excuse me ladies and gentlemen, I need to use the restroom and I will be right back”

The man gets up, goes to the bathroom to take a pee, then walks out and starts heading back to the stage.  Before he gets to the steps a woman with a distraught look on her face approaches the man quickly and exclaims “sir! sir! Before you get back on stage, do you know your fly is down and your dick is hanging out!?”

He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.

The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

We always told the same jokes so we eventually memorized the whole list. And after one year, we no longer told jokes, we would just scream the numbers, and everyone would understand.

So there was one night I told a joke. I screamed: ""Joke Number 04!"". We all laughed, it was a pretty good joke.

My homie Russell told another one: ""Lmao remember number 19?"". That one got some laughs too, it was pretty long but not bad. One guy though starts laughing hysterically.

Little Johnny had become a real nuisance while his father tried to concentrate on his Saturday afternoon poker game with friends and relatives. His father tried every way possible to get Johnny to occupy himself: television, ice cream, homework, and video games, but the youngster insisted on running back and forth behind the players and calling out the cards they held. 

The other players became so annoyed that they threatened to quit the game and go home. At this point, the boy’s uncle stood up, took Johnny by the hand and led him out of the room. The uncle soon returned back to the poker table without Johnny, and without comment the game resumed. For the rest of the afternoon, little Johnny was nowhere to be seen and the card players continued without any further interruptions. 

After the poker game ended, the father asked Johnny’s uncle, “What in the world did you say to Johnny? I haven’t heard a peep from him all day!” 

“Not much,” the boy’s uncle replied. “I just showed him how to masturbate.”",Peace at last!,3

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

He started looking at the pig and thought, ""hmm, not bad."" So, he started making a move on the pig, but each time he did the dog would bark and growl ferociously and pull him off. Every day went by and he'd try to sneak a little hug or kiss toward the pig, but each time the dog, ever watchful, grabbed him off gnarling and grrr'ing. He said to himself, ""what am I going to do? This is soooo frustrating..... wait, I know, I'll let the dog fall asleep and then I'll make my move. So later that night, after the dog fell asleep, he lined up a little dinner atmosphere for the two of them. He slapped a little rogue and lipstick on the pig and invited her over to the table near the candlelights. But just as he went to make his move, the dog sniffed this out and went tearing over to them, pulling him off the pig. He was at wits' end!

A few days later a single man boat crashes up on the shoreline and out from the wreckage pops this tall,gorgeous, centerfold, voluptuous, model looking blonde!! Excitedly he runs full speed at her and starts yelling, ""OH MAN THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.........!!!""

After having their 11th child, a redneck couple decided that was enough. They could not afford a larger house so the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife/ cousin didn’t want to have any more children. 

The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. 

The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (small firework), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. 

The redneck said to the doctor, “I may not be the smartest man but I don’t see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.” 

So, the couple drove to get a second opinion. The second doctor was just about to tell them about the medical procedure for a vasectomy, when he realized how truly backward these people were. This doctor instead told him to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10. 

Figuring that both physicians couldn’t be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count “1...2...3...4...5...” at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand...",That'll do it,18

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: ""As it is my first wife's birthday today, she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.""

The German was first in line; after thinking for a bit he said, ""Please tie a pillow to my back."" This was done, but after only 10 lashes the whip had shredded the pillow. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying in pain.

The Englishman was next up. After watching the German in horror he asked, ""Please tie two pillows to my back."" This time it took 15 lashes, but once again the pillows were shredded, and the Englishman was led away bleeding and whimpering in pain.

The Irishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from the most beautiful part of the world I have ever seen. Because of this, you may have two wishes!""

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Irishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Not only are you an honorable man from a beautiful island, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with admiration. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish?""

One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child. If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife.  'Honey', she said, 'you received a very strange post card today'. 

'Oh, really? Let me see...', he said. The wife gave it to him and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted. On the card was written: 'Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Two with meatballs, one without. Send extra sauce.'",Spaghetti,63

**If you are 40 or older you will think this is hilarious!!!!**  

When I was a kid, adults used to bore me to tears with their tedious shite about how hard things were. When they were growing up; what with walking Twenty-five miles to school every morning.... Uphill... barefoot... BOTH ways Yadda, yadda, yadda  And I remember promising myself that when I grew up, there was no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of shit like that on my kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it!  

But now that... I'm over the ripe old age of forty, I can't help but look around and notice the youth of today.  

You've got it so easy! I mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a FUCKING UTOPIA! And I hate to say it, but you kids today, you don't know how good you've got it!  

I mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet. If we wanted to know something, we had to go to the bloody library and look it up ourselves, in the card catalogue!!  

There was no email!! We had to actually write somebody a letter - with a pen! Then you had to walk all the way across the street and put it in the mailbox and it would take, like, a week to get there! Stamps were 5 pence! 

Child Protective Services didn't care if our parents beat us. As a matter of fact, the parents of all my friends also had permission to kick the shit out of us! Nowhere was safe!  

There were no MP3' s or Napsters! If you wanted to steal music, you had to hitchhike to the record store and shoplift it yourself! Or you had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and the DJ would usually talk over the beginning and fuck it all up! 

There were no CD players! We had tape decks in our car. We'd play our favorite tape and ""eject"" it when finished and the tape would come undone. Cause - that's how we rolled, dig?  

We didn't have fancy crap like Call Waiting! If you were on the phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal, that's it!  And we didn't have fancy Caller ID either! When the phone rang, you had no idea who it was! It could be your school, your mum, your boss, your bookie, your drug dealer, a collections agent, you just didn't know!!! You had to pick it up and take your chances, mister!  

We didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation video games with high-resolution 3-D graphics! We had the Atari 2600! With games like 'Space Invaders' and 'Asteroids'. Your guy was a little square! You actually had to use your imagination!! And there were no multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen... forever! And you could never win. The game just kept getting harder and harder and faster and faster until you died! Just like LIFE!  

You had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on! You were screwed when it came to channel surfing! You had to get off your ass and walk over to the TV to change the channel! NO REMOTES!!!  There was no Cartoon Network either! You could only get cartoons on Saturday Morning. Do you hear what I'm saying!?! We had to wait ALL WEEK for cartoons, you SPOILED LITTLE RAT BASTARDS!!  

And we didn't have microwaves, if we wanted to heat something up we had to use the cooker! Imagine that!  

That's exactly what I'm talking about! You kids today have got it too easy. You're spoiled. You little arseholes wouldn't have lasted five minutes back in 1980's or before!  

Regards, Grumpy Gang  *(Pass this to someone you'd like to make smile, Whether they are under 40 or not.)*",Kids have it soo easy today...,0

it could run wild.

So he doesn't slow down and then sees the car in front of him playing it safe and stopping at the intersection. He slams on the brakes but still hits the car in front.

Looking at the damage from the driver's seat, he thinks; ""It's not too bad, both cars are still running and all the lights are still on. I'll admit I fucked up. I'll be calm and polite and give them my insurance. Everything will be fine.""

He looks further forward at the other car and the driver clearly does not share this sentiment. He is screaming and banging on the wheel. This was clearly the straw that broke the camel's back. ""OK"" he thinks, ""I'll let him vent. I'll stay calm and polite, he'll calm down when he sees this, I'll give him my insurance and we'll part amicably.""

He gets out of his car and surveys the damage. As expected, it's a minor dent with no really damage to either car. He then looks up and sees the other driver climbing out...

""Oh God!"" He thinks, ""It's a dwarf! Say nothing! Do nothing! Be polite! Say you're sorry! Give him your details and go home!""

The other driver looks at the damage, walks up to the man, looks up, and screams; ""I AM NOT HAPPY!!!""

The couple liked their new home very much. The wife received the nature's call and she searched for the toilet. They frantically searched the house for toilet, until they realized that there has been one big mistake in the planning and construction of the house- There is no toilet in the house.

Since nature's call has to be answered, temporary measures are taken. All nature's call are answered in plastic bags and the husband agrees to throw them out into the nearest garbage dump after nightfall.

The following evening, the husband is out on the streets with the plastic bag with the intention to throw it out. On the way, there is a cab-driver who is idling in search for customers. The plastic bag piqued his curiosity and he asked, ""Sir, what are you carrying in that small plastic bag?""

The husband who couldn't disclose the matter out of humiliation replied, ""It's stale pickles. We couldn't eat them anymore so I am going to throw them out.""

The cab-driver was not in a good financial position given his diminished business. He thought to himself, ""If I could get those pickles, me and my wife could survive on that for the night without spending a dime.""

The cab-driver said, ""Sir, you don't have to worry about disposing it off. Please hand it over to me, I shall dispose it off for you.""

The husband was glad that he doesn't have to walk anymore to dispose this shit off and the cab-driver is glad that he has free dinner for the night.

The cab-driver returns home, joyful, and presents his wife with the dinner. His wife warms up some bread and serves the ""stale pickles"" with bread.

""The pickles must really be stale"", the driver thought to himself. ""They smell so bad and the colour is unnatural for food"" ""But nevertheless, food is food"". He thanked God for food and ate it with the bread and slept for the night.

The next morning when the husband was leaving for work, he encountered the cab driver at the same place he met him last night. ""Good morning"" said the cab-driver. ""Good morning"", the husband replied.

One day Tommy rolled into school just like any other day, banged against his locker to open it, started to get his books when, all of a sudden, he spots a new student.

Tommy thinks she's absolutely beautiful. Her hair is perfect, her body is amazing (which Tommy slightly envied, but had gotten over those thoughts mostly by now), and she had an amazing sense of fashion. There was just one thing off about this girl though; she only had one eye, and in place of her other eye was a prosthetic eye made of wood. It didn't even look like a real eye, it just looked wooden.

Tommy saw her and his jaw dropped to the floor-- ""What's her name?"" He asked a friend.

""Oh, her? That's Sally, the girl with a wooden eye.""

Tommy saw past her wooden eye and was starstruck ever since he first laid eyes on Sally. He made it his mission to ask Sally to prom.

Weeks later, Tommy finally gathered the courage to ask his crush the big question. He rolled up to her in the cafeteria and said, ""Hey Sally, I'm Tommy. I was wondering if you wanted to go to Prom with me?""

Sally looked down at him for a second, and said, "" Uhmm.. I'm sorry Tommy.. I don't think so.""

This devastated Tommy. He had felt all sorts of pain and denial in his life from not having a body. He knew what rejection and denial felt like having been left out of all the activities full bodied people could do. But nothing hurt quite as much as this. His heart was shattered. And then Tommy turned into a grape.

So now Tommy is a grape, just rolling around school, and he is depressed like never before. People see Tommy and notice that something is off with him. He's so depressed, that he turned into a grape.

Sally sees this and begins to feel really bad.
""Was I too harsh?"" she asked a friend, "" Maybe I should go try to make it up to him."" Now Sally made it her mission to ask Tommy to the prom, and hopefully he would return to normal.

After school, Sally went by Tommy's house and knocked on the door. Tommy answered, and she was surprised for a second that a grape could answer the door-- but nonetheless, she moved forward with her mission.

""Tommy, I wanted to ask you something... Would you go to prom with me?""

Tommy didn't believe his ears for a second-- the most beautiful girl he had ever seen had just asked him to the prom! Without thinking, he replied,

""Oh wood eye, wood eye!""

Sally was offended and crushed him.

The moral of the story:
Stop while you're a head.",There's this kid named Tommy. He has no body. He is just a head.,2482

I went to a chemist store and asked to talk to a male pharmacist. 

The woman I spoke to said she was the only pharmacist and since she and her sister owned the store, there were no male employees. 

She asked if she could help me.

I said that I really would have preferred to speak with a male pharmacist. She assured me that she was completely professional and whatever it was that I needed to discuss, I could be confident that she would treat me with a high level of professionalism.

I reluctantly agreed and began by saying, ""As a shy man, this is tough for me to discuss, but here goes. I get erections every day that last more than four hours. This condition causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment. I was wondering what you could give me for it.""

The pharmacist said, ""Just a minute, I'll talk to my sister.""

When she returned, she said, ""We discussed it at length and this is the absolute best we can do:

    * 1/3rd ownership in the store

*** This joke is better said than read, but imagine the accents and it’s funny as heck (I think at least...)

A Mexican man is down on how luck. His hours were cut at work so he is having trouble making ends meet.   Because he’s a man of faith, he decides to go to the local park, kneel under his favorite tree, and pray to God. He tells God that he knows he can perform miracles, so to please help him provide a meal for his family that day. 
At that same moment, at the top of a near by hill, a black man is walking home with several bags of groceries. One of the bags rips, a large wheel of cheese falls out, and rolls down the hill. The wheel of cheese hits the tree where the Mexican man is praying and falls to the ground in front of him.  He opens his eyes to what he sees as an answer to his prayers. He thanks God profusely as he runs home with the wheel of cheese. 
When he gets home, he immediately tells his wife, “Maria, God has provided this cheese for us today. You must make nachos with it.”  
Maria says “But mi amor, why nachos?  I can make a delicious quesadilla instead?”  
Th Mexican man then responds, “No Maria, God himself told me that we must make nachos. As I ran to the house with the cheese, in the distance toward the top of the hill I heard the words from God, THAT’S NACHO (NOT YO) CHEESE!!!   THAT’S NACHO (NOT YO) CHEESE!!!",Two men and a wheel of cheese,5

4. My working environment is very hot and no overtime is paid.
5. I work in dark and damp environments without any air.

3. You act on your own accord and you sometimes take more interest in others' workplaces rather than your own.
