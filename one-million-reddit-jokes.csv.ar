Finally he comes across the spaceship of the Galactic Police. He asks them where the actual Jeuk was while holding up Jeuk's photograph.

Man, he thought to himself, if I could have just one more of my wife's cookies I could die a happy man.  

As he lay there thinking about the singular joy of those delightful cookies his wife had been making him so many years he became certain that she was in fact making a fresh batch.  He also became certain, no he resolved himself, that he would not die until he had another cookie.

He couldn't call out as he'd been without voice for some time.  He figured it was useless to hope anyone would just bring a dying man a cookie.  So he decided that he would marshall all of what little strength he had left and he would go downstairs and get one.  He knew that this effort would be his last but that having one last cookie before he went would be one of the happiest moments in his life.

With a Herculean effort the old man slid his feet out of the bed and to the floor.  His legs didn't quite have the strength to carry him and he slid all the way to the floor.  He rested a minute and then he turned over onto his stomach an crawled like an infant out of his room over to the stairs.

The stairs presented the old man a special challenge: he couldn't crawl down them as his arms were not strong enough to do so.  So with great effort he got to his feet and leaned up against the rail and started making his way down.  

He almost gave up but halfway down the stairs the smell of the scrumptious chocolate chip cookies was so strong he knew that he just couldn't quit.  

After about an hour he made it safely to the bottom of the stairs, a mere ten feet from the kitchen where his heavenly cookies awaited him.  

The old man crawled the last ten feet.  He could see stacks and stacks of sweet delicious cookies on the kitchen table.  He had almost no strength left at all and he could feel the wind of death at his back.  It was now or never.

 With great effort he pulled his chest up onto the seat of the chair.  He couldn't get any higher.  But he reached out his left arm, an arm shaking side to side, up and down on it's ascent to the table top.  For a second it didn't look like he'd even be able to grab a cookie but somehow he managed.  

As he brought that glorious cookie down off that table and towards his dying lips the old man's wife appeared and snatched the cookie right out of his hand saying ""You stay out of these, these cookies are for the funeral"".",An old man lay on his death bed upstairs when he caught a wiff,25

So we're all standing around, sweating our balls off waiting for the damned wedding to happen when the groom rushes down the aisle, stands up at the front like he's about to make a big announcement. 

But before he can say anything, his pa shouts out, ""son, what the hell is goin' on? Where's your damn bride?"" 
""Pa! I'm callin' off the weddin'.""
""Whaaaaaaat?"" Came his pa's angry reply.
The son is trembling at this point, but manages to say ""I'm sorry Pa, but I gotta! I found out she were a virgin.""
His pa is silent for a moment while he considers this. Then with an enormous sigh he says, ""quite right son, quite right. If she weren't good enough for her own family, she weren't good enough for ours.""",A Redneck Wedding,44

The High Inquisitor agreed to a theological debate, and whoever won would dictate terms.

The Jews agreed to this and selected one of their best, Rabbi Josef. Josef asked a further term, that the debate should be conducted solely without any words. The Inquisition thought they had this in the bag and accepted.

On the day of the debate everyone gathered at the palace. Josef and the High Inquisitor stood opposite each other and waited for the king's signal.

The Inquisitor started by showing 3 fingers. Josef responded by raising 1 finger. The Inquisitor then made a circling movement with his hand above his head. Josef pointed at the ground in front of his feet. The Inquisitor walked to a table and grabbed a jug of wine and a piece of bread. Josef pulled out an apple.

The Inquisitor stared at Josef for a few moments and finally threw his hands in the air and exclaimed ""OK fine, you win! The Jews can stay!""

Later on, all the cardinals and inquisitors gathered in council solemnly. No one uttered a word until a minor bishop asked ""Your Eminence, what in the name of God did you say to each other?""

The Inquisitor said ""At first I raised 3 fingers to show him the Holy Trinity. He responded with 1 finger to remind me that God is a single entity. I then showed him that God is all around us, but he showed me that God is right where the faithful stand. I tried showing him wine and bread to symbolize the Holy Communion and His forgiving nature, but he showed me an apple to remind me of Original Sin. There was really nothing I could do. He is truly a holy man guided by our Lord, and he had all the right answers.""

Meanwhile, the Jews were having wild parties in the streets, until someone thought to ask Josef his version of events.

Josef said ""There was no theological debate. He first told me that the Jews would have 3 days to leave Spain, but I told him not a single Jew would leave. He told me all of Spain will be cleared of the Jews and I told him we are going to stay right here"".

""And then what happened?""

""Well, he got something to eat, and I thought it would be polite to do the same.""",In medieval Spain,2

Patient: That is correct.

Therapist: Okay, are these videos you're watching a type of fetish or kink that you're embarrassed to tell your wife?

Patient: No I don't think so. Mostly just normal porn. A man and woman having sex.

Patient: They're all different types of women. Different positions. Different clothing or what not.

They leave their ship and waddle towards the first thing that looks like a life form - a gas pump.

""Earthling, take me to your leader"", utters the first alien in a harsh voice. Obviously he is not getting any response. ""Earthling, take me to your leader!"", he repeats now with a stern look on his face.

After the gas pump is not responding to his second attempt he pulls out his laser blaster and says ""If this earthling is not paying any respect I will teach him some!""

""Ehm. Do what you think is right"", his buddy says, ""but wait until I got some safety distance"".

Slightly surprised the first alien lets his companion waddle about 50m away from the petrol station, before he aims again his weapon at the gas pump. ""Earthling, take me to your leader immediately!"", he yells and a few seconds later pulls the trigger.

After the huge explosion he finds himself a good distance away from what is left of the petrol station. Moaning and lying in the dirt he asks his friend ""Why you didn't warn me if you knew what would happen?""

""I didn't know this would happen"", he replies, ""but I am smart enough not to challenge someone who can wrap his penis twice around his hips and still stick it in his ear!""",Two Aliens and a Gas Pump,46

The Lemonade stand owner laughs, and says that he specialises in Lemonade.

The duck blithely waddles away.

The lemonade stand owner looks round, trying to find a ventriloquist or maybe a film crew.

Seized by the moment, the Lemonade stand owner secures the day's takings. 

He then lunges for the duck, capturing it with the thick canvas bag he uses to carry the lemons.

The creature makes surprised noises and substantially struggles.

A passer-by notices the commotion and asks the Lemonade stand owner what it is he thinks he's doing.

The Stand owner tries to explain, and then pauses, as if realising something. 

He releases the duck, which waddles away with an angry quack.

Later, the Lemonade Stand owner contacts his physician for an emergency appointment and change in medication.","A duck walked up to a lemonade stand,",0

He says ""That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with Zebco 404 reel and 10 lb. test line. It's a good all around combination and it's on sale this week for only $20.00.""

She says ""It's amazing you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!"" As she open her purse her credit card falls on the floor.

""Oh that sounds like a Master Card"" he says.

She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way for the blind clerk to know she was the one who farted. Being blind he wouldn't know she was the only one around.

The man ring up the fishing rod and says ""That'll be $34.50 please."" The woman is totally confused by this and asks ""Didn't you tell me the rod and reel were on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.50?""

He replies ""Yes ma'am, the rod and reel are $20.00. But the duck call is $11.00 and the bear repellent is $3.50.""",At a Bass Pro Shop,39

“Wow. A genie.”

“I am a genie,” the genie proclaimed. “For freeing me from my prison, I shall grant you one wish.”

“One? It’s supposed to be three.”

“That’s the price of inflation. Think carefully before making your wish.”

Donald took out his smartphone and reviewed his scheduled appearances. “Well, I’ve got this problem with Palestine and Israel. I’ve been trying to negotiate peace between them, but Palestine is a tough bitch to tame.”

The genie blew out a sigh. “This feud they have has been going on for longer than I have existed, and I am quite ancient. I do not think it is in my power to bring peace there.”

Disappointed, Donald opened Twitter to tell the nation of this setback. But before he could, he saw that Eric Trump had updated his profile picture. Donald held the phone up to the genie. “Can you make my son handsome?”

The genie looked at the pic. He zoned in on the man’s face. A frown formed on his lips. “You know what? Let’s talk about Palestine again.”",Donald Trump was putting through his golf course one crisp morning when he accidentally knocked his ball into the water.,2

figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

Feeling very sad, he went home and sat on his porch until it became nighttime. He was about to give up on marrying when he noticed a shooting star in the sky. ""Hmmm, I wonder..."", he thought; he then wished that he could become a Cinnamon Square, and magically, it worked! So, the next day he went back to the town square and saw the beautiful Fruit Loop again! So, he went up, and asked her out. Because he was a Cinnamon Square, she agreed. After dating for 8 months, he decided to ask her to marry her. As he went to ask her, he was stopped again. She said, ""Sorry, but to ask me to marry you, you must be at least a Cocoa Puff."" Feeling very rejected he went home and sat on his porch again until it was night. He was about to give up on marrying again until he saw another shooting star! He said, ""Hmmm, I wonder..."", and wished he would turn into a Cocoa Puff. Magically, he did! So, the next day he went to the town square yet again, and asked the beautiful Fruit Loop to marry him. However, she said no! He asked her why and she said that because he was a Cocoa Puff, he could ask her to marry him, but she wouldn't actually marry him until he was at least a Reeses Puff. Feeling very rejected, he went home and sat on his porch yet again until it was night. He was about to give up on marrying again until he saw yet another shooting star!

Then, for their honeymoon, they went on a cruise ship and partied through the night.

If our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I’ll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed.

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter’s zip on his trousers. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent.""

I asked ""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don’t know about the others, but I use the spoon.""",Need a spoon?,45

So the man goes into surgery later that week. While he's in recovery, the doctor comes out to speak to the man's wife.

""Is everything okay with my husband?"" she asks.

""Yes ma'am, he's recovering well. It's just...""

""Well, what is it?"" the wife demands.

""Well, we've been trying this new surgery technique for hernias. It makes for a faster recovery but... in order to do it, we had to make your husband's penis two inches longer. I really hope this doesn't affect you negatively.""

The wife scoffs. ""Thanks, but I don't think it will affect us at all.""

Three weeks later, the man goes back to the doctor for his post-op checkup.

""How are you feeling now?"" the doctor asks.

""Doc, I couldn't be better. I feel like a new man.""

""And how does everything feel... down there?""

""You know, I can't complain!""

The doctor is relieved. ""Now, I would advise you not to move any more cinder blocks for another six weeks...""

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.

The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?"" The devil just shrugs and says: ""Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that way"".",An Atheist in Hell,27

She constantly talks about her exploits as a country girl. She talks about her first deer. About killing an antelope. Squirrel hunting, the time she took down an elk. She talks about her past boyfriends and what they killed. But she loves him. It doesn't matter to her that he's a city boy and that he has never been hunting. 

He loves her too. He thinks about all her stories about hunting. About all the animals she has killed. But really, let's be honest, he's thinking about all the stories about the other boyfriends and what they killed.  He noticed the excitement in her eyes. The catch in her breath.  She seems perfectly satisfied with the relationship she has with him. Or is she? Maybe she sees him as less of a man because he hasn't been hunting.  He hasn't killed an animal. 

After many nights of agonizing over the thought of him being less of a man in her eyes he formulated a plan. He would prove himself to her. He was a real man. He would take down a bear.

He went to his local gun shop and loaded up. He bought a pretty .45 pistol. He bought a .22 semi-automatic rifle. Oh my God, he had to have that AR-15 in matte black. He added a shotgun. He bought ammo and more ammo. The clerk taught him how to load everything.  He was ready.

Off he went into the woods. He parked and packed all the guns and rifles.  He was loaded for bear. After 10 minutes,  bear was what he found. Around 100 yards away, he saw him. A big, beautiful bear. Lying under a tree sound asleep. This was the ""Oh Shit"" moment he had dreamed of. He quietly set out all his guns. He was ready. Time to prove his love. He aimed the AR and squeezed off all the rounds. Then the .22 rifle, the shotgun and the handguns.  He emptied every gun he had. He was scared shitless, but he was a real man.

Smoke was everywhere and he couldn't see anything. But, he knew with all the rounds he shot off, that big ole bear was dead. So he went over to the tree, ready to skin the bear, and found.....nothing. just smoke and damaged tree limbs. No bear. All of a sudden he was scared. He was ready to run all the way back to his truck when he felt a tap on his shoulder.  He turned around and saw a huge bear.

The bear said to him, ""Boy, why did you come to my house and wake me up like that? Why did you damage my tree? What was all that noise and smoke? Why boy, I think you might have been trying to kill me.

Scared out of his mind the city boy replied "" bbbbbut your deadddd."" The bear replied "" no, I'm not dead. In fact, you are a terrible shot."" The city boy was scared, but he said, I love my girl. I went hunting to prove my love. The bear looked at him and felt a little pity for him. 

The bear decided to have mercy. He said ""tell you what boy, you have to pay for this, but if you do what I say,  I will let you live."" The city boy was relieved, he said "" I will do anything "". The bear said,  "" you have to suck my dick"".

Now the city boy was sickened by the thought. But, He was also a realist. Who would ever know what he did to survive? So he did the deed and the bear let him go.

On the way back to his truck all he could think about was what  the bear made him do. With every step he took, he would wipe off his mouth and gag a little. His every thought on the indignity of what he was forced to do.  By the time he got back to the truck he forgot his fear and all he felt was anger. He had to have revenge. 

He reloaded ever weapon he had. He knew he had to aim better. He had to kill this fucking bear. He marched back into the woods and saw that smug bastard scratching his back on a tree. Smiling.  Mocking him. He unloaded every weapon he had again. He aimed true. Anger on his side. Smoke and the smell of gunpowder everywhere. 

The smoke cleared.  There was no bear in sight. How? Fear. Time to run. As he turned to escape, he felt a tap on his shoulder and heard the bear ""Boy, what are you doing? I thought I taught you a lesson. I don't want to kill you boy. The city  boy replied,  I have to hunt and kill a bear to impress my girl.  I need to prove I'm a man. The bear thought about it and understood,   He remembered how he tried to impress the lady bears when he was younger.  But he realized how dangerous this human was. He decided that he had to teach him another lesson.  He said ""Now you gotta pay again. Bend over boy.

City boy knew that nobody would ever know. He knew he would do anything to survive so he did exactly what the bear said. This city boy was violated in ways he never knew possible.  But the bear let him go.

As he limped back to his truck  the same anger came back. He had been violated.  This fucking bear wouldn't die. He had to kill the bear to prove his love. By the time he got back to his truck he was ready. He loaded up again.  

This time he crept closer and closer. So close that he could see the white of the bears eyes. He unloaded.  Everything.  Reloaded.  Blasted away again. Smoke everywhere. Then silence. The smoke cleared.....

No bear. Fear. The tap on the shoulder. The bear "" boy, you aren't really hear for the hunting. Are you?",A man who has always lived in the city starts dating a country girl,2
