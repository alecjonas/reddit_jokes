The first apple went in...but on the second one he winced in pain, so he was killed and went to heaven.

The second one replied, ""I couldn't help it. I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."" ",Three Men in the Jungle,58

At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were always seen bumbling around town.

Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion and accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anyone could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy. 

The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. ""Thank you for coming in, Cletus,"" she said sympathetically. ""I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time."" Cletus replied in a somber tone. ""No trouble, ma'am."" The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley. 

""Weeeeeeeell,"" said Cletus. ""I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him over?"" The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. ""Nope, that ain't Stanley,"" Cletus said confidently. The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way. 

She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. She pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley.

""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell,"" Jimmy said pensively. ""Hard to say. Why don't you flip him over?"" The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley."" The mortician was utterly perplexed.

""I have to ask,"" she said. ""Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over?! Cletus said the same thing.""

Jimmy replied, ""Well miss, this man has only got one asshole.""

""Excuse me?!"" the mortician cried. ""What are you talking about?""

""Weeeeell,"" said Jimmy, ""Whenever we'd walk through town, everybody would point and say, 'There goes Stanley with them two assholes.'""",Stanley's Hunting Buddies,6

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed.
 
Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.”

The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
 
All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. ""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder.”
 
“I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day”, commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door.
 
Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose.
 
Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

The devil smiled and said, “Okay: Monica, you're free to go.""

At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on. 
Six feet height, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. 
He glared at the driver and said, ""Big John doesn't need to pay!"" and sat down at the back.

Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was.!

Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.

The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. 
And the next day, and the one after that and so forth.!

This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.

Finally he could stand it no longer. 
He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.

By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

So on the next Monday, when Big John once Again got on the bus and said, ""Big John doesn't pay!,"" The driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, ""And why not?""

With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, ""Big John has a bus pass.""","One day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his bus, and drove off along the route.",38

After last call, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so apparently intoxicated that he could barely walk.  

The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.  After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it.  

He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.  Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights.  

He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  

At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.  

To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!  

Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" 

""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud man, ""tonight I'm the designated decoy.""",Too much drinking!,105

""Trespassing in our jungle is punishable by death."" says the the chief, ""We can kill you right now quickly and painlessly, or you can try and survive a test of courage and win your freedom.""

""What's the test of courage?"" Asks the explorer. 

""You see those three huts over there?"" Asks the chief. ""Inside the first hut you will find a jug filled with a special elixir. It is a powerful hallucinogen that our tribe uses in our most sacred ceremonies, altering both body and mind. One jug is enough for the whole tribe, you need to drink the entire thing yourself.""

""In the second hut is a savage tiger. It has rotten tooth, way in the back of it's mouth. The pain has made it ferocious beyond imagination. You need to go in there and extract the tooth.""

""In the third hut you will find our fiercest Amazonian warrior. She's led up our last 6 campaigns and killed dozens of men. She is vicious and brutal. You need seduce her and have sex with her. If you can do all that we'll let you go.""

Seeing no other choice the explorer reluctantly opens the door to the first hut. There in the middle of the room is a large jug. The explorer pops off the cork and the smell alone is enough to almost knock him out. With tears streaming from his eyes the explorer starts drinking. It goes down like fire, burning his throat and erupting in his gut. Before he's even halfway through he begins feeling the effects, his legs get wobbly, his vision blurs, shadows begin to dance along the walls. He chokes down the last drop and staggers back outside.

The chief catches him just as he's about to fall over, straightens him out, and pushes him into the second hut. The moment the door slams shut behind him the most horrific sounds begin emanating from the hut. It's difficult to know if they are being made by man or beast. After almost 10 minutes of nonstop howling and screaming and gnashing and tearing the hut falls silent. A moment later the door opens up and the explorer walks out.

The man is barely recognizable. He's covered in blood, his clothes hang in shredded tatters. He limps slowly up the chief and says...

""Ok, now where's this bitch with the toothache? ""

The guy figures since this is the only place around for miles he might as well give it a shot. He says to the bartender, ""give me one more beer and a double of bourbon and I'll give it a go."" So he downs his whiskey and chases it with his beer then stands up from the bar, puffs out his chest and with a bit of a twinkle in his eye walked outside and beat the living shit out of that bouncer. He has the attention of some of the bar patrons now as he walks back inside, then out the back door where a pissed off Bubba was waiting. The door closed behind him as the dog started to growl and snarl. The patrons listened as the dog snarled louder and louder and the man started to scream and cry for help. Then suddenly the dog lets out a loud yelp and the guy follows it with a victory cry.

All eyes are on the back door now as the guy reappears, bitten, bloodied and missing part of his left ear. He leans in the door to catch his breath for a moment before saying, ""Alright! Now where's that fat bitch with the bad tooth?""",A guy moves to a new town and is looking for nearby place to get a drink.,6

He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step.   As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump.   A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful. Managing not to yell, Patrick sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the hall mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding.   He managed to quietly find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a Band-Aid as best he could on each place he saw blood.  He then hid the now almost empty Band-Aid box and shuffled and stumbled his way to bed...In the morning, Patrick woke up with searing pain in both his head and butt and Kathleen staring at him from across the room. She said, 'You were drunk again last night weren't you?'  


Patrick said, 'Why would you say such a mean thing?' Well,' Kathleen said, 'it could be the open front door, it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs, it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house, it could be your bloodshot eyes, but mostly ....... it's all those Band-Aids stuck on the hall mirror.'

The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.

Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available.  An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.

When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradise

Finally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.

The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.

666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.

When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.

When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.

When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong. The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:

""I don't have a lighter""

The second man says ""I wish for unlimited money"" ""Alright"" says the Genie ""Check your bank account"" The man checks on his phone and sure enough there's an infinity sign on his bank balance.

The third man says ""I want my right arm to rotate clockwise until the day I die"" ""Urm, ok?"" says the genie, and just like that the man's arm starts rotating clockwise. ""Now, it's time for your second wish.""

The first man says ""I wish for a beautiful wife"" The Genie snaps his fingers and just like that, a beautiful woman appears at the man's side.

The second man says ""I want to be confident, and charismatic so I can get any woman I want"" ""OK"" says the genie, and the man starts to feel much more confident in himself, he could get anyone.

The third man says ""I want my left arm to rotate anti-clockwise until the day I die"" The genie is confused but grants his wish none-the-less and the man's left arm begins rotating anticlockwise. ""Now for your final wishes.""

The first man says ""I never want to be ill for the rest of my life!"" ""Ok"" says the Genie ""You will be healthy until the day you die.""

The second man says ""I want to be immortal"" ""You will live forever!"" says the Genie

The third man says ""I want my head to nod up and down for the rest of my life"" The Genie sighs, but grants the man's final wish and his head begins to nod up and down.

Years later, the first two men are in a bar catching up. The first man says ""Life is great! I invested my million dollars and now have twenty! My wife is still beautiful and I'm never going to be ill a day in my life!"" ""That's nice"" replies the second man ""I've been with hundreds of women way more beautiful than your wife, I've donated billions to charity with my unlimited money and can continue to live a life of luxury forever because i'm immortal.""

At this point, the third man walks in, head bobbing up and down, arms swinging like a maniac and he says ""Guys, I think I fucked up""","3 men are walking through the desert when they stumble across a lamp.

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...

""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.

The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

""I can't believe they've sold out of *all* their lines of winter jackets!"" I say to my friend.

So then we go to Canada Goose. Even though their lines of clothing are usually pretty expensive, their product is also super comfortable, and I've loved every Canada Goose jacket I've owned.

However, our luck didn't turn around, as all their products were sold out too.

People were really preparing for the winter, huh? Even the expensive products like Canada Goose were completely sold out. No matter what store we went to, all their lines of clothing were sold out.

Columbia, Marmot, it didn't matter.

The snow outside was really starting to fall, so we decided to cut our losses and head home for the day. However, just as we were about to leave, my friend taps me on the shoulder.

She wished her family could come to America, but I only had enough money to send to her.

Every time I messaged her, she seemed to always have a different way of looking at things .

She always sounded very different every time we talked.

Yet, we agreed to meet, and she flew in from another country.

I noticed she was really tall, quite and and wore long dresses in person.

She convinced me to marry quickly, I agreed.

She ducked awkwardly each time to get in and out of a cab.

We where wed, right away and she got her citizenship.

It all was moving so fast in those long two days.

That night, I thought we might finally spend our wedding night together.

I left our hotel room briefly to gets some more ice.

On the way back I had to look at my key number several times, and match it to the door.

Because when I opened the door, to my shock, three midgets came out of the hotel room, pushing me aside.

For some reason, one looked just like her, but only in the face.

I never found where she went, though.

I guess it's back to the dating site.",Did a really tall woman walk this way ?,0

Ruth called up Bertram and invited him out to dinner to view the saddle, one thing led to another and the two started dating. Years passed and they were married in a beautiful old church illuminated by hundreds of rare lamps. Ruth's favorite kind of lamps were the any that look like animals, she thought they were so cute and she was close to owning a lamp of every kind of animal, only missing a few of the obscurer Asian ones. Antique dealing was her job but the lamps were her collection.

&amp;#x200B;

Years of happy marriage passed with Bertram and Ruth making a cute couple since they were almost exactly the same size. They often wore each others sweaters with a hat on you could practically mistake one for the other. Around their 10th anniversary Bertram's mother Betty passed away. They were heartbroken but she had lived a happy life and died peacefully. To honor her Bertram named his newest racing horse after her.

&amp;#x200B;

One day Bertram slipped and fell on his way into the barn one morning, he was getting older and even though he was quite athletic he managed to break his hip in the fall. He quickly called his wife Ruth and told her that she would need to ride this race for him. His new horse was beautiful midnight color without a patch of white on her and he was certain could win the race no matter who road her. So his wife dutifully came to the barn, put on her husbands riding gear, and headed off to the race.

&amp;#x200B;

Bertram watched on the TV from his hospital bed as his wife mounted Betty and made her way to the starting line. She had her helmet pulled low so nobody would realize Ruth wasn't Bertram himself. Then they were off! Betty ran like lightning leaving all the horses behind but just as Ruth was about to cross the finish line she spied a lamp sitting on a table in one of the racetrack's private boxes. It was perfect, the Asian animal lamp of Ruth's dreams, and it was about to be sold to another buyer. In a split second Ruth decided to chase her dream instead of finishing the race and she screamed at the top of her lungs: ""WHOA BLACK BETTY! PANDA LAMP!""",An antique dealer met a jockey...,2

To get away from everyone he decided to take a vacation far out west to find peace and solitude; a place where no one would bother him. 

He rented a cabin deep in the wilds of Montana, with no civilization around for a hundred miles. Everything was amazing. The cabin was small and cozy, high up in the mountains with a beautiful view above the forest. 

A few days later, Tom was outside relaxing and reading a book when he saw in the distance a sight that made his heart sink: a rusty old pickup truck driving right up to the cabin.

A big old grizzly mountain man hops out of the truck and shouts, ""Oh hey there! I live on the other side of that there mountain! I'm hosting a party for all of the neighbors tonight, and you would be welcome to join!""

Tom stopped him in his tracks: ""I'm sorry, sir, but I'm here to get away from...""

The mountain man interrupted: ""But before you say yes, I gotta warn ya...there's going to be some DRINKIN'. I make the best sweet berry moonshine you've ever tasted.""

Tom was quick to answer: ""Well sir, as great as your moonshine may be, I still have to say...""

But the mountain man interrupted again: ""Oh, and I gotta warn ya...there may be some FIGHTIN'. It can get a little rowdy sometimes after drinking my moonshine.""

Tom once again answered dutifully: ""Well sir, I work at a bar in New York City. I've seen my share of drunks and rough behavior, but I still have to say n-...""

The mountain man again interrupts: ""Before you say yes, I gotta warn ya... there's gonna be some SEX. After being alone for so long the neighbors get a little frisky after drinking my moonshine.""

At this, his curiosity was piqued. ""Sir, I've seen things in New York City you've only dreamed of, I'm sure I can handle this backwoods party. I'd be happy to come to your party. I suppose it's the neighborly thing to do.""

The mountain man was delighted. With the party only hours away, Tom decides to follow the rusty old pickup truck to the cabin where the mountain man lives. 

While waiting for the party to start Tom tries the sweet berry moonshine. He has tried every liquor imagined while working at the bar, but this by far was one of the best he has ever had. After a few hours of drinking and talking to the mountain man, Tom realizes that no one else has shown up to the party. He asks, ""When will the neighbors arrive?""

The mountain man responds: ""Oh, in these mountains there's nobody around for a hundred miles. So what do you want to do next, fight or have sex?"" 

Tom gets scared and tries to sprint for the door as the mountain man proclaims: ""I guess we're going to fight first.""",Mountain Moonshine,9

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA.

He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.

A Dutchman, a German and a Belgian are on a diving board at a magic swimming pool. They have been told that the water will change into anything they scream while jumping into the pool.

The Dutchman goes first, he takes a run, jumps, and screams ‘Milk!’ The water in the pool quickly transforms to milk and after a few minutes of swimming and drinking he happily steps out of the pool.

The German goes next, he stands on the diving board, takes a tiny hop, and screems ‘Beer!’. He makes a dive bomb, enjoys swimming and drinking the beer. After a while he starts to get tipsy and decides he had enough, so het gets out the pool.

The Belgian, now aware of all the opportunities, gets excited and takes a step back  to prepare for his run. So he runs on the diving board, slips over the German’s beer from the dive bomb from before and screams ‘Shit!’.

Curious as he is he gives the lamp a rub and a genie appears. The genie proclaims ""For freeing me I shall grant you 3 wishes"". The man is stunned and scrambles for a bit, but eventually he figures out his first wish. 

He wishes to always have enough money in his pocket for the purchase he's about to make. The genie grants the wish, and it works when the man tries it out at a near bar.

Amazed, the man thinks for another while about his second wish. Finally, he wishes for true love. Before he knows it the love of his life appears before him and they both cuddle for a while until the genie reminds him he has another wish.

The man thinks a bit again and because for all his life he's been self conscious about his teeth, he wishes for a perfect set of teeth. The genie grants his wish for the last time. The man checks a mirror and sees no difference. Confused the man asks what happened. The genie replies ""Nothing. Check your pocket"". The man pulls a box out of his pocket and opens it. Inside he finds 32 of the most white and straight teeth he has ever seen. Horrified he looks at the genie ""What? I even gave you a nice box to shake them in.""",A man walks on a beach and finds a lamp,3
