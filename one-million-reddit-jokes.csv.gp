He searched the surrounding country, and found a lovely spot with frontage on a small river. They built a cabin, and began spending time there every chance they got. The kids loved it, and friends came for the quiet and fishing. 

The engineer, however, wanted something unique for his cabin. He had been an award-winning pole vaulter in college. He therefore built a set of poles with a crosspiece, and a mulched run. He bought a new carbon fiber vaulting pole, new shoes, and was set. 

He would set off down the run, plant his pole, soar over the crosspiece, and land in the river with a satisfying splash. What a great way to spend a hot afternoon. He tried to teach a few friends to vault, with no success.
 
He enjoyed his cabin for years, and went out early in the spring one year. It had been a very wet winter, lots of rain afterward. When the family arrived, the river was up and flowing at a good clip, with twice the usual current flowing. 

The engineer was determined to enjoy a few vaults into the water, although his wife didn't think it was safe. But he was a good swimmer and proceeded to have a go at it. 

His run and jump were flawless, he hit the water in good form, but upon surfacing, he was swept downstream and disappeared. His body was found later that day, tangled in streamside debris. 

It was a sad end for the engineer and the family sold the cabin, with no desire to return to the scene of such tragedy. 

Our lamented engineer was a civil engineer. Had he consulted one of his electrical engineer brethren, he would have been warned that ""It's not vaultage that kills you, it's the current!""","There once was a young engineer,",2747

Trump: “This has to be the worse deal in the history of deals,...we were also a part of finding you here okay...so we should get a wish each!”

Santa was bedridden with a nasty stomach bug, and his workshop was short-staffed as many of the elves had contracted ~~herpes from sodomizing each other~~ the flu. Santa's factory was a week behind schedule, understaffed and poorly managed with Santa being ill.

 As the clock ticked closer and closer to midnight, Mrs. Claus took it upon herself to see that something would be done to keep Christmas alive. Being behind schedule, Mrs. Claus took it upon herself to ensure that every child that had been on the nice list that year would get the presents they wished for.

She started working fervorously, and calling in all of the favors she had from her good deeds throughout the years. Soon enough, every being she had helped was in the workshop, doing the elves' jobs. As midnight approached nearer and Mrs. Claus and her crew got closer to finishing the final items on the list, Mrs. Claus fetched Santa and fixed him some hot cocoa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unbeknownst to them, a now well practiced tradition was about to commence for the very first time. Most of Mrs. Claus' workers had finished their tasks and gone home, but there was one thing left to do before Santa would go deliver the presents to all of the children that had behaved that year: put up a tree. Santa, still out of it from his illness, had lost track of the tasks that needed to be done and had put all of his faith in Mrs. Claus to make sure Christmas would survive another year. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 11:59 PM, just before Santa's sleigh would take off as the yearly routine goes, Santa realized he confused the naughty list with the nice list. The last of Mrs. Claus' workers, an angel, approached Santa prior to his departure carrying Santa's favorite Evergreen that he had been taking care of the last century. With the seconds ticking down and the angel approaching, Santa was fixated on the tree. How could she cut down his favorite tree? She had no right! 

&amp;#x200B;

The angel, somehow unable to sense Santa's anger approached him and asked, ""Santa, I've gotten you the most magnificent tree in the North Pole, where do you want me to put it?""

&amp;#x200B;

And thus, we are left with the tradition of putting the angel on the top of the tree.

His wife was concerned but he waved her away, called off work, took a laxative, ate a hearty meal, and went back to sleep.

The next day the carpenter went to get up again, before being hit by even worse abdominal pain. Still having not gone to the toilet he decided something had to be done, and went next door to his friend the Farmer to borrow a horse laxative. He called off work, took the laxative, reassured his wife he'd go to the doctor if he didn't improve, ate a hearty meal, and went back to sleep.

That next day he woke up with crippling abdominal pain so bad he could barely move. He dragged himself to the doctors, only to have the Doctor not believe him. ""My good man,"" the Doctor said, ""there's no way a simple lack of bowel movement could cause pain this great. It must be something more."" Rebuffed but furious the carpenter decided to prove to the doctor how wrong he was, and this time took the whole bottle of laxatives before falling asleep.

In the middle of the night the carpenter woke up with a deep rumbling in his stomach, and rushed to the toilet, making it with seconds to spare. His belly gurglings were so loud they woke up the entire household, and as he crouched over the toilet bowl the floodgates opened and he pinched the fattest loaf of his life. The turd was so large it barely fit in the toilet bowl, but the invigorated yet still pained carpenter was ecstatic. ""Ha! I'll show the Doctor,"" he thought, ""there's no way this turd wasn't the source of my pain. I say, its larger than my cat!"". Thus said, he scraped up the offending article and drove off down to the clinic.

The carpenter smugly presented his prize to the Doctor, expecting astonishment. He was shocked however, when the Doctor didn't even blink.

""Well?"", said the watchful Carpenter, ""won't you admit you were wrong all along about my bowel movements?""  
""Not at all"", said the Doctor. ""Indeed, are you not still in pain?""  
""Ah, well... that is to say... yes,"" admitted the shamefaced Carpenter.  
""Well then,"" said the now self-satisfied Doctor. ""Don't you know? A good workman never blames his stools.""

Desperately wanting to, um, spend the night with Santa, the woman takes off her nightgown.

“Santa, pleeeeeeeease stay?”

“Ho ho ho! Gotta go, gotta go! Gotta deliver presents to all the children I know!”

Just before Santa packs up and climbs back up the chimney, the woman takes off her underwear, standing completely naked in front of old Saint Nick.

“How about now Santa?” She said, with a grin.

Santa looks her up and down and after a minute responds, “Hey hey hey! Gotta stay, gotta stay! Can’t go up the chimney with a boner in the way!”

The first day on the job, Jimmy bought a bunch of Detroit Lions Jerseys for the sheep. This took almost all of the money he had, but he really wanted to make his uncle laugh. Unfortunately, Dave did not find the stunt very funny. ""JIM! WHAT IS THIS! THEY HATE THE LIONS!"" Jimmy wasn't sure how a bunch of sheep could hate a sports team, but this was not the time to argue with his uncle.

The second day. Jimmy pulled a similar stunt. He bought a dozen Vikings jerseys. He had to dig into his college savings to get the cash. Once again, Uncle Dave was furious. ""JIM! WHAT IS THIS! THEY HATE THE VIKINGS EVEN MORE"" and Jimmy was forced to cut his losses and take the jerseys off.

It was the third day, but Jimmy did not give up. He bought even more jerseys, this time for the Chicago Bears. He even stole the money from his parents to buy them.  If you thought Dale was mad before, this was a whole new level. ""JIM! WHAT THE F*** DID YOU DO! THEY HATE THE BEARS MORE THAN ANY TEAM IN THE WHOLE WORLD!"" But Jimmy wasn't taking this shit anymore. He had worked way too hard to be treated like this. ""WELL WHAT F***ING TEAM DO YOUR DUMBA** SHEEP LIKE THEN!"" He yelled back. ""ISN'T IT OBVIOUS, JIM!""

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a slum with no memory with how he got there.,26

He was amused enough to drive along side it for a while, as he was driving he noticed the chicken was running 30 mph.

Pretty fast chicken, he thought, I wonder just how fast it can run. So he sped up and the chicken did too! They were now moving along the road at 45 mph!

The man in the car sped up again, to his surprise the chicken was still running ahead of him at 60 mph!!!

Suddenly the chicken turned off the road and ran down a long driveway leading to a farmhouse. The man followed the chicken to the house and saw a man in the yard with dozens of three legged chickens. The man in the car called out to the farmer ""How did you get all these three legged chickens?""

The farmer replied, ""I breed 'em. Ya see it's me, my wife and my son living here and we all like to eat the chicken leg. Since a chicken only has two legs, I started breeding this three legged variety so we could all eat our favorite piece.""

""That's amazing!"" said the driver ""How do they taste?""

""Don't rightly know, I ain't caught one yet!""

She went over to strike up a conversation with him.  Though she was pushing 40, she was very attractive, and she could tell this barely 21-year-old man was into her.  So she suggested that they go back to her place.  The young man eagerly agreed.

When they got there, they ripped off their clothes and fell onto the bed.  ""Let's do 69!"" shouted the woman.

""I don't know what that is,"" said the man.

""I'll show you,"" and she straddled his face and began giving him oral sex.  After a short while, the margaritas and bean dip had their way with her intestines, and she let out a loud and incredibly smelly fart.

The young man was gasping for air, and the woman apologized profusely.  She straddled his face once more, but after only a few seconds let out another ghastly fart.

The young man had tears streaming down his face as he gasped for breathable air again.  The woman was thoroughly embarrassed, and apologized even more.  For a third time, she straddled his face, and had barely resumed fellating him when she again farted.

This time, the young man pushed her off of him and began to get dressed.

I have been unable to sleep since I broke off your engagement to my daughter. Will you forgive and forget?

I was much too sensitive about your Mohawk, tattoo and pierced nose. I now realize motorcycles aren't really that dangerous, and I really should not have reacted that way to the fact that you have never held a job.

I am also very sure that some other very nice people live under the bridge in the park, too. Sure my daughter is only 18 and wants to marry you instead of going to Harvard on a full scholarship. After all, you can't learn everything about life from books.

I sometimes forget how backward I can be. I was wrong. I was a fool. I have now come to my senses and you have my full blessing to marry my daughter. 
  
Sincerely, 
Your future father-in-law.

But this was really too noisy for the tournament room, so the tournament director told them to take it outside. They did, but the only space available was in the hotel lobby. So they set up their sets there, and it became a normal way of passing the time after a round.

Another visitor to the hotel pointed out to the manager that it was pretty noisy, but he said he liked it because it was so ""Christmasy"". 

""Christmasy?"" came the reply, ""Just how is this Christmasy?""

A depressed young woman from a Manhattan finishing school was so desperate that she decided to end her life by throwing herself into the ocean. When she went down to the docks, a handsome young sailor noticed her tears, took pity on her, and said, “Look, you’ve got a lot to live for. I’m off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I’ll take good care of you and bring you food every day.”

Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, “I’ll keep you happy, and you’ll keep me happy.” 

The girl nodded. What did she have to lose?

That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love until dawn.

Three weeks later, during a routine search, she was discovered by the captain.

“What are you doing here?” he asked.

“I had an arrangement with one of the sailors,” she explained. “He’s taking me to Europe, and every night he came and screwed me.”

“He sure did, lady,” said the captain. “This is the Staten Island Ferry.”",Stowaway story,14

Soon thereafter, Mom sent out her Thank You notes. She wrote:

""Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home, I have my groceries delivered, so I never use the Mercedes...and the driver is a Nazi. A million thanks.""

He really liked this TV and he wanted to buy it. Since his dad was very rich, he knew he could purchase it no matter what. So heads up to the store owner and asks him, ""How much for that TV?"" The store owner says, ""That TV is not for sale."" The kid says, ""Hey money is no big deal. Whatever you want, I'll pay for it!"" The store owner says, ""That TV is not for sale."" The kid, now very angry, replies ""My dad owns so many famous buildings in New York! Do you know who he is? You should sell this TV to me!"". The shopkeeper, still calm, replies, ""When you're an adult and you own the buildings, come back and then we'll talk about it.""

&amp;#x200B;

The kid grows up and takes over his dad's business. Still he has that gaping hole in his heart, he really wants that TV he couldn't buy. He takes a drive down that area and sees that the shop is still there. He walks in, and sees the shopkeeper and walks up to him, ""Hey man! You remember me? I had come to buy that TV all those years ago. I now own all the buildings that my dad had. I have now many buildings named after me too. Now can I buy it?"" The shopkeeper looks at him and says, ""Yeah! I remember you! Wow, you've grown so much. But you still can't have the TV."" Now the man is furious, ""You know I could buy out the store and take that TV from you by force! I'm a real-estate mogul now!"" The shopkeeper, calmly replies, ""You want that TV so much? Come back when I can see you on it, and we'll talk then.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man starts his own reality TV show. He fires anyone at will, demonstrating power. But that TV is still out of reach from him and leaves him feeling empty. He checks online and sees the store is still there and walks in. ""I'm a TV star now! Hand me that TV! You promised!"" The shopkeeper looks at him, with a calm gaze, ""You know what? I never promised. I said we'd talk about it."" The man replies, ""Well now I'm a TV star! A celebrity! I deserve that TV!"" The shopkeeper replies ""Well even if you're the ruler of the land, I can't sell you that TV!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now this man determined to get that TV back, runs for President. Even with no political experience, he becomes the President. When he is sworn in, he looks at the crowd that's gathered to see him, but he still doesn't feel fulfilled. It was his childhood dream, that TV. The one that got away. He's done so much in his life, but it still feels so empty. This time, with a presidential motorcade and the secret service, he walks up to the shopkeeper and says ""Now I'm the ruler of the land! Hand me that TV."" The shopkeeper says ""Well technically the president is not a rul...."" ""CUT THE BULLSHIT! AND HAND ME THE TV NOW!"" yells the man, his childhood disappointment emerging like tyrannical rage.

The man stares at him, takes a deep breath and yells, ""I CAN'T SELL YOU THAT TV YOU DUMBASS! BECAUSE IT'S A MICROWAVE!!""

They realize two of them have to sleep outside. After much argument the women would sleep in the tent and the men would sleep under the stars.

A couple of hours later a group of Native Americans on patrol find the men sleeping and beat them senseless, leaving the women alone. Startled, the men wake up their girlfriends screaming they were beat up by Native Americans. The women dismissed it and told them to go back to sleep. A couple of hours after that the patrol, believing the men didn't learn their lesson, stormed the campground and beat the men senseless again. The men wake up their girlfriends in a panic screaming they were beat up. One of the women said that they didn't believe they were beat up and to prove there weren't any Native Americans beating people up they would switch places.

then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all they  were scattered

frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum when he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.

in his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.

he went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.

just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa
marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

the angel said very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful
tree for you. where would you like me to stick it?""

After the community sing-along led by Alice at the piano, it was time for the star of the show -Claude the Hypnotist!

 

Claude explained that he was going to put the whole audience into a trance.

 

""Yes, each and every one of you and all at the same time,"" said Claude.

 

The excited chatter dropped to silence as Claude carefully withdrew from his waistcoat pocket, a beautiful antique gold pocket watch and chain.

 

""I want you to keep your eyes on this watch,"" said Claude, holding the watch high for all to see.

 

""It's a very special and valuable watch that has been in my family for six generations,"" said Claude.

 

He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting,

 

""WATCH THE WATCH --- WATCH THE WATCH ---- WATCH THE WATCH.""

 

The audience became mesmerised as the watch swayed back and forth.

 

The lights were twinkling as they were reflected from its gleaming surfaces.

 

A hundred and fifty pairs of eyes followed the movements of the gently swaying watch.

 

They were hypnotised.

 

And then suddenly, the chain broke!

 

The beautiful watch fell to the stage and burst apart on impact.

 

""SHIT,"" said Claude.

 

It took them three days to clean the Senior Citizens Centre.

There once was a brave sailor with a very small crew on a very small ship. One day, while they were fishing, a ship filled with pirates was on the way to pillage the small fishing ship. The first mate, worried about what was to come, informed the captain about the pirate ship. 

""Captain! There's a ship filled with armed pirates! We have to surrender!""

""No!"" The captain said. ""Fetch me my red shirt, and we will fight back!""

The first mate, despite being confused, had faith in the captain, and hence fetched the red shirt. The captain put it on, and they went to battle. The crew fought valiantly, and surprisingly, they won!

A few weeks passed of peaceful fishing, until one day, another pirate ship appeared. Even bigger than the last! The first mate, yet again warned the captain.

""Captain!! There's no way we can beat them! Their ship is way too big!""

""No!"" The captain bellowed. "" Fetch me my red shirt, and we will fight back.""

The first mate reluctantly agreed, and off they went to battle. Surprisingly, they won the fight again!

The first mate, impressed but also confused by these events, confronted the captain.

""How do we manage to win every fight? Does it have something to do with the red shirt?""

The captain replied. ""Oh, you see, I wear the red shirt so that when I am wounded, our crew doesn't see me bleed, making them more confident in me, helping us win the fights!""

The first mate was impressed. His captain was so brave! Hence he no longer felt any doubt in his captain.

A few months passed after these events, until one day, and entire fleet of pirates arrived, all ready to pillage the small ship. The first mate, already mentally prepared for this, told the captain.

""Would you like me to fetch you your red shirt?""

""No."" The captain replied. ""Fetch me my brown pants.""

There was little food in Town, and Steel has more food than the rest of Town combined.

Everyone wanted some of Steel’s food, just enough so that they wouldn’t starve. But Steel didn’t want to share. He wanted all the food he could possibly have.

One day, a small group gathered around outside Steel’s house.

“We need to pay Steel a visit” one said.

“We should steal his food while we’re at it” another one said.

“No,” said a man who hated Steel more than anyone. “We should eat him.”

“What?” some people said. “Eat Steel? That would be cannibalism!”

“Steel needs to pay for his sins.” some other people said. They took a vote, and the majority went with eating Steel. The plan was set. 5 people would run it, taking a body part of him and then running out. It was a bad plan.

Night came fast, so they set the plan in motion. They got in and took 5 body parts from Steel. But because it was so dark, they decided to tell each other what they had taken.

At the end of the first week at the construction site the foreman gave her an envelope with $10 inside as her pay. The girl brought the envelope home to show her mother who suggested they take her “pay” to the bank to start a savings account. When they got to the bank and up to the teller she became as equally impressed as the mother and asked how a girl her age could have come by a paycheck. The little girl proudly replied “ I worked with a real construction crew who is building the house next door to us.” “Oh my goodness gracious” replied the teller “will you be working with them next week too?” The little girl replied “I will, but only if those assholes at Lowe’s deliver the fucking Sheetrock on time.”

At he gets closer he sees it's the outline of a blonde woman sitting in a beach chair near the water. He walks up behind her about to ask her what the matter was. Before he says anything, he notices that she doesn't have any arms or legs. Thinking it's a bit weird, he still decides to see what was wrong.

""Why are you crying"" he asks the young lady.

""Nobody likes me. I came here on a date with a boy I met online, but after one look at me he just left. My best friend dropped me off, but she won't be back for another couple hours. I have nowhere to go and I'm stranded."" sobbed the woman.

The man felt very bad for this young lady. Besides her missing arms and legs, she was actually pretty good looking. After talking a little more with her she makes a confession.

""I'm so pathetic. I've never even been kissed before"" she cried.

The man thinks to himself and looks around. There is nobody else within view on the beach. He thought, what the heck. He leans over and gives the woman the most passionate kiss he could. Her crying stopped momentarily as she thanked him. However, she started crying shortly after.

""I'm so pathetic. No boy has ever tried to feel me up."" she cried.

The man started getting a little more weirded out, but again there wasn't anyone looking. She did have very nice breasts, so I decided what the heck. He grabbed as her large and tender breasts and played with them for a little while. After a few minutes he stopped, and she seemed a little happier. After a few seconds she starts crying even harder than before.

""I'm so pathetic. Nobody wants to fuck me!""

The guy is slightly annoyed at how much this girl is droning on. But he has gone this far, so he might as well go all the way. He picks her up in his arms and carries her down the beach looking for a good spot. Her tears stop and finally a smile moves across her face. The man whispers to her in a seductive hushed tone.

""You ready?"" he asked?

She nods.

With one swift movement he throws her into the ocean.

""There"" he yells, ""Now you're fucked!""",A man walking down the beach heard a woman crying... (NSFW),74

A young man called Chris from London wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. 

They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Scotland. Chris consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. 

Off he went with his sister to Harrods and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Chris unknowingly got the knickers. Good old Chris sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter. 

Dear Maggie,
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). 

These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. 

I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. 
I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.
When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.
Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.
All my love,
Chris
P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",BEST JOKE IVE HEARD IN AGES 😂😂😂😂😂...,7

The next evening, since no one complained, he’s still the cook. This time, he deliberately makes the meals as horrible as possible. He burns the bread, he leaves the soup cold, he over-seasons the meal, the works. However, no one complains because no one wants to cook.

We've heard colleagues referring to people with ""Guts"", or with ""Balls"". Do they, however,

know the difference between them?  


 
Here's the official distinction, straight from the British Medical Journal: Volume 323; page 295:


GUTS - Is arriving home late, after a night out with the lads, being met by your wife with a broom,

and having the ""Guts"" to ask: ""Are you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?""


 
BALLS - Is coming home late after a night out with the lads, smelling of perfume and beer,

lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the bum and having the ""Balls"" to say:

“You're next, Chubby”.


I trust this clears up any confusion.

 
Medically speaking, there is no difference in outcome; both are fatal.

As she lay her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the Vet shook his head sadly and said, ""I'm so sorry, Polly has passed away."" 
  
The distressed owner wailed, ""Are you sure? I mean, you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 
  
The vet rolled his eyes, shrugged, turned and left the room returning a few moments later with beautiful black Labrador. As the bird's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the dead parrot from top to bottom. He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 
  
The vet led the dog out but returned a few moments later with a cat. The cat jumped up and also sniffed delicately at the ex-bird. The cat sat back, shook its head, meowed and ran out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry; but like I said, your parrot is most definitely, 100% certifiably ...dead."" 
  
He then turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman. The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried. ""$150 just to tell me my bird is dead?!"" 
  
The vet shrugged. ""If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would only have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, what did you expect?"" ",So a woman brought a very limp parrot into a veterinary hospital,623

Scottish widow says “Duncan did say he was getting a bit bored of Jam, but I didn’t realise he hated it that much, I just wish he’d have let me know how he really felt.”

post,a8tioq,2qh72,jokes,false,1545558307,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a8tioq/the_voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"A man enters a sex shop, looking for a new toy to keep his wife busy while he goes on business trips. As a higher-up in his corporation, he tends to be away from home several times a month, and wants to ensure his wife stays faithful.

When he reaches the counter, he's shocked to see an old, wizened man tending it. He asks, nervously: ""Do you work here?""

He replied ""Yes, I do"".

Still stupified by this mystical old man, the husband stammers...I uh...uh..am looking for something for my wife. My work requires me to travel and I wan't something that can keep her satisfied so she won't cheat on me.

The old man blinks slowly a few times, then says: ""Yes, I believe we have what you're looking for."" He pulls out a wooden box, covered in dust. It looks ANCIENT. As he opens the lid, the smell of old wood floods the husband's nostrils.

This here is a Voodoo dick. It has magical powers and I assure you, it would keep any women satisfied.

The husband laughs harder than he has in a long time. ""Did you say VOODOO dick? HAHAHAHA I can't believe you're trying to sell me this sh*t"".

The old man just looks at him. ""Allow me to demonstrate to quash your doubts, I suggest you stand away from the door.""

The husband looks behind him, and with a quizzical look on his face, takes three steps away from the door he was leaning against.

The old man speaks. ""VOODOO DICK, The door!""

All of a sudden, the gnarled, wooden shaft lying dormant inside the box floats into the air. It levels off with the doorknob, then soars through the air directly at the keyhole.

A thunderous bang bang bang can be heard as the voodoo dick tries violently to enter the hole that is far too small for it. The door starts to shake and hinges rattle.

The man says I'LL TAKE IT!!!!!

The old man then says VOODOO DICK, the box!

And as if on rewind, it slowly glides back into the box, and lay still.

Upon arriving home, his wife asks him what he has in the box. ""It's a voodoo dick, honey"", he says. The wife starts dying of laughter. ""Voodoo dick? hahahahaha you must be joking!!""

The husband gives her a stern look and says: ""Listen, I know how lonely you get on those business trips of mine, and this will keep you occupied so I know you'll be faithful.""

He then says: ""Voodoo dick, her pussy!"" The lid of the box bursts open as the dick flies through the air, directly towards his wife's crotch. There is the definitive sound of her panties ripping as the dick penetrated through the fabric, into it's designated spot.

The wife: ""What the he....hey....ooooo...mmm...oh...my...god...!!!!"" She is shaking on the couch.

The husband smiles and says, see you later honey, I'm going golfing with some pals from work!.

She is too busy biting her lips to respond.

Three hours pass.

Finally, decided she's been satiated, the wife tries to remove the dick from inside her. She pulls, tugs at it with all her might, but it won't budge. The thing remains inside her and refuses to move.

She panics.

She sees her husband's cellphone on the living room table. He forgot it. And he didn't tell her how to turn the thing off!

With the voodoo dick still thrusting inside her, the wife runs to the garage and starts the car. She has to get to a hospital. She's freaking out.

12 minutes later, she is pulled over by a traffic cop for doing nearly double the speed limit. He asks her why she felt she needed to risk her life and the life of others by speeding. He thinks she's on drugs, because she's not talking coherently.

Officer...oh...ahh...see...uh..my husband bought this....voodoo dick...for me and it won't come out!!..And oohhhhhh.......ahh...he didn't tell me how to turn it off! He's gone..golfing with his friends...and I can't...get a hold..of him.

The officer looks at her with a blank expression on her face.

He bursts out laughing.

""Hahahahaha, that's a new one! Never heard that one before! Voodoo dick, my ass!""",The Voodoo Dick,358

The Spanish is first to be lashed and requests a bottle of tequila and a pillow strapped to his back. They let him drink the tequila and strap the pillow to his back and then commence the lashes. After 5 lashes the pillow breaks and they keep lashing him. After the 20 lashes he's bawling and his back is horribly scarred. They haul him away to be sent back to Spain.

The French man is next and he requests two pillows (one per request). After 10 lashes the pillows break and they continue with the next 10. By the end he's also horribly scarred and bawling, but not as bad as the Spanish guy.

While they are hauling off the French guy the judge turns to the Brit and says ""Well it's your turn now. What do you request?""

The British man responds ""First I want the original punishment of 100 lashes. I don't believe I should get off easy.""

He's about to put the furball out of its misery when the rabbit says:

""Wait!! I'm a magic bunny! If you free me and let me go, I'll grant you one wish"".

The cowboy is surprised but he already knows what he wants and won't miss this chance. He gets off his horse and starts freeing the rabbit as he says:

""Awrite ya lil critter, ya got yerself a deal. I have the darnedest luck with the ladies on account of my small... attributes down there. I want the same privates as this here horse, then yer free to go"".

The now free rabbit wipes the dust off its fur and says: ""Whoa, that's sure to startle any human lass. Easy."" The bunny casts its spell and hops off. ""Now if you'll excuse me...""

The cowboy already feels the difference; he rushes home and pulls his pants down excitedly in front of a big mirror.

""Son of a gun!"" Yells the cowboy, while he slams his hat on the floor. ""Ah just HAD to ride the damn mare today!"".

There was one man who was greeted cheerfully by everyone. Like really everyone. His name was John. Boss stopped him for a while and asked him a question 'John, how is it possible that our accountant, manager, supplier and even our new clients who were here for the first time they all know you?'. 'Well boss..', he replied 'I'm worldwide known and everyone knows who I am'. 'This is some damn joke' boss thinks 'but let's check this out'. 'If it's true you will get a promotion but if it's not you will clean my office for a week, deal?'. 'Ok, boss' John replied. Few seconds later boss said 'I'm sure you have not met Arnold Schwarzeneger so we go to California and see if you are telling the truth'.
After a short fly and taxi drive they visited California's governor - Arnold Schwarzeneger. 'Hello John, high five, how are you? When was the last time you were here?' 'Who knows Arnie, 2 years maybe?' Boss was shocked. After a while he said to John 'Well, you might know him but I'm 100% sure you do not know Lionel Messi'. John replied 'He's my longtime buddy'. So to check if this is truth they took a flight to Barcelona, Spain.
Flight was few hours longer then before but they reached the Camp Nou stadium where players had their training. 'Sup Leo, we have not had any sparring last time, have we?' asked John and they had one hour talk about their relationship. 'Damn you John. Last person. I'm positive you do not know current Pope - Francis. 'Boss, let's fly to Vatican and you will see on your own eyes'.
After reaching St Peter's Square John said to his boss 'I'm going inside and after 20 minutes me and Pope will wave at you from the balcony'. John did as he had promised. When he was going back he saw an ambulance and his boss inside. 'Boss, what happened?!' he asked. 
'John...' he barely said. 'I can believe that you know Arnold Schwarzeneger. Hell, I can even stand that you and Messi play football together. But when some 10-year old boy came when you were on the balcony with Pope and asked 'Who the f#@k is that old geezer standing next to John?!' my heart couldn't take it'.
