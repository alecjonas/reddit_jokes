Second day of isolation: - my apartment is really cool and cozy - I have a 5 star family: my wife is sweet and the kids are cool - the neighbours are the best. 

Third day of isolation: - kids wake up very early - my wife snores - I really loved the breakfast she made but I didn't really understood what she meant by ""this is not a hotel"" - the neighbors are a little strange. 

Fourth day isolation: - the stupid kids already took two slaps each, they are two terrorists - the girl has also started to talk shit - I went to take out the trash, someone had disinfected the elevator with bleach. I pressed the buttons with the my stumps. 

Fifth day of isolation: - kill me - I'd rather catch the virus than to be in this hell - there's no more booz, suicide seems the best solution - the witch won't let go - I suspect the kids are not mine - the upstairs neighbours didn't give me a roll of toilet paper, scrooges.

 Tenth day of isolation: - alcohol and tobacco deprivation makes me hallucinate - my wife and I are much better since she barricaded herself in the bedroom - I gave the kids for adoption - the neighbors are a bunch of motherfuckes.",Quarantine,1

Honestly, I don’t remember why we started fighting. But, for this occasion, we were playfully fighting and then I punched him a little too hard. Slowly each punch had increasing strength. We threw about twenty at each other. Then I tackled him to the ground and held him down with my fist. I usually stopped when I heard crying. My mom ran in and tried to figure out what happened. She was too late. It was over. Now I am just standing above my brother and he is crying on the ground.  As the victor, I got punished. 

So my mom grabbed her wooden spoon from the kitchen to spank me. She made me pull down my pants and lay on her lap with my head and feet sprawling over. After the first hit, I started chuckling. So the second hit came even harder making me laugh. On the third hit, you crack. The spoon splintered in the middle. She decided to stop because she was afraid she actually hurt me. But I just laughed at her face. I did have some welts from it but my butt is so bony so it already hurts to sit on it.

I am fourteen years old and I am in the upstairs bathroom of my parent's apartment. To give reference I just learned about masturbation. So I have been masturbating about every day for a year. Around this time you start exploring other things you can do to jack yourself off. 

I would switch to my left hand because it felt like someone else was touching my dick. But I quickly learned that I did like to know that I was touching my dick and having the same grip strength I had been tuning for the past year with my right hand. I got good at jerking myself off. 

I had to try jacking off with my left hand to start to enjoy it. But the problem was I could only enjoy my left hand or my right hand in one session. I couldn’t switch hands during a session because it didn’t feel right. But, not even that I would have to retrain each hand over several times to enjoy it again. Many times leaving me blue. 

But, knowing that I am the one jacking off myself I start to think about what other parts of my body I could use. So sitting buck naked on the toilet I checked if my mouth could reach my tip. Part of my dick was very easy to reach because it got a little with stretch then the rest of them. But that is not what I wanted. With a little readjustment of my body, I was able to get my mouth over the tip and get a few inches deep. I can confirm you aren’t missing much. 

It just feels like there is something wet in your mouth. But not sure if your mouth is wet or your dick is wet. I only tried it a few times, never enjoying it. But it gave me a benchmark of how a blow job would feel. 

My first girlfriend was definitely on par.",I have learned a new metric of flexibility.,0

They made a deal, if the men found 5 of the same fruit and came back with it, they would let them go. So the men go and find their fruits in the jungle. The first man comes back with 5 apples, and before they let him go, they say he has to fit them all up his arse without making a sound, otherwise, they would kill him. He got two up there but made a sound putting the third one up and they killed him. He looked down on the tribal village from the heavens and saw the second man come back with 5 grapes. He watched him get told what to do and start putting them up his arse, without any difficulty. Just as the second man was putting the 4th grape in, he let out a laugh and got killed. The first man met up with him in the heavens and asked why he made a sound because he could've lived. Then the second man tells him that he saw the last man coming back with pineapples.

“What kind of rule is that? Why would I buy dog food if I didn’t have a dog?” Angry but unable to resist the cheap price, the man had to go back home and bring his dog to the supermarket.

A few days later, the man went to the supermarket again for some cat food, but he met the same cashier who insisted that he prove he had a cat. So again he went back home and brought his cat.

When he needed to make a purchase from the supermarket for the third time, he knew what to do, so he brought a box to the cashier. 

“What do you want to buy this time?”
“Just feel what’s in the box and you’ll know.”
The cashier put one hand in the box but couldn’t figure out what it is. “So what exactly do you want to buy?”

In all their 30 years of marriage, Ruth never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and £81,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents.

That evening they were out for a special Anniversary dinner. After dinner, Ruth could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, *“I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”*
… 
Eamonn thought for a while and said, *“I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”*

Ruth was shocked, but said, *“Hmmm,  Fiona Phillips, Penny Smith and Holly Willoughby. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behaviour. However, since you are addicted to sex, I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”*

Eamonn thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace.

A little while later Ruth asked *""Eamonn, so why do you have all that money in the box?""*

Eamonn answered; *“Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling centre and redeemed them for cash”*",Box under the bed,144

As the ravens mature, they will stake off on their own to find a mate, convening into groups only when large amounts of food are present-- a dead elk, for instance. 

We are able to attribute the reason ravens do leave these groups to being stressed out from large groups. Scientists have found that there are elevated levels of corticosterone in the stool of group living ravens compared to the stool of solo/monogamous ravens.

So in short, *Corvus corax* hormones-- mostly corticosterone-- denote bemoaning a more robust aloneness, but condone courting a consort, and forming a home to call ones own.",Some facts about Ravens,0

As the man gaped in astonishment, the genie told him ""Since you have summoned me, I will grant you three wishes. One warning though: Anything you wish for, your ex will get twice as much"".

Getting over his astonishment quickly, the man decided to make the most of it. ""Okay, for my first wish, I want $10 billion"". The genie snaps his fingers and says ""done"", and immediately the man pulls out his cellphone and calls his bank, who confirms he has a $10 billion balance in his account. Meanwhile, his ex has decided to go on a shopping spree with her unexpected windfall of $20 billion dollars.

The man then makes his next wish. ""I wish I had a Lamborghini"". The genie snaps his fingers and says ""done"" and a brand-new Lamborghini appears. Meanwhile his ex is astonished when she finds two gorgeous Lamborghini at her house when she arrives home from her shopping trip.

""You have one wish left"" said the genie. ""What will it be?"" The man thinks for a few minutes and then smiles. ""I wish to donate one of my kidneys"".",A slight variation of an old joke,8

He handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass.

As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000 and asked the little man what he did for a living. Was he a lumberjack, or a weightlifter, or what?

""I work for the IRS.""",The local bar was so sure that it's bartender was the strongest man around that they had a standing $1000 bet,385

She had long been suspicious of a relationship between Ben and his roommate and this only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Ben and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom’s thoughts, Ben volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Allison and I are just roommates.”

About a week later, Allison came to Ben and said, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. “You don’t suppose she took it, do you?”

Ben said, “Well, I doubt it, but I’ll write her a letter just to be sure.”

So he sat down and wrote: “Dear Mother, I’m not saying you ‘did’ take a gravy ladle from my house, and I’m not saying you ‘did not’ take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.”

Several days later, Ben received a letter from his mother which read:

“Dear Son, I’m not saying that you ‘do’ sleep with Allison, and I’m not saying that you ‘do not’ sleep with Allison. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom”",Ben invited his mother over for dinner,12

In summary, the police arrested Patrick Lawrence, 22 year old white male, in a pumpkin patch 12.01 a.m. on Friday.

On Monday, at the Gwinnett County (GA) courthouse, Lawrence was charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication.

The suspect explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch on his way home from a drinking session when he decided to stop, 'You know how a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around for miles or at least I thought there wasn't anyone around' he stated in a telephone interview.

Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purpose, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged need. 'Guess I was really into it, you know?' he commented with evident embarrassment.

In the process of doing the deed, Lawrence failed to notice an approaching police car and was unaware of his audience until Officer Brenda Taylor approached him.

'It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,' said Officer Taylor. 'I walked up to Lawrence and he's just banging away at this pumpkin.' Officer Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence .

'I said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you're having sex with a pumpkin??'

He froze and was clearly very surprised that I was there, and then he looked me straight in the face and said... 'A pumpkin? Shit ... is it midnight already?'",Best Come Back Line Ever.',14

Over the next few months, they build a little community: all three craft little huts out of sticks and leaves, and they fairly split up all the tasks and chores essential to their survival. They even build a little church where they go to pray every Sunday.

But after a little while, everyone gets, well, restless. To be blunt, they're all horny and have no sexual outlets. Being devoutly religious people, pre-marital sex is out of the question.

So, they come up with a system. The woman marries one of the men for a week, then gets a divorce and marries the other man for a week. They just go back and forth like this. This way, each of the guys get seven days full of sex every other week, and the girl gets laid whenever she wants.

This situation works out great, and their three-person community is thriving. But after eight months of this, the woman gets bit by a poisonous snake and dies.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...",28684

walking home with her husband, Mrs. Smith, who was
about as innocent at forty as she had been at fifteen, said:

the finest thing in life, et.'""  ""Why,"" says Smith, ""he
meant the church."" ""Oh, yes!"" says Mrs. S.  ""Well,
now, that is a good toast.  I'll remember that.""

The next year the reunion was held at Smith's.  Some-
body suggested that the hostess offer the first toast.  Mrs.
Smith modestly expressed her lack in the matter of toasts,
and said that she would simply repeat an excellent toast
that had once been offered by Mr. Jones.  So she raised
her glass and repeated the same old sentiment:  ""Here's
to the finest thing in life.  We all know where to find it.""
Of course everybody laughed, and Smith just laid back in
his chair and roared.  Mrs. Smith turned to him and said:

four times last year, and you went off each time before
service was out.""",Four young men went to college together...,0
