SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!

BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs.  No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs.  Period. 

JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.

HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road.

GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road.  We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not.  The chicken is either with us or against us.  There is no middle ground here.

DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?

COLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.

BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.

AL GORE: I invented the chicken.

JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it!  It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions.  I am not for it now, and will remain against it.

AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?

DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road.  What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.

OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly.  So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.

ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.

NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty!  You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.

PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.

MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going.  I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level.  No little bird gave me any insider information.

DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.

JERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay!  Can't you people see the plain truth?  That's why they call it the 'other side.'  Yes, my friends, that chicken was gay.  If you eat that chicken, you will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the Liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like 'the other side.'  That chicken should not be crossing the road.  It's as plain and as simple as that.

GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting?  In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish it's lifelong dream of crossing the road.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

JOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.

BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2013, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook.  Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2013.  This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?

COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",Why did the chicken cross the road?,19

The anthropologist denied ever being intimate with the woman.

Confronted with that simple fact, the anthropologist scrambled. He turned to a field where the tribe's sheep were grazing. He pointed to one black sheep among the white animals.

""See! Nature is abundant with diversity. Through a random mix of genetics, you get seemingly inexpiable variations in color. That's how a flock of white sheep could produce a black sheep.""

The leader paused. He looked at the black sheep and then back to the anthropologist.

""OK. I won't say anything about the white baby if you don't say anything about the black sheep.""

As I approached the entrance, there was nothing more amazing i'd seen in those last 2 weeks than the bouncer. He was buffed up at least 4 inches taller than me, had long hair, a braided beard, hell he looked like a viking. Surprisingly, he lets me in.  


Getting in, I noticed a girl standing alone. I approach her and we dance a little. She tels me her name is Sky and she's from Sweden. We dance a bit more, and after a while of her grinding on me, she notices my erection and smiles.   


She leads me to a bathroom and we enter a stall. She unzips my pants and starts going down on me. She was so good I came in less than a minute. She giggles and takes of her pants, motioning for me to eat her out. After a few minutes, she she shifts and now her ass in my face and i'm now giving her a rim job. She starts moaning loudly and pretty soon there's a knock on the door, and a booming voice shouts, ""OPEN THE DOOR!""   


I freak out and open the stall. It's the Nordic bouncer.

""What do you think you're doing in here?"", he asks  


I'm in a daze and stumble for words. He pushes past me and goes for the girl, bends her over and starts eating her ass. Shes moaning even louder now. I'm frozen in shock. I finally muster some courage and ask , ""What the fuck are you doing? she's my girl.""  


He turns to me and says:

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates."" 

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" 

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure."" 

He sat down and wrote : 

Dear Mother: 
I'm not saying that you 'did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Dear Son:

Two well-dressed ladies happened to start up a conversation during an endless wait in the Brisbane Airport Terminal.



The first lady was an arrogant Victorian married to a wealthy business man.

The second was a well-mannered elderly woman from Mount Isa, Queensland.



After a little while the Victorian woman started by saying,

""When my first child was born, my husband built a beautiful mansion for me.""



The lady from Mount Isa commented, ""Well, isn't that fantastic?""



The first woman continued,

""When my second child was born, my husband bought me a beautiful Mercedes-Benz.""



Again, the lady from Mount Isa commented, ""Well, isn't that fantastic?""



The first woman went on,

""Then, when my third child was born, my husband bought me this exquisite diamond bracelet.""





Yet again, the Mount Isa lady commented, ""Well, isn't that fantastic?""

The first woman then asked,

""What did your husband buy for you when you had your first child?""



""My husband sent me to charm school,"" declared the Mount Isa lady.

""Charm school?"" the first woman cried, ""Oh, my Lord! What could they teach you??""





The Mount Isa lady responded, ""Well as an example... instead of saying,

""Who gives a Fuck?"" I learned to say, ""Well, isn't that fantastic?""",Charm School,0

Pedro, a skinny Mexican teenager, worked at the local shoe store. Every day on his way home from work he passed the local brothel. Every day Maria, a homely 300 pound prostitute would hang her ample barely concealed breasts over the balcony and call to him. ""Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?"" Every day he would smile and turn red, but keep on walking. Finally one day she called to him, ""Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?"" and he sheepishly asked her how much it would cost. ""Only 10 pesos for you, Pedro,"" she called down. Pedro looked around, the street was empty, so he slipped in the door and went up to Maria's room. He knocked on the door, Maria opened it, and quickly enveloped him into her vast bulk.  For the next week, Pedro avoided Maria's street. Finally he walked past the brothel again on his way home from work. Maria was there on her balcony and called down to him. ""Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?"" Eyes wide, Pedro shook his head.

He simply had to hire this man to play at his club. He approaches the pianist:

""Sir, that was the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. I must ask, what was the name of that song?""
The pianist replies, ""Thank you! The name is, 'My Mom is a whore and my dad is a pimp.'""
The small club owner responds: ""What? Whatever, it's your song so you may name it as you please. Would you like to play at my bar tomorrow night? It pays well.""
The pianist ecstatically agreed to his offer.

The next night comes around and he does as he did the night before except this time at the small club owners place. He plays the piano so gracefully that the entire room is visibly weeping from its elegance. The song attracts the attention of the owner of the largest club in the city and asks him, ""My good sir, what is the name of that wondrous tune?"" 
""Oh that old thing? It's called, 'I met My Wife at a Family Reunion.'""
The big time club owner says, ""Erm...alright...anyways, I would love it if you played at my club this coming weekend. The pay is 10 times what it is here.""

The pianist, once again, ecstatically agrees.

Next weekend comes around and he plays at the renowned venue, moving everyone in attendance to gushing tears. He walks off the stage to use the restroom.

As he walks out of the restroom one of the bouncers approaches him and says, ""Sir, you do know, Your zippers undone and your dick is out?""

Being very attracted to the wizard and curious about his castle, she asks if she can come and see it.  The wizard pays the check and waves his wand.  They were then both instantly transported to the castle.  The woman was amazed at the grand scope of the castle and all of the wonders it contained.  

She dashed around between the exotic wonders and powerful artifacts.  However, she suddenly stops in front of the TV as she sees a peculiar set of blue, glowing eyes staring at the TV.  She asks the wizard, ""why do you have these eyes doing this?""  ""Oh!  Those are my TV eyes.""  The wizard noticed that the woman was confused and began to explain.  ""You see I have the unique ability to cast sets of eyes separate from my body and look through them at anytime.  So, if I'm waiting in line or doing something else incredibly dull, I can just start watching my TV in an instant.""  The woman remarks, ""that's incredible!  They also look quite lovely"".  The wizard continues, ""Not only that, but each set I make is specially fitted for a specific use.  These eyes remain perfectly still and process the images of a TV quite well.  I also have weather eyes that float in the sky to see what the weather will be, and collecting eyes that search the forests for rare herbs for me to collect later.""  

The two continue discussing the various magical wonders the wizard could perform, until the woman asks if she can stay over for the night.  The wizard sheepishly remakes ""well, I have a very important meeting tomorrow with the other local wizards, so I need a good nights rest.""  The woman remakes ""ok"" and is immediately transported to her apartment.  She begins getting ready to go to sleep, when she noticed a two tiny, red eyes staring at her from the window.  She rushes out to see what was going on, but by the time she gets out, the creature is gone.  

About a week later, she goes on another date with the wizard and asks him to go home with her.  Once again the wizard makes an obvious excuse to not and leaves.  That same night, the woman begins to take a shower, only to see the eyes staring at her again.  Only this time they are in her room not outside and it is obvious that they are one of the wizard's sets.  

In a rage the woman rushes to the wizard's castle to confront him.  Upon arriving, the wizard immediately apologizes explaining, ""I've wanted to spend the night with you ever since we first met, but unfortunately I am allergic to most condoms and have always been paranoid about STDs.  I was too embarrassed to ask you about it, so I sent my eyes to get a look at your lady bits to make sure you didn't have any.""  The woman was still furious, but understanding of the man's predicament.  She kisses him and said, ""You've got nothing to worry about.""  The two begin to get intimate, when the woman thinks of an interesting question, ""Why did you send THOSE eyes though?  They were so creepy.""  ""Well, I always use those eyes for this sort of investigating.""  ""Why?""  ""Because they're my private eyes.""

After ending up in the drug business to support his family, a deal went bad and he was shot, landing him in the hospital. The night his family arrived to check on him, the same shooter made his way to his room murdered his wife and three children and somehow managed to evade police..


Months after this incident, Charlie, the same chicken who was in the hospital and who had witnessed his family's murder- was finally released. 


Charlie was a shell of his former self. He had nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to. He took up alcohol abuse for some time, until realizing what truly had to be done. He began tracking down his family's killer, and with each day spent, he became closer and closer to discovering the dealer's whereabouts. 
One day, he finally figured out who it was. 
As he arrived at the killers' home, Charlie took one last deep breath, then stormed in. After fighting through many of the dealers' body-gaurds, Charlie finally reached the notorious drug dealing murderer, Albert Smith. 


As a bloody battle ensued, it was clear who the winner would be... Charlie staggered out of the destroyed home, bloodied, yet victorious, he realized something. All the tracking, all the killing, all the bloodshed he had created, was All. In. Vain. He realized that taking Alberts's life didn't, and wouldn't, bring his family back. Finding himself dumbfounded, he began to run. He headed down, through the fields to where the bad drug deal happened, almost a year ago now.


He took one last deep breath, gazed at the stars through tear-caked eyes and took his first step on the road. This was it he decided, he was finally going to reunite with his family again once more, for the final time. As the headlights raced towards him, he closed his eyes - wings outstretched, and heard his family whisper gently to him

As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut glass bowl sitting on top of it.The bowl was filled with water,and in the water floated of all things, a condom! When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat. The pastor
tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its
strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and he could no longer resist.
'Miss Beatrice', he said,
'I wonder if you would tell me about this? Pointing to the bowl.

post,3xglg8,2qh72,jokes,false,1450529326,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3xglg8/a_sensitive_guy/,self.jokes,,"A woman meets a man in a bar.
 
They talk; they connect; they end up leaving together.
 
They get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears.
 
There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!
 
It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.
 
There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.
 
She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him. 
 
They share a bottle of wine and
continue talking and,
 
After awhile, she finds herself
thinking, 
 
'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy
could be the one!
 
'Maybe he could be the future
father of my children?' 
 
She turns to him and kisses him
lightly on the lips.
 
He responds warmly.
 
They continue to kiss, the passion builds.
 
And he romantically lifts her in
his arms and carries her into his bedroom,
 where they rip off each other's
clothes and make hot, steamy love.

She is so overwhelmed that she
responds with more passion,
more creativity, more heat than she has ever known. 
After an intense, explosive night
of raw passion with this sensitive guy,  they are lying there together in the afterglow.
The woman rolls over, gently
strokes his chest and asks coyly, 

'Well, how was it?' 

The guy gently smiles at her,

Like, dark clouds and cockroaches and shit. And he's just sitting there randomly with 3 arms. He has 2 dementors as pets...

He really loved those dementors cause they kept him company from his dark mind, and the dementors have allloot of souls sucked up, cause, you know...they're fukn dementors.
They live and breath people's souls...Anyways.

Fukin Hitler walks in and is like, ""Nein!!!!! Nein!!!! and is mad at Voldemort. Like, he doesn't want to kill Voldemort, he's just annoyed cause he's so fukin depressing.
So then Stalin walks in and he's fukn pissed too
""Fukin Voldemort!""
and he drinks an entire bottle of the finest vodka and hurls it to the ground; shattering it into itty bitty pieces,
""Fukn Voldemort, you little bitch""
Then Osama walks in and does the whole screaming terrorist shit,""Allahlalalalalalalalalalalala!!!!!"" but he doesn't run towards Voldemort and blow up cause he can just use other terrorists to do that shit for him. Osama could feel Voldemort's pain, but he wanted the Dark Lord to use his feelings for great things and not be annoying.

Anyways so all the evil people of history come and you can get the picture. Pol, Ted, Kim, Cartman with a Hitler moustache, fuckin even Saddam Hussein comes and is like, ""Damn Voldemort, you be lookn kinda sexy right now. 'I wonder how warm his asshole is...hmm'"" *imagination*
ok.
so.
All the evil dudes are talking to each other and they're all agreeing that Voldemort is being a little bitch. But they can't kill him because of those fucking dementors. So randomly, Snape tries to reassure these bastards, ""You guys do realise you're already dead, right?...so the dementors can't steal your souls..."" but Evil can sense Evil and Snapes Evil meter was kind of low, so they offed him. Very easily.

Mao Zedingdong was especially mad, even though he appeared calm and happy outwardly, ""Just stop!.....No...No...don't you stare at me, nope...Voldy....come on you little fuck....don't be staring at me like that....don't be giving me the creep look!""
So when fukn Voldemort opens he's creepy ass eyes he just fukn....
man.
it's just so depressing thinking about Voldemort...
poor Voldy.
never got to kill Harry Potter. 
Some say there's an alternate universe where Voldemort conquered over all...
But he didn't.

Poor, poor, voldy.
The saddest creepiest little bitch anyone knew.....
But Voldemort never cried. He just thought really hard. Cause he was fuckin Smart! Like Satan.

Fukin Satan used to be all second in command to the universe and shit and empathised with poor little Voldy. Anyways that's WAY the fuck off topic to the joke but whatever.
so where was i...
i haven't even got to the punchline yet.
hmm...
let me just finish the joke.
fuck.
so!

While all this Shit is going on, there are these creepy green ghosts flying around and of course, the cockroaches.
Fukn Voldemort loved cockroaches because they reminded him of the biggest cocks in the world. And yes I am talking about roosters. Voldy loved to get up early in the morning with the roosters and watch the sun rise. This nigga stared at the sun until he went blind so, it was kind of understandable why Voldemort had some creepy eyes and yes, he was weird.

All the evil people are still upset. Very very mad at Voldemort. So they argued for generations. Millions of years. And then they had a random staring contest. But fuckn Voldemort always won because he stared at the sun all the time.
man.
i always get to the punchline.
But i'm feeling kind of sad for poor little voldy. I mean,
not depressingly cuz voldemort IS an annoying little bitch.
aaaanyways...
*sigh*
so yeah.
ok now im on the verge of repeating myself, fuck.

So then.........this guy...this fukin random ass guy shows up with a sword. Like what the fuck...seriously! He was legendary too, but Hitler and Stalin were confused because he was good. Fuckin Aragorn from Lord of the Rings starts flailing his sword around all epically and shit, and all the evil dudes know this niggas a fictional character. They're like, ""Seriously, how the fuck? What? Why are you here?"" 
And Aragorn be like, ""Dude! I need my army for the 3rd Lord of the Rings movie! Wanna come?"" Evil dudes: ""Fuck yeah!"" 

So Aragorn takes Hitler, all those motherfuckers, and the green ghosts to fight the orcs and shit and be all epic in the movie.

But they lived a fantasy. And fukn Voldemort had the courage to stare at the sun and go blind.
...and shit
so
Aragorn is gone, hitler is gone, Stalin.......
fuck man
Voldemort is depressed
And his poor dementors don't even know WHAT the fuck just happened. Voldy just stood there. Actually, he sat. Cause he liked to meditate. 
Fukn weird ass motherfucker.
so.
Voldy sat on his nice little pedestal and opened his eyes one last time. It was a stormy day in this dark place. Legends say God experiences times as if 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is a day. But fukn Voldermort? Time doesn't exisit. Because he's as old as the stars and watches them burn. He's not the Grim Reaper.
He just sits. Like a weird person. With his 3 arms (maybe 4 idk that guy IS pretty weird) and.
On the sad day when the universe ended and all the stars had burned out. Voldemort shed a single tear and smiled
for the first time in 1,000,556,223 years. And it was his birthday which was pretty cool. Fukn Stalin and Hitler can go live in a fukn fantasy. Voldemort..?
man.........................

And then, after this momentous day...after the universe ended.
It rained a different kind of rain.
You could smell it in the air. And it was brown. Yup. You guessed it. Roosters. Because Voldemort loved cockroaches
because they reminded him of being Fucked in the ass by Saddam Hussein. *cough* i mean, roosters.

tldr: and is very depressed.",So Voldemort is in a dark place somewhere...,0

The next day, he was at a shop nearby and he heard rumors about some gold diggers finding gold near his farm. With the chicken on his back and a shovel in his hand, he decided to try to try his luck. While walking along a path, the chicken started clucking quite loudly, so he set stuck the shovel in the ground and went to see what was wrong with the chicken. The shovel fell over and revealed a gold nugget right where he stuck the shovel!

He ran home to his wife and told her what happened, and how he believe the chicken had a sixth sense for finding gold. They were so happy that they spent all their gold on a lot of cows to expand their farm.

The next day the farmer went up the path again with the same chicken and some travelling equipment. He searched and searched for days and the chicken made no sound. He finally gave up and went home. When he reached his farm, he saw his wife crying, and cows were dead everywhere.

""What happened to the cows?"" asked the farmer.

""I don't know, they must have been sick when we got them. They all died last night. Please tell me you and your chicken found more gold."" said the farmer's wife.

Apparently, cows love marijuana as much as people, and cattle ranches and nearby marijuana farms are on the brink of open warfare. Cows keep breaking down fences and eating entire crops of marijuana, so the growers are suing the ranchers for damages. At the same time, cattle ranchers are counter-suing the marijuana growers for damaging THEIR product, since consuming even a small amount of marijuana ruins the flavor of both beef and milk. 

Tensions are running extremely high, and the political fallout could be extreme. In addition to the lawsuits, both sides are gathering signatures for ballot measures to limit the other group's ability to retaliate. It's an incredibly important issue for the entire state, threatening the entire future of either Colorado's historic beef industry or its new but rapidly-growing marijuana industry. The economic impact is unprecedented, and the political, social, and legal fallout will likely affect the entire nation.

""Do you think the shoes will still be in the shop?"" Arnold asked. 

""Not very likely,"" his wife said. 

""It's worth a try,"" Arnold said, pocketing the ticket. He went downstairs, hopped into the car, and drove to the store. 

With a straight face, he handed the ticket to the man behind the counter. 

With a face just as straight, the man said, ""Just a minute. I'll have to look for these."" 

He disappeared into a dark corner at the back of the shop. 

Two minutes later, the man called out, ""Here they are!"" 

""No kidding?"" Arnold called back. ""That's terrific! Who would have thought they'd still be here after all this time.""

I was stressed out and not thinking very fondly of the Christmas season right then. It was dark, cold, and wet in the parking lot as I was loading my car up with gifts that I felt obligated to buy. I noticed that I was missing a receipt that I might need later, so, mumbling under my breath, I retraced my steps to the mall entrance.

As I was searching the wet pavement for the lost receipt, I heard a quiet sobbing. The crying was coming from a poorly dressed boy about 12 years old. He was short and thin, and had no coat. He was just wearing a ragged flannel shirt to protect him from the cold night's chill. Oddly enough, he was holding a hundred dollar bill in his hand. Thinking that he had gotten lost from his parents, I asked him what was wrong.

He told me his sad story. He said that he came from a large family. He had three brothers and two sisters. His father had died when he was nine years old. His mother was poorly educated and worked two full time jobs. She made very little to support her large family. Nevertheless, she had managed to save two hundred dollars to buy her children Christmas presents. The young boy had been dropped off on the way to her second job. He was to use the money to buy presents for all his siblings and save just enough to take the bus home.
He had not even entered the mall, when an older boy grabbed one of the hundred dollar bills and disappeared into the night.

""Why didn't you scream for help?"" I asked. 

The boy said, ""I did."" 

""And nobody came to help you?"" I wondered. The boy stared at the sidewalk and sadly shook his head. 

""How loud did you scream?"" I inquired. The soft-spoken boy looked up and meekly whispered, ""Help me!""

I realized that absolutely no one could have heard that poor boy cry for help.
So, I grabbed his other hundred and ran to my car.",Sad Christmas Story,55

Since the audience was different each week, the magician did the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.
Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.
The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.
They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.
This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said
""Okay, I give up. Where's the fucking ship?""
