It was alright they pay was worth it but at the end he was horny as hell . 
So as soon as they docked he quickly went to the most seedy bar he could find. When he arrived he quickly asked the bartender : Where can I get the best blowjob in town.

The bartender laughed and quickly stated :Cindy luu
And handed him a card with the address where he could find her.
As he arrived at the address he was quickly greeted by this hot woman, big breast, ass to dream off and thick lips.

Barry stated with a shaking tone : I heard that you gave the best blowjob in town.
Cindy laughed and quickly stated : Hell yeah honey, I give the best blowjob there is. But honey its going to cost you 1000 dollars.
Barry stumbled and was about to leave when she grabbed him by his shirt and dragged him towards the window.
Look honey, see all those cars .
Barry looked outside and saw a long row of high end cars, seemingly brand new and the row was way up the street.
I own all these cars, just because I give a great blowjob.

Admitting to himself, he had enough money to pay for that after those six months at sea and hell, Barry thought to himself. I got to try this out.

So he handed Cindy the money and before he could say a word she ripped off his pants. And boy he had never experienced anything like that, she sucked and suckled , nipped and tugged just the right way and the way she treated his balls. He quickly found himself weak in his body when he got the best climax he ever had.

And boy this was the best 1000 dollars he had ever spent, so he went quite happy from her home and off to sea with memory´s to live by.
Six months passed and he found himself back in that bar. But now he wanted something more exotic. So he quickly asked the bartender : Erm, where could I get the best anal in town.
The bartender smiled and handed Barry a card. "" Cindy luu gives the best anal in town "" 
Honestly Barry did not need that card and he found himself quickly at Cindy´s doorstep, knocking on her door.

As she opened, she looked at him with those bedroom eyes off hers. "" What do you want honey ""
Barry smiled and stated : I heard you gave the best anal in town.
Cindy quickly replied : Ohh honey, your at the right place , but it will cost you 10000 dollars.
WHAT! Screamed Barry , but before he could utter out another word she hinted to him to follow her inside. 
Back at the window , she pulled away the curtains. 
Look honey, do you see all those houses .
Barry looked and saw the far row of fancy houses stretching far out, where all the cars where parked outside.
Those are all my houses, that is just how good I am.

Barry swallowed and pulled up 10k and handed to her. 
And like a sex crazed demon she pounced him, dragged him into bed and like a dream, she straddled him. Riding him and that body of hers moving on him like a sex goddess , he could feel her inside just tensing and as she rode faster and faster , in combine of her moaning and almost like her ass was sucking on his cock , he found himself climaxing so good that he literally passed out from pleasure. 

Happy with the service Barry went to sea again. Six months passed slowly as he could not wait to dock again.
Not bothering to enter that bar again, he took all his money and headed straight to Cindy´s place.
And with that big sexy smile off hers she opened the door, licking her lips as he was sure that she remembered him. 
Cindy, stated Barry. I want too fuck you Cindy. How much is your pussy worth?  
But to Barry´s surprise Cindy just stated no, even though he offered her 100k for her service. And as he got more and more aggressive on offering Cindy more money, to the point he offered her all he had and that was almost a million dollars. Literally everything he had earned the last 18 months. Only then Cindy walked towards the window.
With glee in his eyes Barry followed her and as Cindy opened up the curtain she quickly stated.
Hun if I had a pussy , this whole neighborhood would be mine.
",Barry got work as a sailor.,7

Everything was a contest, and the husband sank into a deep depression because he had yet to win a single one.  Finally he sought professional counsel, explaining to the shrink that while he wouldn't mind losing once in a while, his unbroken string of defeats against his wife, had left him pretty down.
 
""Simple enough.  All we have to do is devise a game that you can't possibly lose.""  The shrink thought for a moment, then he proposed a peeing contest.  ""Whoever can pee higher on the wall wins?   How could any woman win?""
 
Running home with renewed enthusiasm, the husband called upstairs, ""Darling, I've got a new game!""
 
""Oooh, I love games,"" his wife squealed, running down the stairs.  ""What is it?""
 
""Come on out here,"" the salesman instructed, pulling his his saleswoman wife out to the patio.  ""We're going to stand here and pee against the garage wall, and whoever makes the highest mark wins!""
 
""Sounds like fun!   I'll go first!""  His wife proceeded to lift up her dress, then her leg, and she managed to pee on the garage wall about six inches up from the ground.   She turned to him expectantly.
 
""Okay, now it's my turn,"" said the beleaguered husband eagerly.  He unzipped his fly, and was just about to make his mark when his wife interrupted.

The boy becomes interested and revives Gabenism.

His parents took an interest in their boy's new found passion, and they enjoyed hearing him pray the ancient prayers before every meal.

One night, the boy chose to pray the ancient prayer of threes. ""Lord Gaben, bring me luck with skins and wins and hats. Thank you for learning threes. Thank you for this game thricefold now, as the prophets foretold. Amen.""

At this his father gives a chuckle.

His son looked up, and a little bit hurt, he asked, ""What's so funny?""

The dad then says, ""Sorry son, but even I know that Half Life 3 is an ancient myth.""

The sign says ""moderated, any offense will not be tolerated"" along with a list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.

As he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.

So he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.

He starts, **""I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-""**

""I fucking LOVE bacon!"" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. 

At this the woman in the next table shouts ""You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)"".

Her husband immediately shouts ""oh I love your baking, Frankenswine"".

A guy from the opposite corner chimes-in ""This is why I bring home the bacon!"". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.

""I love you too HAMLET""

""Watch out she's a PIGpocket""

""Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK""

""Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!""

Silence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.

**“I was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don’t think that-”** Interrupted.

*Slow clap*

“Am I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?” shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.

“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a troll” 

“Dad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.”

“Break off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances”

“This sounds so fake you karma whore”

“Grow up you fucking piece of shit”

“Yo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.”

And this starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.

Now our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **“FUCK! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!”**

After about a year, the unmarried beautiful daughter ended up giving birth to a white baby. The chief was furious and demanded the head of the volunteer worker.

The villagers brought him before the chief to be executed. He pleaded for his life and said that nature has random variations built into it. He said, ""Look at that flock of sheep over there. You see how they are all white, except for that single black one? This kind of thing happens in nature all the time.""

""listen my friend, I am feeling very strong today and am ready to put up a great score on the course today. I demand the caddy with the best eyesight who can help me track my ball after I hit it 400 yards""

The manager gives the young man a grin, and yells ""Leeroy, get out here!""

Right on cue, a very old man stumbles into the room and slowly walks towards the two men, ready to go to work. 

""Leeroy at your service, sir"" he mumbles half heartily.

""This is your caddy with the best vision?"" asks the young man, ""It looks like this old geezer can barely walk the course, much less find my balls and carry my clubs""

""What?"" exclaims Leeroy, who has lost most of his hearing due to old age

The manager replies ""Well I assure you, Leeroy can follow a ball like no other, his eyes are like those of hawks, he is the man for you""

The young boy seems content with the managers words, and he can't wait to see it for himself. He quickly walks towards hole one and motions for Leeroy to follow. 

As the young man places the ball on the tee and gets ready to hit, he glances over at Leeroy and sneers ""get ready for this one"", and swings hard at the ball.

Boom, perfect contact. The ball launches off of the tee so fast that the young man had no chance of keeping his eye on it. 

The young man turns to Leeroy and asks ""did you see where that went?""

""Well of course, sir, it was a great shot indeed""

""Well I knew it would be a great shot"" the young man replies with a grin, all the while thinking of what a great decision the manager made giving Leeroy to him as a caddy. 

""Well Leeroy, Where is it?""

Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable and understanding . If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.

So he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.

He starts, **""I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-""**

""I fucking LOVE bacon!"" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. 

At this the woman in the next table shouts ""You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)"".

Her husband immediately shouts ""oh I love your baking, Frankenswine"".

A guy from the opposite corner chimes-in ""This is why I bring home the bacon!"". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.

""I love you too HAMLET""

""Watch out she's a PIGpocket""

""Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK""

""Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!""

Silence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.

**“I was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don’t think that-”** Interrupted.

*Slow clap*

“Am I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?” shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.

“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a troll” 

“Dad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.”

“Break off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances”

“This sounds so fake you karma whore”

“Grow up you fucking piece of shit”

“Yo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.”

And this starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.

Now our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **“FUCK! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!”**

The warehouse manager instantly retorts back “THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!” to which there is a roar of laughter.

And the bartender snaps ""How many times are we going to hear the same shit over and over again?""",A bar named reddit..,0

The first alien says ""Take us to your leader.""

No response.

""Just let me do the talking.""

So the first alien clears his throat and again says, ""Take us to your leader.""

Again, no response from the gas pump.

""I said, ***take us to your leader***.""

The second alien is a bit more panicked now. ""Come on, we should get out of here."" he says, ""This guy's trouble.""

The first alien then pulls his ray gun out and says ""No! I'm getting tired of this."" He then points it at the gas pump.

""All right, pal,"" he says, ""If you don't take us to your leader on the count of three, you're getting vaporized!""

""Whoa! Wait! Hold on a second!"" The second alien says, now going into full panic mode.

*""ONE...""*

""Dude, please! You don't want to do this!""

**""TWO...""**

""Stop it, man! Think of the consequences!""

#""THREE!""

**""SHIT!""**

The first alien then zaps the gas pump, resulting in an enormous explosion that blows them back by about a hundred yards. They're both bruised and covered in dirt.

""What just happened?"" asked the first alien.

The second alien was now pretty angry.

""Man..."" says the second alien, ""I told you this a million times. If **EVER** in this galaxy you happen upon a being that can wrap its dick around its waist twice and stick it in its ear, **YOU. DON'T. FUCK WITH IT!**""

Nature eventually called so he politely excused himself from the table and headed to the men's room.
He was standing at the urinal when a tall African American man named Bubba came in and stood at the urinal next to Trump.
Bubba fished a huge dick out of his pants and started taking a long satisfying piss.
Trump looked over at Bubba's huge equipment and said ""Damn, Bubba. How did you get your dick to be so big?""
Bubba said ""Well, Mr. Trump, every night before I go to bed I whack it on the bedpost three times and it grows bigger each time.""
Trump thanked Bubba for the tip and put his tiny pecker back into his own pants and headed back to his table.

Later than night, Trump was in his bedroom and his wife Melania was half asleep in the bed. Trump looked around the room to make sure nobody was looking then he pulled his dick out and whacked it on the bedpost three times.

*Whack! Whack! Whack!* 

And Melania said ""BUBBA HONEY!  IS THAT YOU??""

Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to the City Hall to renew the dog's license, I told the clerk that I would like a license for Sex. He said, ""I would like to have one too!"" Then I said, ""But she is a dog!"" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, ""You don't understand... I have had Sex since I was nine years old."" He replied, ""You must have been quite a strong boy."" When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, ""But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex."" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.
When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, ""You don't understand. ... Sex keeps me awake at night."" The clerk said, ""Me too!""
One day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. ""You don't understand,"" I said, ""I hoped to have Sex on TV."" He called me a show off.
When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married."" The Judge said, ""Me too!""
Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, ""I'm looking for Sex."" - My case comes up next Thursday.
Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, ""What seems to be the trouble?"" I replied, ""Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me for ever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely."" and the doctor said, ""Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend so get yourself a dog.""",Sex,62

post,3hu7ic,2qh72,jokes,false,1440158228,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3hu7ic/like_the_cow/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was an old woman that lived with her 3 sons in highlands. Their only source of income was a single cow which they milked, made dairy products and it was barely enough.

One morning, the woman woke up early and went to the cow barn so that she could milk the cow and collect some eggs from the chickens to make breakfast before waking up her sons. Upon entering the barn she noticed the silence and checked the cow. When she saw the cow lying dead in the barn, she felt great despair and had a heart attack, she was also dead in seconds.

When he woke up, the elder son couldnot see his mother around, suspected that something was wrong and went out to search for her. When he entered the barn he saw the cow and his mother lying on the ground dead and started crying.

At that moment; a beatiful and mischievious fairy was pulled to the elder son's crying and appeared before him. Moved by the sadness of the situation the fairy offered the elder son help;
“Don't worry. I can help. I will revive both the cow and your mother if you can fuck me 5 times without stopping, I need life energy inside me to revive them.”

The elder son, although he was in mourning, mesmerized by the beauty of the fairy and the possibility of the promise, accepted the offer and took the fairy right there on the hayloft. But as he went on with the best sex of his life, the elder son became tired and failed to complete the promise as he fell short after 4 times. Though with the tiredness of the sex and shame of not being able to save his mother and the cow, he had an hearth attack and died right there and then.

After half an hour, the middle son woke up and not seeing his mother and elder brother in the kitchen like always, he went out to check for them. Entering the barn, he found out dead bodies of his elder brother, his mother and the cow. He despaired and started crying on his knees, but then he saw the beatiful fairy. The fairy sonsoled him and made the same offer, but as the number of dead bodies were 3 this time, she said;

“I can revive all of them! I need you to fuck me 10 times back to back, so I can gather the life energy inside me to revive them”

The middle son accepted the offer and took the fairy in the hayloft, having the best sex of his life and being still young he went on and on until 9th time. But he was done. There was no energy left in him, and with the shame he had an brain aneurysm, dying on the spot.

After some time, the youngest son woke up. He noticed that he wook up late, and went to the kitchen to ask why his mother did not wake him up like she always did. Not finding his mother and his brothers there, he went directly to barn.

Upon entering the barn; the boy saw the dead bodies of his all family and was in shock. The fairy appeared before him and said;

“Hello, youngling,  don’t worry I can wake them up!” 

“How?” the boy stuttered.

“I just need life energy, if you can fuck me 15 times back to back right now in here; I can revive your mother, your brothers and the cow” 

Getting out of shock after hearing what the fairy said, the boy looked at the beatiful fairy and asked a little ashamed and blushed;

“Is it okay if I go on for 20 times instead?”

Surprised and pleased the fairy said “ Okay!”

The boy asked again;

“Uhhmm, is it okay if I go on 25 times instead?”

Fairy thought for a moment of her limits for a second and said “Yeah, I can do that!”

The boy asked again; “Maybe, uhmm, maybe I can go on for 30 times?”

Surprised and feeling a little insecure about her abilities to take that much sex; the fairy stuttered this time, and said “Ohhh, 30 times? I think I can do that.”

The boy jubilant threw the fairy on the hayloft and unbuttoned his pants;

“No dying like the cow though!”

  The King was pleased with the advice, so much that he asked the manservant to sleep with her, to the man-servant's delight. Although the queen sensed something was not right, she accepted the king's request since she desperately wanted a child. The servant did her until she got pregnant, and nine months later a baby boy was born.
   Many years passed and the child grew up. However, the people did not fail to notice the uncanny resemblance between the man-servant and the child. Tired of being accused of being an adulterous woman, she confronted the king and after when he could not bare her nagging, he told her the whole truth.

The local police force decided to allow two criminals to be punished by the public for their crimes. One was a wife beater, and the other was a rapist.

There was a queue in front of each criminal. People who queued for the rapist were allowed to give one swift kick to the rapists nuts, and people in the wife beaters queue were allowed to give one sucker punch to the wife beaters face.

A guy sees the commotion, and decided to join in the queue to punish the wife beater. The guy gets to the wife beater and swiftly launches a solid punt to the guys nuts.

A nearby police officer suddenly yells to the guy ""Hey! You can't do that, this is the punch line!"".

They were always getting into trouble and their parents knew that if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.

The boys’ mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.

So the mother sent her 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.


The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, “Where is God?”

They boy’s mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide-eyed.

So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, “Where is God?”
Again the boy made no attempt to answer.

So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy’s face and bellowed, “WHERE IS GOD!?”

The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.

When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, “What happened?”

The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, “We are in BIG trouble this time, dude…
God is missing–and they think WE did it!”",BIG Trouble! joke.,91

I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was something I had done. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, and again he said nothing. He continued to seem distant and absent.

Finally, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. He fell asleep - I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm sure his thoughts are with someone else.

One fall something horrible happened, he lost his ram. And since the closest sheep farmer was over 9 hour drive one way, he ran to his neighbor that happened to be a vet asking for help.
The vet looked at him and just said.

John, you got two options. Option one : is to drive all your sheep´s to the closest sheep farmer . Or  option two : that you could do it yourself.

Farmer John looked at the vet with big eyes. ""Myself?"".

Yes said the vet. Just take these blue pills, and if the sheep´s are laying down the morning after , the deed is done. 

Farmer John was not happy with both of the options, so he told the vet that he would think about it.

When he got home his wife asked him :  John dear, did the vet give any advice what you could do?  
And John replied that he needed to think about it. 
That he did, actually for several weeks, until that day his sheep´s where ready for mating.

Dreading the idea of having to drive the sheep´s all that way. He decided to go for the second option and got the pills from the vet.

But now John had a problem, how to get around to do that ""deed"" with the sheep´s without having his wife catching him in the ""act"". After a short thought he got a brain storm. Corralled the sheep´s into his truck and drove off with them, yelling at his wife when passing by the house that he would not be long with the sheep´s. 

After a hour drive he found a secluded spot where he could , do the ""deed"" without being spotted by his wife and god forbid any neighbor. 

So on he went, one by one he fucked each sheep for few minutes after taking the pill and when the deed was done, he got them back on the truck and hurried with them home.

But the morning after when he got up and hurried to the sheep´s , he sadly found them all standing.

WHAT THE HELL: Screamed John, cursing under his breath that he could not perform on the sheep´s enough to make them pregnant. So he hurried again and as before he got them on his truck and drove off with them. Cursing the whole time that he would so show them. 

But this time he took his time with each of the sheep. Fucking them for almost thirty minutes each, and when he was done, he was a little shaken but was pretty sure that he had done the deed now as he drove the sheep´s home.

Morning after , he almost wanted to cry when he saw each of the sheep´s standing there and looking at him. 

Furious he got them back into his truck, speeding with them back to the place and as soon as he popped the pill he started fucking them. And after a hour with each sheep he was shaking, trembling. But by all that load left in each sheep there could be no way that non of the sheep was not impregnated now by him. 

And the ride home was slow, after eight hours of that marathon of sex with his sheep´s, he was more than happy when he finally got home and straight into bed as he knew the sheep´s would be laying in the morning after this.

And he barely felt like he had slept when his wife woke him up.

John... John... JOHN!!!

What , what ? mumbled John barely grasping in his mind what was going on. But his wife was visibly shaken.

Something is wrong with the sheep´s John.. She stated with her eyes wide and doe like. 

Ahhh! said John. Are the sheep´s all laying down?

No! Screamed his wife. They are all in the truck, honking the horn.",Old farmers joke I learned when I was little.,6

After looking at this object getting closer and closer, he looked down at his speedometer, and he was driving about 45 MPH. After a minute or so, the object was almost to the rear of his car, and he could tell that it was not large at all. He glanced at his side view mirror, and saw that the object was getting ready to pass him, so he slowed down to 40 MPH. As the object began to pass, the man was shocked to see that it was a chicken, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake.

The man sped up to 50 MPH, and the chicken was keeping pace. Accelerating to 60 MPH, the chicken began to pull away, and whipped in front of the man, leaving him in a cloud of dust. The road began to twist and turn more, so he slowed down, and followed the dusty trail left behind by the speeding bird.

The man followed the chicken for another minute or so, and saw it run under a fence next to a farmhouse, where there was a huge dust cloud being kicked up. He pulled off of the road, and parked next to the fence, at about the same spot that the chicken ran underneath.

As he was trying to figure out what had just happened, he glanced down at the ground, and noticed another chicken pecking around at a fence post. Upon closer examination, he was shocked to see that the chicken had three legs, and there were many more running around inside the fence. He didn't know what to think about this situation.

Just then, an older gentleman comes up to the man and says, ""Can I help ya?""

The man says, ""Uhh, sure, I think so. I think that I was passed on the road by one of your chickens. I followed it here, and it ran underneath the fence, and now I see this one here with THREE legs! What is going on?""

The farmer says, ""Well, mister, my wife and my son and I all love ta eat chicken, and we loooove to eat drumsticks.

He was struggling with the language and didn't understand a whole lot of what was going on. Intending to visit one of the local churches, he got lost, but eventually got back on track and found the place. 

Having arrived late, the church was already packed. The only pew left was the one on the front row. 

So as not to make a fool of himself, he decided to pick someone out of the crowd to imitate. He chose to follow the man sitting next to him on the front pew. As they sang, the man clapped his hands, so the missionary recruit clapped too. 

When the man stood up to pray, the missionary recruit stood up too. When the man sat down, he sat down. When the man held the cup and bread for the Lord's Supper, he held the cup and bread. 

During the preaching, the recruit didn't understand a thing. He just sat there and tried to look just like that man in the front pew. 

Then the preacher said some words that he didn't understand and he saw the man next to him stand up. So he stood up too. Suddenly a hush fell over the entire congregation. A few people gasped. He looked around and saw that nobody else was standing. So he sat down. 

After the service ended, the preacher stood at the door shaking the hands of those who were leaving. When the missionary recruit stretched out his hand to greet the preacher, the preacher said, in English: ""I take it you don't speak Spanish."" 

The missionary recruit replied: ""No I don't. It's that obvious?"" 

""Well yes,"" said the preacher, ""I announced that the Acosta family had a newborn baby boy and would the proud father please stand up.""",A new missionary goes to Venezuela,3

In light of the rising frequency of human/grizzly bear
conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game
is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra
precautions and keep alert for bears while in the field.
We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on
their clothing so as not to startle the bears that aren't
expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen to carry
pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a
bear.

It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear
activity.  Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference
between black bear and grizzly bear poop.  Black bear poop is smaller and contains a lot of berry seeds and squirrel fur.

Grizzly bear poop has little bells in it and smells like pepper spray.",Bear Warning!,17

Wanting to have a different experience than most tourists, he decides to go off the beaten trail and explore the culture. During his exploring he manages to find an odd looking building. *This looks interesting,* he thinks, so he enters. There he is suddenly approached by an old man, who asks what he's doing here?

""Oh?"" says the man. ""I just want to know what this poky little place is for.""

""Actually,"" says the old man, ""you've come at a good time. This is a commune holding a small religious community and we're looking to grow our numbers.""

""I'm afraid I'm not interested.""

""Well, perhaps you can stay until night and see what it's like,"" the old man suggests.""

Now the tourists is suspicious that this old man might have criminal purposes, and considers leaving. But as soon as the thought enters his mind, he remembers his commitment to truly experience Southeast Asian culture, off the beaten path, more immersed than other tourists. *I'm not afraid of a little risk,* the tourist thinks to himself. 

""I think I will stay for a while,"" the tourist says, to the old man's happiness. The old man, after saying some words of thanks, leads the tourist to a table.

""Let me tell you about our little commune,"" says the old man. ""You see, we that originally had our roots in America. We're taking it upon ourselves to bring Jesus' millennial kingdom ourselves. Other Christians are all deluded. You see, Jesus really returned during..."" 

And the old man continues on like this, and the tourist begins to grow bored. Sensing this, the old man suddenly changes topic. 

""Young man,"" he says, ""let me tell you something special about our religious commune. We don't believe in marriage. We're freer than that. We let men and women sleep with whomever they please.""

""Some sort of prostitution thing?""

""Oh heavens no, we don't believe in money. Everything is a free choice.""

""Oh really?"" asks the tourist, who is starting to think that his risk-taking will pay dividends. ""Can I see some of the others, then?""

""Of course!"" says the old man, and he calls out some names. In a short while three beautiful women appear at the end of the room. 

""Oh my,"" says the tourist.

""Indeed,"" says the old man, ""we don't believe in marriage. Ladies, please escort this young man to the guest room.""

And the women, giggling, surround the tourist and take him upstairs toward a large room with a bed in the middle. Hardly believing his luck, the tourist quickly strips down. But then the women start to laugh.

""Oh, wait, you don't understand!"" cries the tourist. ""It's just cold in here!"" But the women are laughing harder now.

""Whatever!"" cries the tourist, ""you probably all have nasty STDs anyway!"" He quickly pulls his pants back up over his incredibly embarrassing erection. Tears appear in his eyes. The women are in hysterics. Humiliated, the tourist runs out of the room, downstairs, past the old man, and out the door, harshly regretting his decision to go off the beaten path.

""Well,"" chuckles the old man to himself. ""Looks like Oneida Bangkok makes a hard man humble.""

A Christian man and his wife were driving through a known Muslim country that had ISIS activity throughout it. They weren't happy, but they had to get through the country to get somewhere. So they're driving along and suddenly they're stopped by a group of people they can immediately identify as members of ISIS- they have outwardly Muslim appearance and are carrying large guns. After shouting at the man in Arabic, one of them addresses him in English:

""You! Are you Muslim? Are you with Allah?""

The husband panics and agrees- ""Yes! I am a good Muslim man! Please, let me pass!""

The ISIS members wave them on, and they continue driving. The wife freaks out, and says,

""Are you kidding! We don't know anything about Islam or the Qur'an! What if they'd asked us about it, we would have been caught out immediately!""

The husband laughs and says, ""Dear, if they'd read the Qur'an, they wouldn't be in ISIS!""","I remembered my favourite joke about Islam last night and I had a giggle, so I'm gonna share it:",7

Eventually the construction crew, all of them ""gems-in-the-rough,"" more or less adopted her as a kind of project mascot.  They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, &amp; gave her 20 little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her 10 dollars ""pay"" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed &amp; asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied, ""I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us. I learned a lot from them.""

(A) The actor assumes, without providing justification, that actors' well-being is more important than saving money.

(B) The actor attacks the director instead of her argument.

(C) Given her occupation, the actor is clearly biased and her argument should be ignored.

(D) The consequences of the director's suggestion, outlined by the actor, are exaggerated. 








The answer is (A), by the way.","I got bored studying for the LSAT, so I wrote a humorously dark test question.",1

The only reason I’m not here now darling is that I’m at work to make enough money to buy you a house, a picket fence, we’ll have dogs and children. When the 5 o’clock dinner bell rings I will be home like the winged Gossamer of love in your arms.

One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God. He thought he should open it to see what it was about. The letter read:


Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension check. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?

Sincerely,


Edna



The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.


Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter came from the old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. It read:


Dear God,
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it must have been those thieving bastards at the Post Office.

There was a sign on the cage that said Rs.250.

""Why so little?"" she asked the pet store owner.

The owner looked at her and said, ""Look, I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a house of prostitution, and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff.""

The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She tookit home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something.

The bird looked around the room, then at her, and said,""New house, new madam.""

The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought ""that's really not so bad.""

When her two teenage daughters returned from school, the bird saw them and said,""New house, new madam, new girls.""

The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation considering how and where the parrot had been raised.

Moments later, the woman's husband Mohit came home from work.

The bird looked at him and said, ""Hi Mohit.""

None of the apartments in this complex have air-conditioning. It's close to midnight, December in Sydney AUS, it's a hot humid night. 

**Story:** With the heat and humidity I was finding it very hard to sleep, and had taken to watching some Japanese horror flicks on my laptop to kill some time. I had my headphones on since I needed to open all the bedroom windows (thanks to the heat) and I didn't want to disturb my neighbours.
At a poignant part of the story in the movie, I could hear over the sound track a slow rhythmic masculine groan. After about a minute of confusion I realised that some of my neighbours were enjoying some casual coital union. The rhythmic groan picked up in frequency and amplitude, and was soon offset with his partners feminine ""yes""es.
Needless to say, I was no longer watching my horror movie and I was laughing hysterically, yet quietly, at this point into my pillow.

Quickly their coital activities got to a point of ""fever pitch"" where the male neighbour announced, ""I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!"" to which the female neighbour demands he ""wait, and cum on my face!"". Cue a series of climatic groaning and other such sounds of affirmation.

Job done, the female announces that she's heading off to have a shower (good call) and goes to the bathroom to do so. All the windows are open it seems, as one can hear all the associated sounds of a shower hard earned. 

Upon her arrival back into the bedroom the female scolds her counterpart for lighting up and enjoying a cigarette in her absence,  stating ""Dammit you know that ciggie smoke irritates my sinuses!"". Shortly after this statement, she sneezes loudly and impressively. At this point I turn towards my open window and say in a nice loud voice ""Bless you!""...

..Silence...

...An embarrassed scream.

...And a Guinness World Record attempt in the number of windows closed in the shortest period of time possible. 

I nearly pissed myself laughing.","[nsfw] Totally legit, but you can use a joke if you want to.",4382

Now, as the store wraps up their purchases, they unfortunately mixed up the gloves and the undies, unbeknownst to the poor guy. Well, he decides to mail the gloves to his girl and adds the following note:

""I got you these because I noticed you don't normally wear any. I think I'd have preferred ones with buttons, but your sister wears short ones too, and they're easier to pull off. The color might be a bit risky, but the shop assistant showed me hers, which she'd been wearing for three weeks, and they were hardly stained. She also tried yours on, and it look really chic. 

I wish I could be the first one to put them on you, but by the time I see you next Friday, I'm sure many will have come into contact with them. When you take them off, don't forget to blow into them, because they get wet from wearing. Think about how often I'll kiss them for the next years. I hope you'll wear them for me this Friday.

Love,
your darling.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.
Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.

Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not  accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ""Oh my God.""",Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?,1
