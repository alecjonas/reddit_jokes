For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.


The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",My favourite joke,219

The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it.
He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.
Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off–it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights.
He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons’ vehicles left.
At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.
The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyzer test.
To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!
Dumbfounded, the officer said, I’ll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.’

So when he got onto the horse, he said ""Jesus."" Upon hearing it, the horse started to head across the field towards his homeland.

Along the way, the monk thought, ""This horse is really slow, maybe saying it a few more times would speed it up."" So he said ""Jesus"" a few more times, and the horse got faster and faster.

He continued to say ""Jesus."" as he travel to increase the speed, when then he saw in the distance that he was approaching towards a pit hole.

Realising that at the pace of his horse galloping, he would eventually fall into his doom, so he told it to stop. As expected, the horse continue to gallop towards the looping hole, and he keep trying to make the horse slow down, but to no avail. Knowing that he is going to die, he shouted one last time:

""JESUS PLEASE SAVE ME!!!!""

There, the horse suddenly came to a halt, just along the cliff side of the pithole. Thankful for his near death experience, he let out a sigh of relief, and said:

""Thank you, Jesus.""

The first soldier is put against the wall. The firing squad stands before him, and the commander yells ""Ready, aim!""


Then the first soldier gets an idea. He yells ""TORNADO!"" Panic ensues. The firing squad runs for shelter, the sirens go off, and in the chaos he slips over the wall and to safety. 


Eventually, the enemies realize there is no tornado and go to resume the execution. They take the second prisoner and line him up against the wall. The commander yells ""Ready, aim!"" 


The second prisoner yells ""Bombing run!"" The sirens go off, everyone runs for shelter, and in the panic he slips over the wall and runs off to safety, rejoining his friend. 


Finally, the commotion dies down. The commander is livid at this point. He lines the third prisoner up against the wall and commands the firing squad. ""Ready, aim!""

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.
The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.
If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?
The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.
He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.
The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.
The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.
He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.
The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.
Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.
The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end .
He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.
But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.﻿

When she arrives, she is appalled to find that all the men are happily engrossed with other women. Despite this, she does not give up and stays at the bar, disgruntled but determined.

 After quite a few drinks, many of the patrons had left, and she notices a young man sitting alone at one of the corner tables. 

She sits across from him and they start chatting away. 

Considerably drunk, she says to him, ""You know, I just cant seem to find happiness anymore, but I'm OK with that. Happiness or no happiness, I just want sex with you.""

One thing leads to another and she ends up in his apartment, ready to have sex. 

She quickly goes to the bathroom for a quick once-over, and strangely notices panties in the hamper, but thinks nothing more of it, relieved to finally do something with someone. 

The lights dim, the music plays, and she unzips the man's pants, only to find a pair of pink panties, his penis seemingly nonexistent.

What in the *Fuck* is this?? She says

The man replies, ""Well, I thought you were OK with me not having a penis? you did say, '*a-penis* or no *a-penis*, I just want sex with you!' I guess its like you said. *A-penis* is hard to find"".

But of course it's surely a repost.  I like to put on the Texan drawl and Irish accent for this one...

After a long day of sightseeing the Irish countryside the Texan wants to relax and have a beer so he heads into the first pub he sees.  Folk gawk at his cowboy getup, but soon enough he's knocking beers back and making friends.

After a few pints he's feeling pretty tipsy, and decides to offer up a wager.  ""Listen here fellas"", he says through the boisterous chatter, ""I reckon you Irish folks are real champs at drinkin"" to scattered cheers and laughter.  ""But every man has his limits, so how bout a wager?  I'll bet one THOUsand of your funny lil pounds that nobody here can drink 10 pints of this fine Ginn-ess all in a row!""

The pub goes silent - quite a few look like they're considering the challenge - but it's clear nobody wants to stake a one thousand pounds on it.  Suddenly, at the far end of the bar a loud SCREEEECH is heard as a man shoves his barstool back and goes FLYING out the door as fast as he can.

Everyone looks bemused as the door flutters shut behind him, but soon enough everyone is back to drinking and having a good time, and nobody takes the texan up on his offer.

A short while later the man comes bolting back into the pub, short of breath.  Panting, he asks ""Excuse me, sir...  Your offer with the thousand pounds, is it still good?""  To which the Texan replies ""Well sure son, aint nobody took me up on it yet so that thousand is still on the table.""

The bartender pours out 10 pints and lines them up on the bar as the crowd gathers round.  One at a time, and in quick succession, he upends one glass after another with barely a pause between them.  Soon he's finishing the 10th beer, to cheers and hollers from the crowd.  The Texan bellows with laughter and begins to count out a thousand pounds, merrily handing it over to the lad.

As the crown returns to their general merriment the Texan turns to the Irishman and asks, ""Well son you earned it fair and square, but answer me this, what in the samhell did you go bolting outta the pub for earlier?""  To which he replies, ""Well sir, I've not got a thousand pounds to me name, so I ran to the pub down the road to make sure I could do it first.""",A rich Texan is on vacation in Ireland...,23

I called IKEA and told them about my issue.  They said there must have been a shortage, but this was a limited-run item.  I asked them what I should do.  At that time, they informed me that I was to go into my nearest store to obtain one.

I went into my IKEA store, and walked through the store to get to the customer service desk to get the missing piece to my desk.  

As I got to the desk, a large circle started forming with angry customers.  There were no workers in sight; they must have been on break.  My attention turned to the circle.  

I had asked the gentlemen next to me where some workers would be, and I explained my problem about the missing piece from the desk I had bought.  'You too?' asked another person. 'I bought the same desk.' 'Me too!' exclaimed another person.  'Mine is missing one of the first connecting rods!' echoed another voice.

It was at this time that an announcement was made over the intercom that the connecting rod was indeed found, but there was only one.  Due to the massive number of customers with this problem, many people would be disappointed.

This caused an eruption of yelling.  There were several people visibly upset by travelling all this way for nothing.  So, we figured out a way to determine who would get the missing piece: we would hold a last-man-standing battle royale.  The person to endure the longest would be the winner.

Many punches were thrown initially.  I watched men spearing each other to the ground.  Many hits connected, and I even got to chuckle as I watched some fighters completely miss and end up punching a wall.

Soon, blood was everywhere.  It even worked to fight and use the blood to slide faster into your opponents.  After 3 long hours of fighting, Leon was the last man upright, and he took home the prize.

And on that day, we were all proud.  We had all done our best to get what we wanted, even though we lost.  

But every one of us did fight for our right to part A.

The pimp is immediately taken back and tells the kid that he can't allow that. When the child thrusts forward the stack of money, the pimp thinks to himself for a moment about the offer.  He considers the fact that what he's doing isn't exactly moral anyway, so what's the big deal if he lets a kid in? After taking the cash and counting it, he says, ""With this type of money you can afford to pay for higher quality girls then Jessica in the back."" The kid refuses saying ""No, it has to be Jessica."" So the pimp tells him which doors to go through, and shakes his head as the kid walks through the door, taking his flat frog with him. 

After about 20 minutes the kid comes back out, still with the flat frog, looking quite pleased with himself. The pimp stops him before he leaves the establishment saying ""Alright kid. I got two questions for you. One, why did you want to see Jessica in the back specifically? And two, what is up with the flat frog on a leash?"" The kid looks up at the pimp and answers, ""The word around town is that Jessica in the back has STDs. Because I had sex with her, now I have STDs. When I get home and my fucked up older sister touches me and does sexual things to me, she'll get STDs. And when my dad comes home from the bar drunk and rapes my sister, he'll get STDs. And when my mom comes home from her work in the middle of the night and sleeps with my dad, she'll get STDs. And in two days when my dad is at work and the mailman comes over and has sex with my mom, he'll get STDs. And that's the son of a bitch who ran over my frog!""",A kid walks into a whore house,0

Throughout the years, he put his knowledge to work and was able to fix almost any problem thrown at him. Unfortunately, however, he learnt from his doctor that he was slowly dying from cancer. The cure was not available at the time so this programmer took his doctor's advice and was experimental frozen in the hopes that he would be thawed out and cured. His money was frozen with him.

Some time passes and the programmer suddenly feels cold. ""It works!"", he thought, ""I am being unfrozen!"" He falls to the floor and is helped up by several men and women wearing tech gear he has never seen before.

""Hello, we unthawed you hoping that you could help us solve a bug in our bank system. You are the only one with enough experience to do it"", said one of the men. ""In exchange, we will cure your cancer with electrotherapy invented around the 2400s"", he added. 

Rejoicing, the man asked several questions about their stack and development process and when he will be learning the new technology. He also asked if c++ and java were still around as they were his favorite languages. Laughing, the bank manager said that, with some exceptions, none of the major languages of your time are used anymore. He then said, ""Don't worry though, you don't need to know this.

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""
""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me Id like you to pass a little test. Its called the Triple Filter Test.""
""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.
""Thats right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes lets take a moment to filter what youre going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""
""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""
""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you dont really know if its true or not. Now lets try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""
""No, on the contrary...""
""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though youre not certain its true?""
The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""
""No, not really.""
""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""
The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.
It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife",Socrates the philosopher,727

He knocked on the door and roused the monks. ""I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?"" He asked. 

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. 

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. 

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again! Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. 

""What was that sound?"" He asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?"" 

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk."" 

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is,"" he begged. 

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk. 

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl. ""Please tell me what made that sound,"" he said. 

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said. 

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. 

He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" 

The head monk just shook his head. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" he said.

""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said. 

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?""

The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.""

The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."" 

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. 

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world."" The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.

The head monk heard his answer and nodded. ""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me."" 

And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. 

But, I can't tell you what it was. You're not a monk.﻿",A man was driving in the middle of nowhere down a secluded country road far from any cities.,12

post,6e88n5,2qh72,jokes,false,1496160143,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6e88n5/the_meaning_of_life/,self.jokes,,"A Redditor walks into a bar and asks the bartender

“Bartender, get me something new and fresh from r/jokes.” He chirped

“Sorry mate, all we have are reposts from the last 8 years”

“How can this be!” The Redditor exclaimed “If I can’t get my fix from r/jokes, then what is the point of living!”

“Yeah, what IS the point of living” the bartender grumbled

The Redditor then sat there for what felt like hours, pondering the meaning of his pitiful existence. Over the later days, he began to become erratic, asking Scientists, Men of God and even random strangers what they thought the purpose of living is.

Unsatisfied with all his answers, he climbs to the side of a bridge in hopes of throwing himself off. His feet where on the edge and he was about to jump when and old man taps his side and says to him

“Do not jump. I know the answers you seek. Look to the stars and continue onwards”

The old man the shuffled off without another word.

With renewed hope swelling in his chest, he gathers all his life savings and builds a rocket ship. Tirelessly, he worked day and night for many, many years until it was finished.

Immediately he jumped in and launched off towards the stars, aimlessly wandering space for so long that he forgot, until he landed on another planet inhabited by alien creatures.

Clambering out of the ship, he desperately asked each alien who came across his path

“Do you know? Do you know the purpose of living?”

The alien creatures could not understand what he was saying, but understood that glint of questions in his eyes like so many others that have come past. They pointed him to a nearby comet that was orbiting the planet. He climbed back into the rocket and shot off to the comet.

Upon landing, he realises that the ball of ice is completely barren, so he then decides to dig. 

So he digs and he digs and he digs, but the Redditor was now an old man and those years of searching where finally taking his toll on him.

But as he gets to the center, he finds a piece of parchment with something written on it. The Redditor could feel that these were his last breaths but he was so close to the answer that plagued him his entire life.

The parchment simply read

“OP’s Mom”

The Redditor gave a faint chuckle

“The real joke is always in the comets”

post,6e86ak,2qh72,jokes,false,1496159532,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6e86ak/blind_date/,self.jokes,,"I once went on a blind date my friend set up for me. I had spoken to the girl on the phone a couple of times, nothing too deep, just about our families etc. I go to pick her up and she answered the door and she was gorgeous. I said ""Sara?"" She said ""no I'm Tara, Sara's sister. You must be Von. Come in and I'll get Sara."" Sara rolls around corner into the living room. Literally. She. Was. In. A. Fucking. Wheelchair. No mention about this from anybody. Not my buddy or her. What the Fuck...

I didn't want to seem like an asshole so I just pretended like I date girls in wheelchairs all of the time. I did my how do you do's with her family, dad says have her home by midnight. (Not gonna be a problem.)

We go to this little restaurant I picked out, kind of a small place and not much room for her wheelchair. People kept bumping her and sighing because she was kind of in the way. We didn't talk too much, just ate and got out of there. Next was the movie theater. I had to park in the last row and it was kind of a tight parking space so I had to pick her up and carry her to her chair. She had her arms around my neck and her long hair draped over my shoulder and we had this brief little moment. I kind of wanted to kiss her right then. Moment passed. We get the theater and it was an older theater so they didn't have the little handicap spaces for her to sit so she was in the aisle. Previews started and she got bumped into by several people trying to navigate the dark room. After about the tenth time I whispered if she would like to leave. She just smiled and nodded. I get her back to my car and into the front seat, we had another lingering moment. I asked if I should just take her back home, she said ""it's a nice night maybe we could go for a walk in the park?"" (The phrasing was not lost on me).

We get to the park and I push her around the trail that goes through the park and we just talk, and talk and talk. I find all kinds of things about her, how she lost the use of her legs, what it's like going to school, learning to drive, dating, etc. We ended up at one of the little spots at the park where you can stretch and do pull ups and sit ups. We end up on the subject of sex, I ask if she can feel down there, (yes) and how would she do it. She says she likes missionary but really liked being on top. ""How would you do that?"" ""Well for instance I could grab these bars and pull myself up and down. So what do you think?"" Heh, interesting... ""Wait do you want to do it right now?"" She smiles and makes a joke about me not being too bright, ""Um, yes please.""

I have to say that I did not see this night ending up the way it did. She is very loud and and a bit of a squirter. She also has one hell of a body and amazing upper body strength. She rocked my world. It was then that I looked at my watch and notice it was almost 2am. Oh shit! I was supposed to have her home by midnight. I get her in my car and head back to her place. My plan is to roll her up to the door, ring the doorbell and run. (18 year old me was not good with coming up with smart plans.)

We get to her place I am just about to ring the doorbell when the lights come on and the door opens and there is her father. I start stammering about how when were just walking around the park and lost track of time, ""I'mverysorrysirshouldhavepaidattentiontothetime..."" He looks at me and says 'hey relax man, most guys just leave her hanging out there.""

The father asked, ""Son, what is the matter, you have all these toys, why are you not even playing with them?""

Much to his surprise, when he came back, the walls and ceiling were covered in shit, his son was covered in shit from head to toe and had a huge grin on his face. 

His father said, ""I leave you in the room with all those toys and you didn't touch a single one, but I left you in a room full of shit and now you are absolutely filthy, what is wrong with you?""

Unfortunately there weren't many amusement parks in India, his home country. When Vindi save up enough money, he bought a plane ticket to Florida, where he decided he would start his own park.

Once he arrived, he set to work right away creating his dream park. It had wild roller coasters, fast log rides, and water slides. When the park was completed, he opened it to the public, naming it ""Vindi-Park"".

To his dismay, the park remained pretty much empty, only about 100 people showed up. The following days turned out to be just the same, with very little attendants showing up. The cost of running the park with no guests was overwhelming, so he eventually was forced to shut it down.

Once Vindi-Park was shut down, he did some research and found that the section of Florida that he was in was mainly a retired community, with many more elderly people than kids. He started thinking about how to appeal to this older audience, and it hit him; he would remake his wild park to a more relaxed, vacation theme.

He tore down all of the roller coasters and replaced them with long shaded walks, and replaced the water slides with lazy rivers.
He kept getting comments on how the new vacation center would do just as bad as the first park by many people, including his own parents, who had always disapproved of his childish dream.

Finally, the new vacation center was complete, and the opening day had triple the attendance the first park had ever gotten. Everyone was surprised at how successful it was, and their perception of Vindi pulled a complete 180.

On the second day, he named the park ""Vindi-Cation""!",Vindi's Park,1

A doctor, a lawyer and an engineer are lined up for execution. All three women are accused of conspiring against the Revolutionary government.

Nodding to the smiling crowd, the executioner glares to the doctor, ""Will you lie face up toward the blade or face down towards the basket?""

After a short pause, ""Face Up!"" she replied and lay in the stocks.

The executioner locks her in place, raises his hand for silence and releases the blade.

Swoosh!

 The blade flies down but jams with a squeak 2 pouce above her neck.

The crowd silenced.

""This has never happened before!"" exclaims the executioner

""It's a miracle! The Supreme Being has spared you!"", pausing, ""You are pardoned"", releasing her from the stocks.

The crowd boos.

Next the lawyer is asked, ""Will you lie face up toward the blade or face down towards the basket?"" - ""Face Up, like the doctor!"" she replied, and lays in the stocks.

The crowd cheers and cavorts staring at the scene in anticipation.

The executioner fastens her neck in place and releases the blade

Swoosh! It comes down and jams with a squeak, again just 2 pouce above the neck. 

Disbelieving, the crowd and the executioner cannot believe what they are seeing.

She too is spared by the intervention of the Supreme Being and the words of the executioner.

At this point the raucously disappointed crowd is becoming near riotous.

Next the engineer...

""Will you lie face up toward the blade or face down towards the basket?"" demands the executioner. 

""Face Up!"" replies the engineer, somewhat unsurprisingly. Before she, perhaps more happily that would be expected, climbs onto the guillotine and places her neck between the stocks.

The executioner fixes her in place and for a third and final time raises his arms to the crowd, who respond ecstatically with cheers of encouragement. His hand moves to the lever...

""Wait!"" Cries the engineer, the executioner looks down at her, the crowd in perplexed hush.

People from all over the world come. Mayors of other cities, even some foreign leaders. They go through a huge tour of the city and the crowd is in awe of all the beautiful architectural wonders they see around them. The crowd seems convinced that these people are not actually dumb as their reputation has lead them to believe.

At the very end of the tour as they are about to cover the enitre city, they pass by a huge grain field, and in the middle of it is a boat, with a man sitting in it fishing.

The crowd asks the tour guide why there is a man sitting on a boat in the middle of an open dry field trying to fish?

The tour guide says, ""I don't know, but I wish I could swim so I could go and ask him!""",There Was Small City Known For Its Dumb People,4
