He turns around to see a very old, haggered lady in ripped clothes. The lady painfully walks up to him smelling like a garbage bin. 
She slowly looks him up and down and says, ""This may seem a bit weird but I am your fairy godmother, and I can fix whatever is wrong son, like many things in life, there is a catch...but first tell me, what's wrong?""
The man asks, ""What is the catch?"" 
The lady replies, ""Before I can fix your problems you have to perform oral sex on me, but I promise, I can fix whatever is wrong in your life...no problem is too big for your fairy godmother.""
The man thinks to himself, 'what the hell, I was just about to kill myself so why not give this a try', ""Okay, let's try this.""
The lady takes off her stinking jacket and lays it out on the ground. She then removes her pants, which are stiff with dirt, then she peels off her underwear and lays down on the jacket. Spreading her legs, there is a god awful smell, but, gagging and choking the man somehow manages to perform oral sex.
Afterwards, the lady is laying on her jacket with a big smile on her face and the man is furiously wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve, ""Well, I did my part, now you fix my problems...""
""Okay, but first, tell me how old are you son?""
""Well, I am 39.""
""...and you still believe in fairy godmothers?""

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....""

He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""

The man said, ""Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""

The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""

They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him..",Nuts,22

Cheif comes back in, walks calmly to the bar,  sits and takes a big sip of his beer. ""Holy shit Cheif"", said the bartender. ""What the heck did that guys say to you??""

As such, he tested Naseeruddin a lot when it came to matters of patience and understanding, hoping to know where he put the line between displeasing the Hierarch and making a frivolous joke.


One Ramadan evening, when the Palace was breaking the fast, the monarch and the courtiers were served dates (the fruit, not the bed-mates) as appetizers. 


The Sheikh being the scumbag as on occasion, ate the fruit and placed the seeds on Naseeruddin's plate. This kept going on for a while, till the king stopped eating. Naseeruddin, knowing that the Sheikh and his antics, did not take this to heart. The pile of seeds began growing in Naseeruddin's plate


A bit sharp that Nasseruddin did not react to his brazen attitude, the Sheikh stoked the fire by saying:
""My Dear Naseeruddin, do you know what people will think after seeing you plate? They will think that you have eaten the most dates this evening.""

Naseeruddin, a bit disgusted by his Sheikh said:
""My Highness, do you know what people will think when they see your plate? They will think that you have eaten the dates along with their seeds.""

The second friend goes up to another house, knocks and asks the owner if he'd like to buy his duck. The home owner says ""Sure how about $10?"" ""Great"", the duck owner responds and they make the exchange.

and fell into a deep sleep.

He was awoken by a bright golden light, and he found himself standing before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said, ""You have died in your sleep Ralph.  You drank yourself to death... You're in Heaven now.  Welcome my son.""

Ralph was stunned. ""WAIT! I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for.  What about my wife?  My children? Please, send me back!""

St. Peter said, ""I'm sorry.  Your time on Earth, as a man, has passed.  I can send you back, out of Heaven, but only as a dog, or a chicken.""

Devastated, Ralph thought for a while about his options. Then he remembered the chicken farm beside his home.  His eyes widened, as the thought of watching his kids from the nearby farm seemed like a good option for him.  He requested to be re-incarnated, as a chicken. 

The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking,
and pecking the ground.

A rooster strolled past. ""So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?""

""Not bad,"" replied Ralph the hen, ""but I have this strange feeling
inside. Like I'm gonna explode!""

""You're ovulating,"" explained the rooster. ""Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?""

""Never,"" said Ralph.

""Well, just relax and let it happen,"" says the rooster. 

Ralph did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!

Ralph was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.  He began to cry as he was so thankful for this amazing opportunity to be able to give life.  

As the feeling returned, he swelled with pride, and he began to lay a third egg.

He heard someone yelling his name... 'RALPH!'  'RALPH!!!'  Then he felt a hard SMACK on the back of his head.

""RALPH! WAKE UP YOU DRUNK BASTARD! YOU'RE SHITTING IN THE BED!!!""",The Re-incarnation of Ralph,92

The biker jumps off his Harley, runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch.

Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back letting go of the girl, and the biker brings her to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly.

A reporter has watched the whole event. The reporter addressing the Harley rider says, ‘Sir, this was the most gallant and brave thing I’ve seen a man do in my whole life.’

The Harley rider replies, ‘Why, it was nothing, really, the lion was behind bars. I just saw this little kid in danger and acted as I felt right.’

The reporter says, ‘Well, I’ll make sure this won’t go unnoticed. I’m a journalist, and tomorrow’s paper will have this story on the front page… So, what do you do for a living and what political affiliation do you have?’

The biker replies, ‘I’m a U.S. Marine and a Republican.’

The journalist leaves.

The following morning the biker buys the paper to see news of his actions, and reads, on the front page:

You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that poor Phil must have experienced.

""Phil was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain. We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Phil's scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place.""

Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Phil.

""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time his scrotum should recover completely.""

All the men sighed with unified relief. The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

It being a slow night, the bartender accepts the bet. The man then immediately pulls out his glass eye and hocks a loogie on it. 

""Bullshit!"" Yells the bartender. ""I'm not paying you jack for that!""

Without skipping a beat the man offers another bet. ""Double or nothing if I can touch your ceiling without jumping.""

The bartender sizes him up, and figures there's no way he could achieve that. ""Fine. Go ahead.""

The man then unscrews his prosthetic hand and pitches it towards the ceiling. 

""Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!"" Screams the bartender. ""Get the hell outta my bar!"" 

The man calmly screws his hand back on and offers one final wager. ""Okay, there's no way for me to cheat you on this one. I bet you 200 bucks that I can piss in your smallest shot glass without spilling a drop on your bar.""

The bartender thinks it over. ""Alright. You better not have a mechanical dick or nothing."" The bartender slams down the narrowest shot glass he has. 

A crowd of onlookers begins to form as the man jumps up on the bar and unzips his pants. Then, he begins pissing uncontrollably all over the bar and the patrons. Not a single drop makes it into the shot glass. 

The bartender is laughing uncontrollably as the man forks over the 200 bucks. The man sits down calmly like nothing happened, ignoring the looks of disgust and anger from the rest of the customers. The man orders a drink with a big grin on his face.

""You seem pretty happy for a guy that just lost 200 bucks!"" 

The man looks at the bartender and points to the back of the bar. ""You see that guy in the booth sobbing? I bet him 5000 bucks that I could pee all over your customers and make you laugh about it.""

The Madam, taking pity on him, responds: 'yeah, tell you what. Go up the stairs there and go in the door on the right. Take your clothes off and sit on the bed. You'll know what the do what the time comes.'
The man goes upstairs, goes in, takes off his clothes, sits on the bed as instructed, and waits. After a few minutes a small door in the wall opens up and a chicken comes sauntering in. Realizing that beggars can't be choosers, he manages to get a hold of the chicken and has his way with it. After he's done he sets the chicken down and it immediately makes it way for the small door. Just as it goes in it looks at him with extreme disgust. The man feels a lot of shame and quickly dresses and leaves.
The next day, he's feeling cheated and makes his way to the brothel to complain. He goes up to the Madam and says, 'hey, I know you did me a favor yesterday, but I didn't come here to be made to feel like a loser. I don't deserve the shame foisted upon me.' The Madam responds, 'OK, I hear ya. Lemme make it up to you. Go up the stairs again and this time take the door on the left.'
He does, and upon opening the door he sees several rows of theater-type seats facing a full-wall sized screen.

Despite this effort, the fuel leak worsens, and the pilot realizes the plane cannot reach land with its current weight. 

He tells his passengers that one of them must bail out to save the others. 

The Frenchman volunteers, and declares as he jumps: 
""The French are the most compassionate in the world, for France!""  

Unfortunately his sacrifice proves worthless, as the situation worsens. The pilot determines that two of the remaining men must jump to save his fellow man. 

The British man steps forward, mumbling something under his breath about, ""being beaten by a Frenchman.""

""On behalf of all English, I make this sacrifice."" He says, ""For the Queen!"" He shouts, and leaps from the plane, visibly shaking the hull. 

Now only the Mexican and American remain. They stare at one another until the American speaks. 

""I think I know what to do."" He steps towards the now-open plane door and gazes at the water far below him. 

At the last second, the American whips around and grasps the Mexican by his wrist, twisting the poor man to the edge of the door, and hurls him out. 

Over the almost inaudible Spanish coming from the descending Mexican , the American yells;

""**Remember the Alamo!**""","A British man, a Frenchman, a Mexican, and an American are flying in a small plane oven an ocean.",5

He tells the three men that heaven is a bit crowded at the moment and he can only let one of them go through right now. 

To be fair he tells the guys that “whoever has died the most unusual death can go ahead but the other two will have to wait. And tell them that the first to die can go first.

The first guy walks up and tells St. Peter: I worked the same job and lived in the same 4oth floor apartment for the past 10 years, I would take lunch at 12pm every day and go home to eat with my wife, today I decided to surprise my wife and come home early for lunch, I walk in the door and she is standing there butt naked with a look of shock on her face. I knew in my heart that she was cheating on me, so I began going through the apartment, looking everywhere for this S.O.B she was sleeping with, as I was looking in the living room I heard someone screaming out on the patio, I open the door and there is a man hanging off the ledge, I was in such a rage I kicked his hands and watched him fall 39 floors to his death. I swear he was still moving so I dragged the refrigerator from the kitchen outside and pushed it over the patio’s railing. It was such a strain on me I had a heart attack and died, and I still don’t know if I killed him.

“okay” said St. Peter “go stand over there, and let the next person who died come up”

The second guy walks up and tells St. Peter:
Well I just moved into my new 41st floor apartment and had today off so I thought I would do some unpacking, I was setting up my patio and not watching what I was doing and back into the railing and fell over, I was lucky enough to grab hold of the rails on the patio below and was screaming for help, when the guy came out, took one look at me and kicked my hands. I fell 39 floors and landed in trees and finally in some bushes. I knew I broke every bone in my body, but was very thankful for not dying. When out of nowhere this freaking refrigerator hits me. And I woke up here.

Now St. Peter looks at the first guy and then at the second and tell him to stand far away from each other and not to talk. By now the third guy walks up and St. Peter tells him “ I don’t think you have a chance of beating either one of the first two.” And with that the third guy puts his arm around St. Peter and said “picture this….I’m Naked in a refrigerator”",Three men walk up to the pearly gates of heaven (long read),5

In disbelief, Michael went to the brothel, and spoke with the owner before John could even react:

 -""I will give you the singing girl for you and your mate for free, but under one condition. Enter this here room, and  keep the light off at all times!"". Michael quickly agreed, and curiously opened the door to the room, turned off the light, and ever so patiently waited for the girl to come. The door squeaked, and Michael knew it was time. The girl went straight to the job, and he listened in disbelief as she was singing and sucking at the same time! Her voice blasted through the door, and John had heard it. He couldn't wait for his turn.

Michael was finished, exited the room, and signalled for his friend to go in, as the girl was waiting for another round. John couldn't wait. He got seated, and lo and behold, she started singing and sucking again! John's curiosity got the best of him, as he was sitting in awe and disbelief.

The teacher looked at him and said, ""You don't know where the purple mountains are?! I'll have to send you to the principal.""

Later, the prinicipal asked Jimmy why he was there. Jimmy, a little saddened, (he hadn't been to the principal at all until now) said that the teacher asked him where the purple mountains were, and he said IDK.

The stern principal looked at Jimmy, and said, ""You don't know where the purple mountains are?! I'll have to send you to the mayor!""

So, Jimmy sat in the mayor's office. The mayor asked him why he was there. 

And do you know what Jimmy said?

""The teacher asked me where (*sniffle*) the purple mountains were, and I didn't know!""

The stern mayor told him, ""You don't know where the purple mountains are? I'll have to send you to the President of the United States!""

Jimmy rode in a limo for ten hours before reaching DC. When he got there, the Pres. asked him why he was there.

You can guess what Jimmy said.

The Pres. looked at Jimmy, and he said...

""YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PURPLE MOUNTAINS ARE? I'll just send you OUT OF THE USA!!!""

Jimmy rode in a helicopter to somewhere near Cuba. He was pushed off, fell 15 feet, and landed in a lake.

A couple of minutes later, he wandered around, looking for life. Later, he found a road. *There HAS to be life here,* Jimmy thought. He started to cross the road without looking, when all of a sudden, a giant Army tank ran him over.

And the moral of this story?

Look both ways before crossing the road.

The driver felt so awful, he began to cry. A woman driving down the highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong. “I feel terrible,” he explained. “I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it.”

The woman told the man not to worry. She knew what to do. She went to her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit. Miraculously, the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. 50 feet away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved at the two again, hopped down the road another 50 feet, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 feet.

The man was astonished. He couldn’t figure out what substance could be in the woman’s spray can! He ran over to the woman and demanded, “What was in your spray can? What did you spray onto that rabbit?” The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: “‘Hair Spray’ Restores Life to Dead Hair.

They approached one of the gas pumps, and one of them said to it, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.' The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The alien repeated the greeting. There was no response. 

The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The other alien shouted to his comrade 'No, you mustn't anger him...!', but before he finished his warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap. 

When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other one and said, 'What a ferocious creature. It nearly killed us! But, how did you know it was so dangerous?' 

The other alien answered, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy, it's that if a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick into his own ear, don't screw with him!",Two aliens attack on earth,26

post,3zwreo,2qh72,jokes,false,1452191353,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3zwreo/traveling_grandpa/,self.jokes,,"A grandson once asks his grandpa:  
- Grandpa, you always traveled so much. What place would you recommend me to travel to?  
- Russia.  
- What? Why Russia?  
- Listen, it's awesome there. You walk into a store, you take whatever you want, and you don't have to pay. You walk down the street and someone annoys you by his looks? You are free to approach him, smack him in the face and no one even tries to hurt you back. You can go to a bar and get wasted as fuck without paying. Even if you see a nice lady on the street, you just take her with you, then you fuck her and everyone's cool about it.  
So the grandson buys a ticket to Moscow and he flies there.  
He walks into a store, gets some groceries and booze, and then leaves. Soon the security gets him and beats the shit out of him.  
  
So he's walking down the street, feeling frustrated and angry, when he notices a young lad smoking a cigarette. He comes up to him and hits him in the back of his head to relieve some stress. The young lad then calls his friends and the grandson gets beaten once again.  
  
Hopeless and all bruised, he wanders to a nearest bar. He drinks many shots, and after he gets totally wasted the waiter gives him a receipt. Shocked, he refuses to pay and he gets beaten and thrown out of the bar.  
  
Hungry and miserable he thinks - ""Maybe at least I'll get laid here in Russia"". The grandson grabs a random girl in a park, drags her behind a tree and does his thing. Sadly, two cops were passing by, they noticed what's happening, they beat him up and arrested him.  
  
Beaten and angry he eventually makes it back home. Right after passing the doorstep he yells at his grandpa:  
- You lied to me! You said it's so nice in Russia, yet I got beaten by security, after that I got beaten by some russian lads when I hit one of them, they threw me out of the bar and when I shagged a girl, I ended up in arrest.  
  
The grandpa then asks:  
- Who were you with?  
- Well, I bought an all inclusive travel from some cheap travel agency.   
- Oh, that's why. You know, back in the days only one travel agency covered all of those attractions.  
- Which one?  
The grandpa looked at him, and with a tear falling down his cheek, he whispered:  
- Wehrmacht...

The plane taxis normally to the runway and begins its takeoff.

The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and 
managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many 
casualties.  That night, the survivors had a great celebration.  The 
first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt.

show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

I believe there are a number of good reasons to at least be open to the idea that ghosts might well inhabit our reality.

post,3zu6dc,2qh72,jokes,false,1452146508,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3zu6dc/three_little_words/,self.jokes,,"I had reached the summit of my midlife crisis. I felt stuck in a deep rut, going nowhere, looking forward to nothing. I knew that if I didn't try to change my life, I was doomed to decades of repeating my same old mistakes. But I didn't how to make those changes -- until I read a wonderful book of inspirational stories. A woman from St. Louis, Missouri, wrote that she had changed her life simply by telling people that she loved them. People responded to those three little words in wonderful ways, and since that time her life had been greatly fulfilled. So I decided to try it myself. I vowed that for one day I would tell each person I met that I loved them.

I began the next morning while sitting at the small kitchen table with my wife of eighteen years. It had been a long time since I'd expressed any real feelings toward her. The truth is we had been going through some rough times; we'd even discussed separating. So I took a deep breath, cleared my throat, and said it: ""I love you.""

A change immediately came over her. She put down her coffee and looked at me quizzically. Then she responded with three little words of her own: ""Are you nuts?""

But by the time I got to my office I was excited. I had made real contact with my life. I had changed the dynamics of my relationship with my wife. In midmorning I called my young secretary into my office. She'd been with me for almost a year, and she was a terrible secretary. She forgot phone calls, she didn't finish her work, she was often late to the office and left early. I had been tough with her and I knew she didn't like me much. So as she stood in front of my desk, once again I got up my courage and said those three little words: ""I love you.""

She was absolutely stunned. Her arms dropped to her side and she shook her head. And then she responded with three little words of her own: ""That's sexual harassment.""

Later that afternoon I was called into the office of the company's director of human resources. He was a stern, distant man. He was known for being extremely officious and almost obsessively neat. As he started explaining to me why under current corporate guidelines I had committed a legal offense and was therefore being terminated, I interrupted him and said flatly, ""I love you.""

He looked at me as if he had never seen me before and gulped. Clearly he did not know what, to say. Finally, he looked around the room and whispered three little words of his own: ""Meet me later.""

My desk was cleaned out and I was escorted off the premises by four o'clock that afternoon.

I knew I had to persist. I saw a woman standing by herself, leaning against a building. She looked so alone, so forlorn, that I felt I had to approach her. I had to make contact with her, just one human being to another. So I walked right up to her and said clearly those three little words: ""I love you.""

And she responded with three little words of her own: ""You're under arrest."" She pulled out a badge and identified herself as a member of the vice squad.

While this was not turning out precisely as it had in that inspirational book, it certainly was changing my life. As I was brought into the courthouse to be arraigned, a man sat next to me. ""I love you,"" I said.

He laughed, then replied with three little words: ""I'm your lawyer.""

Finally I was standing before the judge. After listening to my attorney explain the situation, the judge asked me if I had anything to say. Now, how could I possibly resist? ""I love you,"" I said.

He smiled kindly. ""Go to jail.""

After being released on bail, I took a taxicab home. ""I love you,"" I told the driver.

""Twenty-eight bucks,"" he said, reading the meter.

The house was dark. But as I turned on the lights, I saw a note on the table. It was from my wife. As I read her note, I knew I had reached her in a way I'd never before thought possible. For on that piece of paper she had written in big, bold letters the three little words I had been longing to hear for so long: ""I'm leaving you!""

I had successfully changed my life.
