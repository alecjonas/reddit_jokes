The first two men open a bottle of vodka, while the third is tired and goes straight to bed. He is unable to sleep however, as his increasingly drunk friends tell political jokes loudly.

After a while, the tired man gets frustrated and walks downstairs for a smoke. He stops in the lounge and asks the receptionist to bring tea to their room in five minutes.

The man walks back into the room, joins the table, leans towards a power outlet and speaks into it:

""Comrade major, we want some tea to room 62 please.""

His friends laugh on the joke, until there is a knock on the door. The receptionist brings a tea pot. His friends fall silent and pale, horrified of what they just witnessed. The party is dead, and the man goes to sleep.

After a good night's rest, the man wakes up, and notices his friends are gone. Surprised, he walks downstairs and asks the receptionist where they went.

The nervous receptionist whispers that KGB came and took them before dawn.

The man is horrified. He wonders why he was spared.

The receptionist responds:

""Well, comrade major did quite like your tea gag.""",Three men are in a hotel room in Soviet Russia.,2043

In a fashion typical of the comedian, who always passed easily between the corporeal and the sublime, it started as a fart joke. “These planes get flying so fast that all the most vicious, lethal, volatile, flammable, unstable farts get pushed toward the back of the airplane, where they begin to build up pressure,” he said. “And they build, and they build, and they build until they reach critical fart density—C.F.D.—and they continue to build throughout the flight, until finally some kid turns on a Game Boy and *boom!* The whole back end of the plane blows off. And you know who gets blamed? Osama bin Laden. Terrorists get blamed for these explosions that are nothing more than cabbage-fart detonations.”

Three couples are trying to get married at the same church. There is a young couple, a middle-aged couple, and an elderly couple. The three couples meet with the priest and discuss when they can get married.

“If you wish to get married in my church, you must all go one month without having sex,” says the priest.

One month later the three couples return to the church ad talk to the priest. He then asks the elderly couple, “Have you completed the month with sex?”

“Yes we have, it was easy,” replies the elderly couple.

“How about you?” He asks the middle-aged couple.

“It was hard, but we didn’t have sex for the whole month,” they respond.

“And how about you two?” He asks the young couple.

“No we couldn’t do it,” responds the boyfriend.

“Tell me why,” says the priest.

“Well my girlfriend had a can of corn in her hand and she accidentally dropped it. She bent over to pick it up and that’s when it happened.”

post,avl9e0,2qh72,jokes,false,1551317743,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/avl9e0/the_poor_snake_named_nate/,self.jokes,," So... Nate the Snake was the king of the jungle, by virtue of his   
immense size. Nate was the size of a freight train, and had a similar outlook on life. He ruled largely through terror and intimidation.  


One day Nate the Snake was rumbling through the jungle, as was his own. Whenever Nate slithered, the earth shook, trees fell, and birds plummeted from the sky. Nate was out surveying his domain, and took a spin though the local village.  


Now, normally when Nate visited the village, everyone hid from him, in stark, abject, raving terror. A sort of ""hide the women and children, bury the silver in the backyard"" sort of terror. And today was no different: as Nate the Snake rolled through town, no one was on the streets, and the village seemed abandoned.  


Except for one man.  


At the far end of town, a man was standing next to a tree. Nate the Snake was bemused by this, as -- as has been mentioned -- people normally hid from him -- or at least ran screaming. But this man stood his ground. This piqued Nate's curiosity, so he rumbled and slithered up to the man. and Asked him ""Why aren't you hiding? Aren't you afraid of me?""  
""Of course I'm afraid of you, but my job is more important.""  
""Oh?"" said Nate ""And what's your job?""  
""I'm the lever man. I guard the lever tree.""  
""The lever tree?""  
""You see this lever here, in the side of the tree? If anyone flips this lever, it will destroy the entire world. My job is to keep an eye on the lever, and make sure no one touches it.""  
""Doesn't that get awfully boring?""  
""Yes, yes it does... it's been years since I've seen my family.""  


Never let it be said that Nate the Snake did not have a soft side. He took pity on the man and offered to keep an eye on the lever for him, so he could take a few days off and visit his family. The man gratefully ran screaming away in terror. And life returned to normal.  


Eventually Nate the Snake, who was a somewhat ADD snake, got bored and decided to cruise around the jungle some more. He figured that the word was pretty well out that the lever tree was being guarded by Nate the Snake, and he decided that it was quite unlikely that anyone would mess with the lever in his absence.  


A little while later, Nate heard a rumbling. Thinking it might be his tail end, he stopped. Once his entire body had stopped, he still heard the rumbling. And then he panicked: what if the rumbling had something to do with the lever tree?  


So, Nate the Snake rumbled and slithered his way back to the village as fast as he could. As he came over the rise, he saw what was making the rumbling noise: a gigantic steamroller. The local highway department was improving the road, bunging an 8 lane mega-highway through the middle of the village.  


The huge steamroller was headed right for the lever tree. Nate bellowed for the driver to stop, but the driver couldn't hear him over the rumble of the steamroller. Nate rushed towards the man, trying to get his attention, but the man was focused on the steamroller. Finally, in a fit of desperation, Nate the Snake through himself in front of the steamroller.  


This got the driver's attention: he felt a bump big enough to notice. He stopped the steamroller to get down and take a look at what he had hit. When he got down, he saw that he had run over Nate the Snake and squashed him flat. As he started to panic, he looked around and saw that his steamroller was bare inches from the lever tree.  


The steamroller driver breathed a sigh of relief and exclaimed, ""Better Nate than lever.""

So Jim asks, ""Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?""

Carl says ""Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion enough rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers.""

Jim, disgusted, says ""You have *got* to be kidding me!""

Is this perhaps a new culinary experience for sir?""  

Now I've eaten both *polpo* and *calamari* in posher joints than this, so I wasn't about to let this guy lord it over me, and I said ""Not at all. Is there a special of the day?"" and he said ""Not really, but we do have some very good squid in at the moment,"" so I said, ""All right, squid it is then."" And then we got down to the details.  

""Farmed squid or wild?"" -- well, there was only one choice here, so I asked for wild, obviously.  
""Green squid or purple?"" -- I asked the waiter for his recommendation, and he suggested green, so that was fine by me.  
""Smooth lipped or hairy?"" -- well, that threw me, but he assured me that you don't actually eat the hairy bit, and if it was him then that's what he'd have been eating. Okay, hairy it was.   

So he took my order and said, ""Very well, sir, we'll just get you the squid of your choice out of the tank and Jervaise will cook it up for you."" In the meantime there were a few pretzels to munch on and I was fine with that.  

Ten minutes or so later the waiter came back with a martini, which I hadn't ordered, and he said ""I'm so sorry, sir, there is a bit of a hold-up here. Jervaise, I regret to say, is one of these temperamental sorts, and he says he will cook a dead squid to perfection, but he will not kill a live squid, and someone else must do it. Temperamental, I say, sir, but confidentially, I believe he is just too faint-hearted for the task. However, all is not lost. Our *plongeur*, Hans, is a very down-to-earth type and I am sure he will do the necessary when he starts his shift, and in the meantime would you care to accept this drink with the compliments of the management?""  

Well, martini is not my usual tipple, but when someone else is paying I suppose it is worth a try, and I sat there sipping at the martini and toying idly with the bar snacks while I was waiting, and after a while I saw, without much surprise, that the waiter was coming back.  

He was full of apologies and assured me that there would be no charge for anything I had consumed, but, long story short, squid was off the menu tonight. Despite being supposedly down-to-earth and full of Teutonic bluntness, when Hans was handed the squid and the meat cleaver he proved completely unable to bear the trusting gaze of the unfortunate cephalopod, and the squid had been returned to the tank while the plate-washer went for a little sit-down and a quiet sob.  

And I summed up as I thought best: ""now, Hans that does dishes can be soft as Jervaise with wild green hairy-lipped squid.""","I went to a new restaurant that I'd seen. It was called ""Tentacles With Everything"".",0

post,avfp6q,2qh72,jokes,false,1551287071,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/avfp6q/four_friends_walk_into_a_forest/,self.jokes,,"This is my favourite and go-to joke and further elaborations and movements fitting those of the fourth person add to the joke:

Four friends walk into a forest and close to the path they walk on they see a fairy trapped beneath a fallen tree. They decide to help her out and once they have lifted the tree the fairy thanks all of them and says: ""I will grant all four of you 3 wishes but you need to make those after a time span of 3 years each.""                                           
The first one answers: ""I would like to have 1000$ in cash right now!""                                                                                    
The fairy says: ""No problem!"" and hands the first guy his thousand dollars.                                                          
The second guy continues to make his wish: ""My ford fiesta is a nice car but I would really like to drive an Audi A6""                  
""Your wish shall become truth and the Audi is already parked in your garage at home."", says the fairy.                                     
Guy Nr. 3 is now at the row to make his wish: ""My flat isn't really that big and I definitely need more space if I want to start a family, so I would like to own a nice single-family house in the suburbs with a nice little garden.""                                                       
""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys to your new house and its address are inside of your letterbox back at your flat.""
The last of the friends now asks the fairy: ""You know what would be really cool? If my head was spinning around in circles.""         
""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys head starts to spin around in circles.                                                                                          

Three years later the four friends meet up again to see the fairy and make their second wishes.                                                
Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""The thousand dollars you gave me were really nice but after only 3 weeks I had already spent them so this time I wish for a million dollars in my bank account!""                                                                        
""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The money you wish for is now in your bank account.""                                                               
The second one now makes his turn: ""The Audi you gave me handles really well and it's also pretty fast but I would really enjoy a faster car. This time I wish for a Porsche!""                              
""No problem"", says the fairy. ""Additionally to your Audi I now placed a Porsche in your garage.""                                       
The third guy proceeds: ""The house I wished for is quite beautiful but I would like to have a bit more room and luxury. I wish for a big mansion close to the sea!""                                                                                                                                                        
""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys and location of your mansion are now placed in a letter sent to your current address.""                                                  
The fourth guy, still spinning his head, now makes his wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head is now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my left arm was also spinning around in circles!""                                    
""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys left arm now begins to spin.

Three years later the four friends meet up one last time to see the fairy and make their final wishes.                                                
Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""Being a millionaire is a really nice thing but it would be quite awesome to be the richest guy in the world!""                                                                        
""No problem"", says the fairy, ""You are now the richest man in the world and all the money in the world summed up is now in your bank account.""                                                               
The second one now makes his turn: ""The Porsche you gave me is really fast and way more fun to drive than the Audi but I wish to have the ability to get all sports cars and luxury cars I wish for!""                              
""No problem"", says the fairy. ""I expanded your garage and whenever you wish for a car it's already inside next to all the other sporty cars and you will be able to drive a different sports car every day of the year.""                                       
The third guy now proceeds: ""I really enjoy living in that big mansion by the sea but the only thing that would be even better would be my very own island with an even bigger mansion on it.""                                                                                                                   
""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The boatsman on your private yacht will take you to your very own private island.""                                                                                                                                                             
The fourth guy, still spinning his head and his left arm, now makes the final wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head and my left arm are now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my right arm was also spinning around the whole time in the opposite direction as my left arm!""                                            
""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys right arm now begins to spin.

The four friends now meet each other in a bar after another three years has passed. And they start to talk about what has happened since the fairy granted them the wishes.                                                                      
The first guy starts talking about his life: ""My wealth is now big enough that there isn't a word to describe the number it has reached since I invested and multiplied it that often!""                                                                                           
""That's pretty awesome"", says the second guy, ""I now drive the newest prototype cars since experiencing a different car every day gave me the ability to give the best of feedback to the car manufacturers while I even get paid for driving  those multi-million dollar cars around.""                                                                                                                                                                           
The third guy now speaks about his very own wealth: ""I now own 50 additional islands and have built the most luxurious holiday resorts and earn a lot of money through that.""    
                                                                                                                                  
The last guy, still spinning his head and both arms around in circles now says: ""Guys, I think my wishes were bullshit.""",Four friends walk into a forest...,1

The man says, “oh I get you man, I see what you’re laying down.” He thanks the lifeguard and goes back home.

The next day, the man is back on the beach. The potato is in his swimsuit and he’s strutting his stuff. Only it’s not working. Infact, it’s doing the opposite; it’s repeling women.

The man storms up to the lifeguard and yells, “hey man, what’s the deal? Why isn’t this working?”

And the lifeguard says, “it’s supposed to go in the front.”",A man is trying to pickup a woman at the beach.,35

The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:""Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit.

He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.

But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, ""Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.""
The angel responds:""Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.""

A father was walking past his son's bedroom one day and happened to look in.

He was astonished to see that his bed was nicely made and everything was picked up off the floor. Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.'

Fearing the worst, he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter. It said:

*Dear Dad,*

*It is with great regret and sadness that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.*

*I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.*

*But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant.* 

*Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.*

*Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.*

*In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it.*

*Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.*

*Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.*

*Love, Your son Tim.*

*P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jimmy's house.*

*I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a lousy report card ...*

*That's in my desk drawer.*

*I love you.*",Note from the boy,13

But my life changed when I started chatting with this man on Reddit. I met him on r/jokes.

This man complimented one of my jokes and we had a conversation which quickly turned into talking about each of our interests. We had a lot in common and I found out he lives in the same state I'm in..

I was always curious about meeting another redditor in real life and I thought it would be a good chance to make a new friend, so I decided ""why not?"" and decided to meet with him.

We went out to a nearby burger king, and honestly, I didn't know meeting someone for lunch at a burger king could be so exciting. He introduced himself as ""Joe"" and I was blushing as he introduced himself. It was sooo embarrassing, but I decided to continue on and play it cool.

Having lunch with Joe was relaxing. There was one moment where I got scared because he poked his eye trying to take a sip from his straw. I could tell he poked his eye real badly. Thankfully, he made a joke about it and we laughed it off. I was worried about his eye but he told me not to worry about it since he could just visit a doctor the next day. It made me feel relieved. 

Turns out, Joe was so funny and such a genuinely kind and interesting person. To top it off, he was very handsome. After we had our lunch, we said our goodbyes and honestly I've never felt such a strong connection before.

I hate to say it, but I was attracted to him, VERY. And of course, I felt very guilty afterwards. So I told my BF what happened. He understood why I did it and told me not to talk to that man anymore, but from there, everything went into a downward spiral. It happened over the course of a few weeks..

We started arguing more, I kept on thinking about my lunch date with Joe, thinking about the ""what ifs"", and thinking that I needed to decide what I want with my life and what kind of person I wanted to spend it with.

Me and my BF ended our relationship. It was sad, but we tried to end it on good terms as much as possible.

After the breakup, I decided to contact the man I met on Reddit again, but he wouldn't answer me. I waited 2 weeks, still no answer. I couldn't find any of his profiles on Facebook, Instagram, or any social media. I wondered... ""did he give me a fake name?"" Was his name even Joe? I was pissed, but still eager to connect with him again.

A couple of weeks later, I had an idea: ""how about I use Reddit.. to find this man...that I MET on Reddit?""

Why didn't I think of this before?

I created multiple posts on different subreddits asking to see if this man named Joe is still lurking on Reddit, and I asked Joe to reach out to me if he saw my post.

Then one day.. I finally got it. An orange notification. It was a reply from Joe's original account when we first met! Who knew of all places, Reddit would be where I reconnected with the love of my life again.

I quickly opened up my post that was just a few days old, with the title ""Reddit you come from, Reddit you go? Reddit you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?""

""Oh my! That's very brave of you. I don't mean to be too forthcoming, but you seem kind of down in the dumps. Is everything alright?"" The woman purrs. The man finishes his drink in a single quaff, takes a long, slow breath and relates to the woman that his longtime girlfriend left him on his first deployment, so he re-upped and went back in for a second tour. The second tour was grueling and gruesome and the man had lost several close friends in combat. He then explains that this was once his favorite bar but now it only brings back bad memories.

""Goodness!"" The woman cried. ""You must be awfully lonely these days!"" The man nods and quietly says ""Yes ma'am. All I seem to know is how to be a soldier.""

The woman, smitten by the handsome soldier, continues to sit beside him and they keep shooting the breeze. Between the booze, good conversation, and the obvious attraction, the pair realize the sexual tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. ""Forgive me for being brash, but when was the last time you had sex?"" The woman coos. The soldier thinks for a moment. ""I'd say probably 2015."" The woman is shocked and immediately whispers in his ear that she is going to change that. They catch a ride from the bar to her house, sucking face the whole way there. 

The two burst inside her home and immediately get hot and heavy. They make love everywhere and in all kinds of positions. After some of the most vigorous and fulfilling sex of their lives, the woman gasps, ""That was incredible! I can't believe you haven't had sex since 2015!""

He grew up on a farm and was obsessed with the giant machines. He ate, slept and drank tractors, his room was covered with posters of them, bed sheets, t-shirts, the whole works. 

He met a girl, fell in love and eventually got married. She didn't share his love of tractors quite as much and began to get upset as Alan would spend more time at tractor conventions than with her. Weekends away, and even when he was home all he talked about were tractors. 

One day She said ""Right! I've had enough Alan, I love you to bits, you're my whole world. But I can't go on with you spending more time with friggin tractors than with your wife"". She gave him a choice, ""It's me or the tractors Alan, what will it be?"". Alan wasn't stupid, he replied ""Of course it is you my love, I'll give up tractors, I love you.""

That was the end of tractors for Alan, everything to do with them was GONE. He didn't know what to do with all his free time, so he and his Wife went for long walks through the country side, occasionally seeing a tractor or two. However he wouldn't say a word, he genuinely was not interested in them anymore.

One day Alan and his wife were walking through the fields when they noticed a barn on fire, with people inside. With no time to wait for the fire brigade Alan ran down to help the people inside the barn. ""You know what to do Alan!"", screamed his wife. Alan knew exactly what to do, he ran into the barn and took in a deep breath. Inhaling all the smoke Alan ran outside and blew the smoke into the air, after doing this a few times he managed to clear the whole barn of smoke and rescue the people inside. They were amazed and very grateful to Alan for his help.

""However, I mush abide by the rules set for me by my creators. Everything I grant you, I grant tenfold to your husband"".

Now, the woman hated her husband, but she figured she might as well have a little fun, even if her husband gets better. ""My first wish, my dear genie, is to be the richest woman alive"". The genie snaps his fingers, and it is so.

He speaks, ""You do realize that your husband has been given tenfold of what you have received, yes?"" She responds, ""Yes, but he and I are one. What's mine is his and what's his is mine"".

She ponders over her second wish, then decides. ""I wish to be the most beautiful woman alive,"" she says. The genie snaps his fingers and it is so, but the husband becomes 10x as handsome as she is pretty. The genie asks, "" Your husband is now far more attractive than you'll ever be, does that not concern you?"" ""No,"" she responds, ""for I am the prettiest woman alive; he will only have eyes for me"".

Then, she had an idea. An evil, cunning idea, and a dark smile curled her lips. She looked at the genie, and said, ""I wish for a mild heart attack,"" thinking she could kill her husband and take all that is his.

post,auocag,2qh72,jokes,false,1551118647,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/auocag/engineers/,self.jokes,,"Background information:

In India we have long distance trains which are pulled using engines and have toilet facilities, and seats which double as beds. It issues two types of tickets one is to ride the train (used by people to travel short distances, 8-10hrs) and another is to ride the train and have a seat assigned (used for longer distances).

We also have, in certain cities like Mumbai, a local train system, which is electric, has only seats (which people do sometimes use as beds) and no toilet facilities, usually running within the city or to closer by towns a short distance away, usually the entire journey is under 5hrs

Onto the joke.

5 doctors and 5 engineers had to go out of the city, so they had a short 5-6 hour travel in the long distance train. The doctors had purchased a ticket each and the engineers bought 1 ticket and split the cost. The ticket collector (TC) came around to check the tickets. He clipped the tickets of each of the doctors and in the meantime all the engineers went and hid in the toilet. The TC knocked on the door, it was opened ever so slightly and the single ticket was thrust out, the TC checked it, clipped it and gave it back. 

On the return journey, the doctors were angry to have spent money. They decided to use the same trick as the engineers. They bought 1 ticket amongst themselves, the engineers noted this and didn't buy any tickets at all. When the TC arrived the doctors and engineers all went to hide in the toilet. The doctors were smiling thinking the engineers would be fined, when there is a knock on their door asking for a ticket. One of the doctors hands out the ticket and the engineer who asked for it takes it and goes back to the toilet they have hidden in. The real TC comes the engineers repeat the process and their ticket is clipped, while the doctors are asked to step out and are all fined. The doctors are livid.

They reach the city and there is a further train they need to take to reach their work place. The doctors decide they won't but any ticket and will trick the engineers.

Suddenly she sneezes, and her glass eye comes flying out of its socket toward the man. His reflexes kick in and he reaches out, plucks it out of the air, and hands it back to her.

The redhead is mortified. ""Oh my, I am so sorry,"" she says as she pops her eye back into place. ""Let me buy your dinner to make it up to you.""

So he joins her table and they enjoy a wonderful meal together. Afterwards they go to the theatre followed by drinks at a bar. They talk, they laugh, she shares her deepest dreams and he shares his. She listens.

After paying for everything, she asks him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap. He says yes and they return to her place.

He ends up staying the night. The next morning, she cooks a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy is amazed at how everything has been so perfect and how incredible this woman is. He can't believe his luck. ""You know,"" he said, ""you are the perfect woman, are you this nice to every guy you meet?""

one day when they stumble across a big deep hole.

The first guy peers into it and says, ""Wow! That looks deep.""

The second guy says, ""It sure does. Let's throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We'll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.""

So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There's no noise.

The first guy says, ""Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let's throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.""

So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait... Again, nothing.

They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy  gets a determined look on his face and says, ""Hey, over here in the weeds, there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it's gotta make some noise.""

So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, ""Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?""

The first guy says, ""You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!""

""Nah"", says the farmer, ""That couldn't have been my goat. My goat was chained to a railroad tie.""",Two guys are walking through the woods,15
