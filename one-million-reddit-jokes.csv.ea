Putin figures this might be a good time for a drink and he could also find out about the state of his country, so he crossed the street into the bar.


In the bar, Putin sits down, orders a drink, and begins his conversation with the bartender: ""Sir, could you please tell me what century this is?""


The bartender, recognizing Putin, exclaims: ""My god! Mr. Putin, what are you doing here? You died over a hundred years ago!""


Putin chuckles, and says: ""Let's just say I've made a deal with the devil. So, how have things been? How's the country?""

Putin, doubting this, says: ""What do you mean the whole world, what about the Middle East? Nobody conquers the Middle East!""

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a dingy slum,4

post,bz3idh,2qh72,jokes,false,1560201722,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bz3idh/habean_anniversary/,self.jokes,,"There lived a woman in Colorado who had a maddening obsession and passion for baked beans. She loved them, but they always seemed to give her a very embarrassing, and somewhat lively reaction. When it became apparent that she and her boyfriend would marry she thought to herself, ""He is such a sweet and gentle man but I don't think he can live with my problems."" 
So she decided to make the supreme sacrifice and give up beans. 
A year later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country, she called her husband and told him she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she could walk off any disturbing effect by the time she reached home. 
She stopped at the diner, and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. 
Upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her, exclaming delightedly, ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight!"" 
He then blindfolded her then led her to a chair at the table. Just as he was about to remove the blindfold the phone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold till he came back, then he went to answer the phone. 

The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted the weight to one leg, and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelt like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk coming from a pulp mill. She took a napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears turned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signed the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with the napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself, she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned. Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removes the blindfold to reveal twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a first

He walks into the first pub he sees and is greeted by the bartender. The bartender says, ""Hey there, what can I do you for?""

The Swede, eager to take his English for a spin in this new country, orders his favorite drink: ""I'll take a yin, please!""

The bartender grows visibly upset. ""Yin? Yin?! What the hell is that? You're another one o' them lousy immigrants coming through that don't know no good English. Get outta here and don't come back till you can order a drink proper!""

The Swede leaves, feeling distraught, and instead finds work and lodging, putting the drink aside for now. Every night when he returns home from work, he practices his English in the mirror.

""Yin. Yin. Yyy...inn. Jyinn. Jjjiiinn. Gyiin. Giin. Gin. Gin! Gin! GIN!""

After weeks of practice, he's ready. The Swede goes back to that same bar he entered when he first arrived in America. The bar tender recognizes him immediately. ""Hey, it's you again!"" he yells. ""I thought I told you to--""

But the Swede raises a hand and calmly interrupts. ""Yes, I know. I would like to order a _gin_, please.""

The bar tender is speechless! A smile grows on his face, and he says, ""well, would you look at that? You've learned quite a bit! Alright, I'll get you that _gin_, sure thing. What would you like it with?""

So I thought oh brilliant, how that’s £200 down the drain, he exclaimed his sincere apologies and told me to come him once the show was over, and so I waited nearly 2 hours before I then went backstage to see him where he was holding some donuts. So I thought to myself, “donuts?”.

He shows up for his first day and the first mate puts him to work loading crates onto the ship. He finishes a few hours later and they get underway. Richard is put to work and is kept busy all day. After dinner, he approaches the first mate and says, ""Hey. I forgot to ask. What are we even shipping on this trip?""

&amp;#x200B;

The first mate looks at him, pauses for a moment, and says: ""Here. I'll show you.""

&amp;#x200B;

They go down to the cargo hold where Richard was loading crates earlier.  The first mate pries open one of the crates and pulls out the strangest potato Richard has ever seen. It's much longer and skinnier than a normal potato and has a bulge near the top and two bulges near the bottom. The first mate hands it to Richard, who takes it, slightly stunned, and says, ""This looks like a giant...""

&amp;#x200B;

""...Penis, yes."" The first mate finishes Richard's sentence. ""It's called a herm potato. They all look like that. The captain signed an exclusivity deal to ship these. They're all we transport now."" The first mate took the potato back as Richard burst into laughter. ""Go ahead, laugh, get it out now,"" said the first mate, ""You'll be dealing with crates upon crates of these. It's best you get accustomed to them."" After Richard calmed down, they put the potato back and went to their bunks for the night. The next day, they delivered their cargo without incident.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard works on the ship for the next few months without incident. On one of his nights off, he goes to a local bar to have a drink. He strikes up a conversation with the guy sitting next to him and mentions that he works for a shipping vessel. The guy turns to him and says, ""What a coincidence. My usual transport boat cancelled at the last minute and I need some eggs shipped ASAP. I'll be honest, I'm pretty desperate here and you can pretty much name your price."" Richard takes the guy's business card and promises to see what he can do.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, Richard goes to the first mate and explains about the guy at the bar. The first mate shakes his head and says, ""I'm sorry, but the captain signed an exclusivity deal and he takes it very seriously. I wouldn't even bother bringing it up with him."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Richard isn't deterred, however, and brings it up the next time he sees the captain. The captain cuts him off mid-sentence and says, ""No. Absolutely not. We already have a contract and we're not breaking it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Deflated, Richard looks at the captain and says, ""Shouldn't we at least let the crew vote on it?""

A little boy wished for 10 ping-pong balls for his 10th birthday.  
When he turned 11 he wished for 11 ping-pong balls. This continued every year.

They boy grew up to a man. When he turned 18, he wished for 18 ping-pong balls and when he turned 25 he wished for 25 ping-pong balls.

His friends and family never asked about it, but they always wondered why he wished for nothing else. Just ping-pong balls.

When he was 40, he wished for 40 ping-pong balls.

The time finally came for his 50th birthday party and he invited 50 people and said that each of them should bring 1 ping-pong ball each. And they did. No questions asked.

The man turned 60 and guess what he wished for? That’s right. 60 ping-pong balls.

At 70 year old he got 70 ping-pong balls from his beloved wife and children.

At 80 years old, sadly, the man became sick. Very sick. He had to be put in a hospital.

On his deathbed, surrounded by his wife and children his wife asked him:

“My love, tell me. What were you going to do with all the ping-pong balls?”

He smiled at his wife.

“Well” he said. “I was going to use them for..”

We were all over each other and one thing led to another -- before long we were back at my place.
  
&amp;nbsp;
   
I could hear her moan, feel her soaked behind those barely-there panties -- I knew the time was right. So as I kissed her, I raised her arms above her head, revealing immaculately-waxed armpits with the same shade of color as her alabaster skin. She moaned. I continued, slipping the lingerie-masquerading-as-a-little-black-dress she wore off her.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*""Mmmm, she's not faking tit""*, I thought to myself, for her breasts were as big outside her top as they were inside. Easily a C cup. And best of all, they were adorned with the two most glorious glasscutters I had ever laid eyes on. Rock-hard and erupting from those two lucious mounds. In contrast to her pale skin, they looked amost black.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Now I confess. I have a thing for dark nipples. Especially if they stick out like that. So I could not help myself. I would have started lightly with my fingers but I just went for tit. Clamped my mouth straight down on one of those black beauties and went straight to work with my tongue.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Almost instantly, I recoiled, but in pleasure. An inexplicable taste and sensation had spread across my tongue in that short short time I was at work. She looked up at me concerned.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*""Woah. Your tits taste fantastic..""* was all I could manage.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
*""I know right? I smeared peppermint-flavoured lip balm all over them before going out.""*

&amp;nbsp;
 
She leaned forward, and placed the other nipple in my mouth, brushing it against my tongue. That taste again. She moaned.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I find it tends to turn men on..""*
  
&amp;nbsp;

Enough. That was enough. Too much for me -- couldn't take it anymore.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
So I laughed. And I laughed and laughed and laughed. I tried to stop but the most I could get down to was several uncontrollable giggles before roaring in laughter again. She could only look at me, shocked. 
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*""What, you don't like the taste? Or is it the color?""* She seemed offended, on the verge of tears.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I was almost in tears too, but due to all the laughter. Finally I calmed down enough to tell her..
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*""Don't worry your breasts are perfect. It's just that the joke..the real joke is in the coal-mint tits.""*

The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.

The question?... What do women really want? Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.

He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer.

Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.

But the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.

The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first .

The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!

Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life.

He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.

He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.

Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus:


What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.

Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared.

And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding.

The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened .

The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day... or night?

Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments?

What would YOU do?

What Lancelot chose is below. BUT... make YOUR choice before you scroll down below. OKAY? 

Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself.

Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.

Now...what is the moral to this story?

May I ask you - how do you run such an efficient government?  Are there any tips you can give me?” 

“Well,"" replied Her Majesty, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""

Trump frowned. ""But how do you know the people around you are really intelligent?"" he asked.

""Oh, that's easy” the Queen replied. “You just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle”

She pushed a button on her intercom. “Please send Theresa May in here.""

The Prime Minister walked into the room.   “You called for me, Your Majesty?""

""Answer me this, if you would, Theresa. “ the Queen said. “Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?” 

Without pausing for even a second, Theresa May answered, “That would be me.""

""Yes! Very good,” said the Queen.

Trump went back home, returned to the White House and the very next day called for Mike Pence to come and see him.

Pence duly trotted in to the Oval Office .  “Mike, answer this for me,’ said the Don. “Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?” 

""I'm not sure,"" said Pence. “Let me get back to you on that one.

Pence went panicking off to his advisers and asked everyone, but none of them could give him an answer. 

The next night, as it happened, Pence ran in to Hillary Clinton in a restaurant. By now, desperate for an answer to give to his tyrannical boss, he approached her – much to her surprise.

“Hillary, I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye but I would really appreciate it if you could answer this riddle for me

“Sure, Mike “Hillary said. “I’m not one to hold a grudge. What is it?”

“Thanks, said Pence,” It’s this.  Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?” 

Hillary answered right back, “That's easy, it's me!""

Pence smiled,  “Thanks!""

Pence then went back to speak with Trump. ""Say, boss, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle.  It’s Hillary Clinton.”

Trump got up, stomped over to Pence, and angrily yelled at him ""No, you idiot!  It’s Theresa May!""",Donald Trump went to London and met with the Queen.,11

An Irishman is out of work and decides to go to a construction site and apply.  The foreman is an older English fellow who doesn't care for Irishmen, thinks they're drunks and dumb and unreliable. But he knows he can't just come out and say that.

So, the foreman says, ""Now, see here chap!  This operation is not in the habit of hiring just any old sod who applies, you have to show me you have some builder experience and knowledge.  I'll hire you if you can answer some questions.""

The Irishman says, ""Deadly!  I been a builder for donkey's years, Holy joe.  let's have it, then, i'll show you i'm not a dosser!""

The foreman thinks to himself, ""Righto, this geezer's a lota wind.  let's send him packing"".  So he asks:

""Alright, what's the difference between a Girder and a Joist?""

The irishman thinks for a few seconds and grumbles a bit.  He pauses long enough for the Englishman to get a bit of a smirk on his face (as English are wont to do).  Finally, he takes a breath, sucks in his gut, and stands a little straighter to answer:

""One wrote Faust, the other wrote Finnegan's Wake!""",What's the difference between a girder and a joist?,11

He picks himself up and rushes to help, and before him lays a single living man, crushed underneath the debris of the roof. He moves to help the young Brit, using the rest of his strength to pull him out of the rubble. The man's legs are crushed, and his stomach filled with large splinters.

""You're bleeding out, my friend,"" the officer sighs, slumping down next to him. ""Zere is nothing I can do to help you. All I can do is keep you company in your last moments.""

The Brit shakily sighs, breathing heavily as he looks over himself, giving the German a nod. The older man looks up towards the starry sky and speaks: ""Ze stars will calm you.""

They both find themselves looking at the stars, and time passes. Eventually, they see a streak of light across the night sky.

Thinking quickly the parishioner explains that this type of fish is actually called a son of a bitch and for penance he gives it to the priest to take home for his supper.

At home, the mother superior is in the kitchen when the priest walks in and presenting the fish exclaims ""Would you look at the size of this son of a bitch!""

At the Bishop's house they show him the fish and exclaim what a fine son of a bitch this is. The Bishop goes mad until they manage to calm him down and explain that is the fishes name. He relents and then takes a look at the fish, exclaims what a glorious son of a bitch it is and that the pope is coming to dinner and they should serve it as the main course.

Pope comes around and they serve up the giant and very tasty fish. All very proud they take it in turns to share their part in it

The priest boasts ""I helped catch the son of a bitch!""

The Mother Superior beams ""And I cooked the son of the bitch!""

And the Bishop states ""And I thought you should be the person to eat this son of a bitch!""

A cowboy rides home to the ranch and finds that his house is burned to the ground, his horses have all been stolen, his livestock slaughtered, his dogs shot down, his wife raped and murdered and his ranch hands tortured and hanged. One man, barely alive, manages to gasp out before dying: 

""It. . .it. . .was Shanghai Pete."" 

Grief-stricken, the cowboy buries his wife, his ranch hands and his dogs. He then drags all of the livestock to a pit and pushes them in, covering their corpses with lime. Rage begins to set in and the desire for revenge overwhelms him. He mounts his faithful horse and rides for town at a full gallop. 

Pulling up at the saloon in a cloud of dust, he jumps off his horse and collars the first person he sees. Grabbing him and shaking him, he screams in the man's face:

 ""Do you know where Shanghai Pete can be found?!"" 
""In. . .in. . .the s-s-saloon!"" 

Stammers the man. The cowboy storms through the swinging doors and the saloon falls deathly silent. The cowboy scans the room from under the brim of his hat and says: 

""Which one of you low-life, motherfucking sonsabitches is Shanghai Pete, who burned down my house, stole my horses, killed all my livestock, shot down my dogs, raped and murdered my wife, and tortured and hanged all my ranch hands?""

&amp;nbsp;

After addressing the inevitable loss of life, extensive property damage and the smashing of tens of thousands of mirrors, we gathered up the fragments from the craters where they lay. Scientists concluded that they were made from an ancient, inexplicable material and somehow.. *alive*.
   
&amp;nbsp;

We quickly understood, and prepared ourselves for the dialogs that were to follow. It took ten years before the first of them awoke and spoke to us. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*Ents*, we called them. *Otwoks*, *Groots*, *Old Men Willow*. Names from the fairy-tales and games of old. Having spent much of their journey through the cold void of space in slumber, they had little to share with us in the ways of interstellar travel. Instead, they promised, they could offer us the fruits from their boughs, and the air-of-life where their leaves met the light of the yellow-sun. All they would need from us was a place where they and their ones-after could grow.

&amp;nbsp; 

We agreed, and these talking-trees quickly found themselves in their new homes. Walled compounds, regularly irrigated, stretching for kilometres through the desert, alongside our solar-farms. Here, they would see the skies, moon and yellow-sun of our planet, the stars from whence they came, and nothing else. From time to time, we would enter and take what we were promised, and a *bit* more.

&amp;nbsp; 

And so, as we cut them down, tear off their arms, scalp and flay them before throwing their raw, limbless, still-screaming bodies into hastily-refurbished furnaces, we can only wonder. Had they more to share with us, they could have taken part in the right kind of *dialog*.

The host is surprised and replies, ""Excuse me, but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here, I will get the manager as soon as I can."" 

The manager comes over and the dude asks, ""Are you the fucking manager of this shit joint?""

""Yes, sir, I am,"" replies the manager, ""and I would prefer it if you could refrain from swearing in this restaurant.""

""Fuck off!"" replies the dude. ""And where's the fucking piano?"" 

""What?"" says the manager. 

""Fucking deaf are we? You little piece of shit, show me your fucking piano."" 

""Oh, you're here for the pianist job. Can you play any blues?"" says the manager showing the dude the piano. 

""Of course I fucking can,"" and the guy plays the most inspiring and beautiful blues that the manager has ever heard. 

""That's good, what's it called?"" 

""I want to fuck your wife on the couch but the springs keep hurting my balls,"" replies the pianist. 

The manager is disturbed but asks if he knows jazz. So he proceeds to play the best jazz solo the manager has ever heard. ""Great!"" cries the manager. ""What's it called?"" 

""I wanted to fuck your daughter but she's still at school."" 

The manager gets angry but asks if he knows any ballads, he then plays the most heartbreaking melody. 

""And what's this called?"" asks the manager. 

""As I fuck her under the stars, the moonlight shines off her hairy pussy,"" he replies. 

The manager is upset but offers him the job if he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers. This arrangement works well for a little bit, until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde the dude has ever seen. She's wearing a see through dress and her tits are falling out the top. She is sitting there with her legs wide open, staring at him. It's too much for him so he runs off to the restroom to yank one out. 

He's pulling away furiously when he hears the manager yell ""Where's that pianist!?"" He just has time to cum and then he runs back to the piano, not having bothered to adjust himself right, sits down and starts playing his music. 

The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear: ""Do you know your cock is hanging out of your pants and dripping jizz on your shoes?"" 

""Know it,"" he replies, ""I fucking wrote it!""","A dude walks into a restaurant and says,",25448

After people realized I was there I was invited to speak to the chief. I asked what event they were celebrating, and he replied “We are having our annual festival to celebrate the crops we brought in during the growing season. We had just the right amount of rain so we are thanking our rain god with songs and the like. In fact, we are having a contest and you are welcome to join.” With my curiosity piqued, I accept and asked what the completion will entail. The chief explains that this competition involves participants performing a rain dance. If 15 minutes pass and there is no rain, the contestant is eliminated and the new challenger approaches. The process is repeated until a champion is crowned, the “Raining Champion”. I agree to join. As the competition goes on, I see amazing, beautiful, and intricate dances, but none bring rain. Every member of the tribe tries but no rain comes. As the day is nearing its end, the number of remaining competitors dwindle but still no rain. It is nearing my turn. I quickly whisper to the chief that I won’t be able to perform nearly as well as the other members of the tribe, but he gives a quick word of encouragement and then tells me to take the floor. I perform my interpretation of a rain dance. I could tell it wasn’t good, but everyone seems amused to see a white man attempt to rain dance and they clap and thank me for the entertainment of seeing someone flop around in the name of rain. Ten minutes pass and clouds begin forming overhead in the sunset filled sky. A downpour begins. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. This white man who just wandered in a half day before was able to bring the rain. Everyone erupts in a sea of chanting and I am crowned the Raining Champion. We party all night and, I depart with a smile the next day. As I leave, the chief invites me back next year and to stay in touch. They had made a friend in me and I in them. I keep in touch as the year passes. As the day of the new festival comes near, I prepare to embark towards the reservation once more. The competition comes around and by some miracle, when I performed my dorky interpretation of a rain dance, the clouds roll in once more and the downpour arrives. No other member of the tribe could bring rain after that and I was then crowned, the Reigning Raining champion.

Not being one to turn down a nice payday, the man jumps up and says “You’ll never guess my name!”

On a lark, the magician shouts “Rumpelstiltskin!”  The audience chuckles and the man shakes his head.

The magician invites the man on stage and looks him up and down, noticing his jewelry, clothing, and the marks of years of hard labor in the calloused hands.

“With my remaining 4 guesses, I’ll go with… Thomas!”

The man looks at him in surprise and says “That’s my father’s name, and my oldest brother is a junior, but no, that’s not my name.”

“Timothy!”

“No, that’s my cousin, named after my grandfather.”

“Theodore!”

“Nope, not  even close. Nobody in my family has that name.”

The magician calls on the audience, “Besides the lovely woman at this man’s table, can anyone out there give me a guess?”

Shouts of Robert, Steven, Lou, Fred, and dozens of names fly from the voices in the crowd. The magician shakes his head and waves to the audience to quiet down as he gives it a last try… slyly watching the man’s wife from the corner of his eye, in case she responds to any of the shouted names, but she’s a stern poker face and he gets nothing from her.

“Alright, for my final guess… Travis!”

The man smiles, looks the magician in the eye, and holds out his hand. Triumphant, the magician takes it and shakes his hand with delight, jolting across the stage in success, as the man looks at him and waves.

The magician says, “So your name IS Travis then?”

The man says, “No, I was holding out my hand for the Thousand bucks, not to shake yours.”

Shocked the magician asks, “But you’re wearing the letter “T” on that chain around your neck. Is that perhaps  the first letter of your wife’s name? Or your last name?”

Now looking confused, the man says, “Letter “T?” and looks down at his crucifix. “No, my name is Harold Mason, and this is not a Letter “T” but my cross. Are you not a Christian, sir?”

The magician begins laughing hysterically and throws the wad of hundreds in the air, causing a mad dash from the front row audience members as he points to Harold and says, “Somebody call the loony bin! We got grown man who talks to invisible people in the sky!”",The Modern Magician,0

They order an unlimited amount of beer. The server says ""No, we don't really have room for them here, but give them the beers and ask if this bar's bar."" We find ourselves at ""The Cave"", a cave in Ohio that the monks used for meditation during medieval times. The monks lived there for years to cleanse themselves from the diseases of the day. What's more, they spent all day drinking and eating, going to the mountains to explore the earth and so forth, in order to get a better experience when they went back to their rooms. But once the next day they heard that the beer was gone, so they took a few breaks and returned to the caves where the monks had been. As mentioned before, this was centuries before we were told to drink beer, and before we had beer cans back then.
So to answer the question, how much beer did the monks drink during this cave visit? The answer is absolutely nothing. One has to take out a straw and drag it across the floor to get a drink. I am told that this is exactly when they are talking about what they like, and not actually where these beers were brewed. And even then, one has to take some distance from the cave to see it.

Alongside the furniture was a parrot that was left behind, which had earned an experience from looking around and hearing stuff there. So an elderly wife with two children, a son and a daughter, decided to go and look for any good deals there. As she was looking around she found the parrot that was being sold so she decided she would buy and take the parrot home because it would've been a pity if she left it behind. 

So she took the parrot home and left it at the kitchen in its cage. 

So later on the wife went to take something to eat from the fridge. The parrot goes:

""New bawd I see""

Later the daughter went to make some coffee.

""New hoe I see""

After that, the son went to get some water

""New pimp I see""

And then the dad went to make something to eat. The parrot goes:

There was once a priest who went to travel the world after taking his oath. After years of travelling he arrived in a little village far from civilization. The village didn't have a church, the villagers went to the nearest town if they wanted to worship God, it was more than 25 kilometres away.

The priest sought the Church for monetary support and with help from the locals they built their own chuch. From there on, he was giving sermons and masses on Sunday, joining young couples in Holy Matrinomy, and giving prayers at funerals.

This went on for many years.

On an ordinary Sunday at the end of the mass, the priest was herding the people out of the church and he was ready to close the gates when a raggedy man approached him. 

The raggedy man in his dirty and torn clothes stood before the priest and said this to him:

""Priest, please be good and give half a lemon"" - said the man.
The priest was a good man but he thought that the request was a bit odd. He went back inside, cut a lemon in half and gave it to the man.

The priest's curiosity was peaked. The priest asked the ruggeddy man:

""My son, tell me, why do you need half a lemon?""

The man with horror on his face quickly took off before the priest was given an answer.

A week later the ruggedy man returned, and he met the priest at the same place. The ruggedy man said to the priest:

""Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon""

The priest was taken aback by the man and his strange request. The priest was good, so he went back inside, cut a lemon in half, and gave it to the stranger and immediatly asked:

""My son, tell me please, why do you need these lemons?""
The strange man immediately took off, but the priest wasn't giving up easy and he went after the stranger. The priest couldn't keep up with the ruggedy man, because he wasn't in the greatest condition, he almost fainted.

The priest hoped that the strange man would come back next week, so he could know why he needed those lemons.

The priest spent the next week running and training, so he could keep up with the strange man. Sure enough, the training paid off because the man was back on the next Sunday and asked the priest:

""Priest, please be good and give me half a lem-""

The priest didn't even wait for him to finish his sentence he immediately gave half a lemon to the strange man.

""Thank you priest, you are good"" - said the stranger.
""Don't even mention,my child, but tell me, why do you need all these lemons?"" 

The man ran away with terror in his eyes, but the priest was in pursuit of him. They were running for a long time when they reached a river. The stranger, without hesitation, leapt in to the river and swam to the other shore and ran away. The priest didn't follow him because he couldn't swim.

He went home fuming. The priest spent the next week taking swimming lessons in the nearest town's swimming pool.

The next week at the same time the strange man arrived again.

""Priest, please be good and give half a lemon""
The priest went in the back, put in his running shoes and swimming trunks and came out with half a lemon and gave it to the man.

""Here you go my son, but could you please tell why do you need it?""

The strange man quickly started running, they ran and ran and ran until they arrived at the river. The man quickly jumped into the river and swam across it, the priest was right behind him, those swimming lessons finally paid off!

They started to run again until they arrived at tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man with cat like agility climbed the tall tree. The priest didn't follow because he didn't know how to climb trees. He went home cursing at everything.

He spent the next week climbing the tree in the churchyard much to the amusment of the villagers. Before Sunday's mass he put on his swimming trunks and his swimming shorts. The priest was good and he even prepared the lemon and put it in his pocket.

The mass finished much earlier than usual, so he could warm up. As soon as he finished his warmup the strange man approached him yet again. The priest gave him the lemon immediately.

""My son, for God's sake, tell me why do you need lemons?""

The man quickly ran off, the priest was right behind him. They ran to the river and swam across, ran to the ravine and climbed the tree. The priest almost caught him when the stranger grabbed a vine and swung across the ravine. The priest was about to have a brain aneurysm when saw another vine. He quickly grabbed it and swung across the deep ravine. When he got to the other side he suddenly encountered another unexpected obstacle. He arrived in a plane graveyard. The strange locked himself inside one of the grounded planes. The priest went around the plane multiple times but he couldn't find a way inside. He was enraged.

Next week he spent everyday at the village's locksmith, studying every method of opening a lock.

Next Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back a waterproof backpack. In the backpack there was a crowbar, wrench, cutting torch, even lockpicks.

The strange man arrive yet again and asked for the same thing.
The priest quickly gave it to him and grabbed his wrists, looked into his terrified eyes and asked him:

""What do you need these lemons for?""

The stranger started to panic and broke free from the priest. They raced to the river, swam across it, they ran to the ravine and swung across it, but the man locked himself inside another airplane. But the priest didn't stop he quickly got all his tools out of his waterproof backpack and started to work on the lock. Not an hour passed he was inside of the plane. Inside, the ruggedy man was crouched in a corner with horror on his face and terror in his eyes.

The good priest crouched down next to him and kindly asked:

""Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?""

""Alright priest"" - said the strange man in a trembling voice - ""I will tell you but please be good and don't tell anyone""

The priest was good and didn't tell anyone.",The priest and half a lemon,223
