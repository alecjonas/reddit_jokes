The next day the same blonde came up to the counter, and ordered the same thing as last night. 

Will this be for here or to go? I said, curious if she would do what she did yesterday. 

To go she replied, and then went to sit down and eat.

This church was old (the only church the city had for sale, really), but the friars didn't care. They put on some of that good ol' elbow grease and got it looking good again. Once their church was as ready as can be, people started going to their church. Now, the friars were very kind to everyone they met, in and out of the church, and everyone knew them well. The friary was loved by all.

Then came summer. During summertime, the people of this city loved to travel around, so the number of weekly visitors of the friary grew dim - so dim, in fact, that they foretell having to shut down the friary by the end of the summer due to a lack of donations. So the friars put their heads together to brainstorm ideas that could start raking in some money so they wouldn't have to declare bankruptcy. One friar spoke up and suggested they do a yard sale of the untouched junk they found in the abandoned church. His idea was quickly shut down; who'd want to buy a dozen chalices? Another friar suggested they use the yard behind the friary to start growing flowers, and open up a flower shop. The others loved the idea, and within weeks the friars' flower shop, dubbed ""The Green Cross"", was quite successful.

In fact, it was becoming too successful. Since the friars were so well-loved, they started stealing other florists' customers. Quickly running out of business, a few florists got together to discuss how they'd get their customers back. The topic of every suggestion was attacking the friars in some way or another: one florist suggested they egg the friary and their flower shop - which was a flop, since the eggs were gone within hours and the two buildings looked even cleaner than before the incident thanks to the friars. Another florist suggested they trample the friary's flowers - but the friars' customers donated so many of their own home's flowers that it didn't make a difference. Another florist yet suggested they hire Hugh.

Who's Hugh, you ask? Only the baddest eleven-year-old this city's ever seen. He's bullied every kid you've met, vandalized every building at least twice, and rumor has it that he actually pranked someone to death. He's exactly the guy the florists need.

They hire him with the only mission to ""shut down The Green Cross"". Sure enough, come the next day, the flower shop was completely ruined, with all the flowers burning in a pile. The friary, too, was reduced to a pile of stone and dust, and the flower beds behind it were nowhere to be seen. With no chance of recovery, the friars were forced to leave the city with nothing.

The moral of the story: only Hugh can prevent florist friars.","In a city, not so long ago, there used to be a collective of friars.",22

post,9gbr3o,2qh72,jokes,false,1537114407,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9gbr3o/nsfw_voodoo_dick_long/,self.jokes,," Lucia popped into her local South American produce shop on the way home from work (it was enchilada night). While browsing she got a call from her bff Natalie and spent some time talking about the recent divorce, and her lack of sex life. Shortly after hanging up, she was approached by the store clerk, a wizened old Peruvian lady.

 ""Disculpa me, señora"" she said, ""I couldn't help overhearing, but I think I have a solution to your ""troubles"" if you'd like to follow me to the back?"".

 Lucia's curiosity was piqued, so she followed the woman out to a dusty old storage room, filled with boxes, cobwebs, and a lazy looking pit-bull curled up in the corner. 

  ""This arrived the other day, from a small mountain village in Peru"" said the old woman, opening an old wooden box to reveal a smooth, phallic-shaped object, covered in strange markings and symbols. ""It was used to pleasure the old Mayan kings and queens, if rumours are true"".

 ""It was called the Voodoo Dick"" said the woman. ""Very powerful!"". Lucia was unimpressed. ""I have a collection of vibrators at home"" she shrugged ""what use is another?"".

 ""Not like this"", grinned the woman. ""Behold! Voodoo dick, the dog!"".

Suddenly, the Voodoo dick sprang out of the box, into the air, and sailed for the dog in the corner. It penetrated her with ease and began a powerful in-out motion. The dog was rendered almost immobile, though clearly overwhelmed with pleasure.

""Voodoo dick, que pares ya!"" Said the woman, and the Voodoo dick returned obediently to it's box, much to the disappointment of the dog. ""Self-lubricating, self-loading and hands-free"" smirked the woman. Lucia was sold. ""I'll take it!""

 ""Very well! Simply command it where to go, and when you're finished, repeat ""Que pares ya!"" And it will return to it's box"".

 Lucia returned home desperate to go e ir a try. She finally arrived, stripped and lay on the bed. ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" 

The Voodoo dick sprung into action and Lucia was engulfed by wave after wave of the most intense pleasure she had ever experienced. She lost all track of time. Minutes turned to hours, or even days, who could be sure! Now experiencing some discomfort, she figured it was time to take a break.

 But what was the fucking phrase!? The Voodoo dick had pounded the memory out of her, the stream of orgasms had left her mind completely blank. There was only one thing left to do. She waddled as fast as she could out to the car, and set off for the produce shop.

 She was almost there, when suddenly a siren went off and she was forced to pull over. She tried her best to explain the situation to the officer. ""P.. please sir... mmm.... It's th-this v..uuuuu....Voodoo dick... I nee.... Need to go... Please!!...mmm"".

""Yeah right lady"" scoffs the policeman.

Hi, Fred, this is Richard, next door.
I've got a confession to make. I've been riddled with guilt for a few months &amp; have been trying to get up the courage to tell you face-to-face. At least I'm telling you in this text, &amp; I can't live with myself a minute longer without your knowing about this.
The truth is that, when you're not around, I've been sharing your wife, day &amp; night. In fact, probably much more than you.  
I haven't been getting it at home recently, &amp; I know that that's no excuse. The temptation was just too great. I can't live with the guilt &amp; hope you'll accept my sincere apology &amp; forgive me.
Please suggest a fee for usage, &amp; I'll pay you.
Regards, Richard

NEIGHBOUR'S RESPONSE:
Fred, feeling very angry &amp; betrayed, grabbed his gun, went next door, &amp; shot Richard, killing him.  He went back home, shot his wife, poured himself a stiff drink &amp; sat down on the sofa and calmed down. Fred then looked at his phone &amp; discovered a 2nd text message from Richard.

2ND TEXT MESSAGE:
Hi, Fred.

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he 
hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents.

tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.

In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, and Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ...total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts.

a truly heart-warming story about the bond formed between a little 4-year-old girl and some construction workers that will make you believe that we all can make a difference when we give a child the gift of our time. Love the ending!

Young family moved to a house, next to a vacant lot. One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot. The young family's 4-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.

Eventually the construction crew all -gems-in-the-rough,"" more - or - less, adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week they presented her with a pay envelope containing $10. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her $10 ""pay"" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

the girlproudly replied, ""I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.""

""So, you're a politician...""

""Well, yes, is that a problem?""

""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell?"" says the politician.

""Them's the rules,"" says St. Peter, who snaps his fingers, and *WOOSH*—the guy disappears.

He wakes curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, but hears and smells nothing. Just the smell of fabric softener and cut grass... This can't be right, can it?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"" Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too, a penthouse suite. Before him, there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.

""Who are you?"" the politician asks. 

""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!""

""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.

Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service... There's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...""

The politician wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.

So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the politician, as Satan signs autographs and cheerily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20. She throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying on lively discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him.

Later, they return to the hotel dining room for an extravagant five-course meal, each course cooked to perfection and better than the previous one. Afterward, his wife whispers something sensual in his ear, his cue to return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense, passionate sex, the politician collapses on the memory foam pillows with Egyptian cotton pillowcases, and falls into a deep and blissful sleep.

The next morning, he is woken by St. Peter. ""So, that was Hell,"" he says. ""Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""

""No sir!"" says the politician.

""So then,"" says St. Peter, ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, etc.""

""Well... I know this sounds strange, but, to be honest, I think I'd prefer Hell!"" says the politician.

""Not a problem, we totally understand. Enjoy!"" says St. Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The politician wakes up in a cold, dark place with hard, stone floors, the stench of ammonia filling the air. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from a flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people who were burned with sulfur. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.

""What's this?"" the politician cries. ""Where's the hotel?! Where's my wife?! Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine?!""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning—and then you voted.""",A politician dies and winds up standing in front of the pearly gates.,131

When he arrives, he notices that while his wife is quite happy, their son looks miserable, so he pulls the boy aside to ask how things are going.

'He asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and I told him I wanted to be a musician, so he made me listen to this terrible old music, then asked me what I thought about it.  Every time I tell him I don't like it, he gets annoyed and tells me that they're 'classics,' and I should learn to appreciate them.  What the hell does that even mean?  What's the difference between something that's a 'classic' and something that's just old?'

The father thinks about that for a second before replying, 'Classic music may not be what you enjoy, but it's got a place in musical history.  It may not be great, but if it hadn't existed when it did, then we wouldn't have the music that we have now.  and some people think that you have to learn to love it because of what it helped create, if not for itself.  That's kind of what classical means.'

The boy, sighed, shrugged, and the two of them rejoined the mother and grandfather.  They stayed in town for the next three days, all of which were miserable for the son, who was perpetually critiqued and argued with by his grandfather, while his mother seemed to be having the time of her life reconnecting with the old man.

When the time finally came to leave, and they all climbed into the car to drive off, the mother turned to her son and said, 'so, what do you think of your grandfather.'

The boy took a moment to consider before finally replying.  ""He's a classic, mom.""","When he gets ill, and old man contacts a daughter he hasn't seen in years and convinces her to bring her family to meet him before he dies.",14

After a while they retired to his bedroom where he 'rattled' her in spectacular fashion. After a smoke and brief interlude he asked with a smile, ""So, you finish?

She paused for a second, frowned, and replied, ""No.""

Surprised, he reached for her again, and the rattling resumed. This time she thrashed about wildly amid screams of passion.

Finally, he comes to a halt. He smiles and asks, ""You finish?""

Once again, after a short pause, she returns his smile, cuddles closer to him and softly says, ""No.""

Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman unsatisfied, he, mustering all his strength and recuperative powers, cranks up for one final burst. In a wild, monumentally frenetic climax they end together, screaming, snorting, bucking, and ripping at the bed sheets.

Absolutely and completely buggered, he falls onto his back, gasping for air. Barely able to turn his head, he looks into her eyes, smiles proudly and asks again, ""You finish?""

Barely able to speak, the blonde whispers in his ear, ""No, I'm Norwegian!""

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

The day arrives for him to move halfway across the state. The older trees wish him luck, and they make him promise to write. They wave and cheer as he packs his trunk and leaves.

He arrives at his college and after a few days of partying with humans he decides that he never wants to see his boring old forest again. 

The first letter arrives from home and he ignores it. He trims his leaves into a rough approximation of a human hairstyle. Another letter arrives and goes on the pile. He buys low-slung jeans and an Abercrombie hoodie. Another letter arrives. Billy spends half his savings on an Xbox and practises Call of Duty and Madden in order to better fit in. Another letter. Billy takes up smoking, despite the dangers. 

He feels a little weak and notices that his leaves are browning at the edges, but he puts it down to all the jaeger and cheap beer. 

A few other trees in class try to talk to him but he ignores them in favor of his exciting new human friends. He laughs at their bird's nests and old tyre swings and their shitty topiary. He makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with them.

But Billy feels tired all the time! His leaves start to fall off. His knots ache and his branches begin to twist in on themselves. His bark feels loose and starts to slough off at the slightest touch. He's dry, tinder dry. He drops a cigarette and damn near burns his twig-and-berries off. His human friends have no idea how to help and abandon him in his dorm. 

After a few days he's little more than a dry, cracked trunk surrounded by kindling and rotting bark. His roommate brings his mail and dumps it on his desk. He reaches out and opens his latest letter from home.

""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies. ""There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor."" 

So Kevin deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. 

Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. 

That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Kevin began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. 

Kevin hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. 

The computer prints the following:

1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 
4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

He wasn't sure why his parents had given him that name but it had caused him problems all his life and he never liked it. As he grew older he grew to like his name even less and one day he was sitting talking with his wife and said ""Honey you know that I have never liked being named Odd?""
""Yes"", she replied, ""I've seen how you've hated your name over the years.""
""Well I want you to do me a favor."" he told her. ""I've had to deal with this name all my life and out of respect for my parents I never changed it but I'll be darned if I'm going to have this name when I die. When my day comes and you bury me just don't put anything on my headstone. Leave it blank.""
His wife agreed and they went about their lives for several more years before the man finally passed away. The wife honored his request and had a blank headstone placed on his grave.

To this day people who visit the cemetery look over at the blank headstone and say ""That's Odd"". ",There was a man named Odd.,78

Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school.  
After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door. For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.  
This pattern continued ceaselessly until it was time for the first quarter report card. The boy walked in with his report card -- unopened -- laid it on the dinnertable and went straight to his room. Cautiously, his mother opened it, and to her amazement, she saw a bright red ""A"" under the subject of MATH.  
Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at his remarkable progress. ""Was it the nuns that did it?,"" the father asked. The boy only shook his head and said, ""No."" ""Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?"" ""No."" ""The textbooks? The teachers? The curriculum?""

Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange. When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.

When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the spoon?"" Well,"" he explained, ""the restaurant's owners hired Kurt Salmon Associates to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon is the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed.

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.""

""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.""

I knew that McGlynn had a hat just like me hat, and I knew that McGlynn came to Church every Sunday. I also knew that McGlynn had to take his hat off during Mass and figured he would leave it in the back of the Church; so I was going to leave after Communion and steal McGlynn's hat.""

Murphy said, ""Well, after I heard your sermon on the Ten Commandments, I decided I didn't need to steal McGlynn's hat.""

The priest gave Murphy a big smile and said: ""After I talked about 'Thou Shalt not Steal', you decided you would rather do without the hat than burn in hell right?""

Murphy shook his head and said, ""No Father, after you talked about 'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery', I remembered where I left me hat.""
