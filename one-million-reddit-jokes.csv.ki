1. You can only shop once. Ever.
2. The quality of the 'merchandise' increases as you go up a floor (there are 6 floors total)
3. You can choose any product from any floor, but once you go up a floor you cannot come back to the previous floor.

So one day a group of friends decide to give this place a visit. Once they go into the first floor of the store, they are greeted with a sign that says:

WELCOME TO THE FIRST FLOOR: All the men here are average-looking and have no jobs.

The girls just laugh and proceed to the second floor.

WELCOME TO THE SECOND FLOOR: All the men here are good-looking and have decent paying jobs.

The girls go 'That's nice, but let's see what else they've got'. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE THIRD FLOOR: All the men here are good-looking, have decent paying jobs and are excellent in bed.

'Now we're talking!' shout the girls in excitement. 'But we still have three more floors to go, let's see what else they've got' So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE FOURTH FLOOR: All the men here are extremely good-looking, have high-paying jobs so you won't have to work a day in your life, are excellent in bed and they absolutely love kids.

The girls cannot contain their excitement and have half a mind to go into this door but the idea of two more floors is just too enticing. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE FIFTH FLOOR: All the men here are extremely good-looking, have high-paying jobs so you won't have to work a day in your life, are excellent in bed, they absolutely love kids, are super romantic and they will never be unfaithful.

Now the girls are just absolutely squealing and are about to go thru this door when they remember there's still one more floor. 'What could be better than this? Remember we can't ever come back if we leave' they think. But curiosity gets the best from them. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE SIXTH FLOOR: There are no men here. This floor is here just as proof that women are impossible to please. You are the 31,428,474th visitor of this floor. Thank you for shopping with us!

BONUS:

They opened a Wife Store next door with the same rules:

1. You can only shop once. Ever.
2. The quality of the 'merchandise' increases as you go up a floor (there are 6 floors total)
3. You can choose any product from any floor, but once you go up a floor you cannot come back to the previous floor.

FIRST FLOOR: All the women here won't nag you a day in your life.

To this day, nobody knows what's in the second floor.

“Well... it’s a bit embarrassing. It’s called, “I took the next door neighbours wife out into the garden, and screwed her brains out all night long”. “It helps me to remember the songs you see”. 

The owner is a little taken back, and asks him to play another song. 
The song is absolutely incredible, like angels are playing the piano. Again the owner asks the name of the song, and finds its called, “I love to watch the local shopkeeper bend his missus over the counter, and fuck her with a cucumber” 

The owner shakes his head, and tells the man, “you’re hired, but please don’t tell anybody the names of the songs. I’ll see you on Saturday night for your first shift.”

Saturday rolls around, and the man walks in, sits down at the piano, and starts to play. Every key he presses is the wrong one, the song is awful and the crowd start murmuring. The owner pulls the man aside, and asks what the problem is. 
“Well what it is, I’m really really nervous, and struggling, the only thing that will calm me down, is if I can go into the back room and masturbate, then I’ll be able to play perfectly again. 

The owner shakes his head wondering what he has gotten himself into, but reluctantly agrees and ushers him into the back room. 10 minutes later, the man walks back out, and sits down. He starts to play the most beautiful piece of music, and the whole crowd are in awe. As he finishes the piece, a little old lady near the front, walks up the the stage and tells the man. “Do you know, your cock is hanging out of your trousers, and dripping cum all down your leg?”

“Know it!” Says the man.

“Nah me ol’ boy, i don’t much think you should be doin’ that.” “That’s Farmer Skinner’s lil un, and the last poor sod to even touch the lass had his noggin’ near blown off!

“Coooorrrrrrr blimey! Bugger me!!” the old farmer squealed. “Would ya look at this ere sweethart!!? I would ‘appily surrender every last penny to have this ere lass polish off me front-end loader!!”

The old farmer’s mate took a long look and paused, before finally he shrugged and said “i think you’re goin’ daft on me mate.” “but if you’re real serious bout’ all this then why don’t you try yer luck and see what ‘appens?”

The old farmer’s eyes lit up and to his pal’s surprise the old farmer marched on over to the redhead and emptied his pockets in a desperate bid for a moment of unrivalled glory. The old farmer’s mate stood stunned and watched as the old farmer and the redhead agreed terms and hurried out the back of the market.

Less than 15 minutes had passed when finally the old farmer skipped gleefully back over to his mate. Grinning like a young school boy the old farmer exclaimed “that there was the best ere money i ever will spend in me whole bleddy life!!!” 
The old farmer’s mate stood in silence. 

The old farmer jestfully rolled up his sleeves and chuckled assuredly “Go on then me ol’ mate, i know you’re hankering to tell me!” “whose the poor ol’ da i should be on the lookie-out for now then?”

The old farmer’s mate looked pale but there was deep concern in his voice as he spoke “Well” he stammered, “I wouldn’t want to upset ye”....



“but that there redhead, is me son.”

During the long cross-Atlantic journey, many captains worried about their men after so much time away from their wives.

One devoutly Catholic captain was especially concerned that his men might resort to homosexuality during their long voyages. To protect against this sin, he mandated that every sailor masturbate daily into one of several large, empty barrels.

After each trip, the captain took the barrels on his cart to the municipal dump. One day, as he made one of his regular trips, the local candlemaker greeted him from outside his shop.

""What ya got there, Captain?""

""Well,"" confessed the captain, ""I've got three barrels full of seamen's semen."" A bit embarrassed, he explained his reasoning to the candlemaker.

""I see,"" the candlemaker replied. He paused. ""You know, I could make some find candles with all that semen.""

""Really?!""

""Yes. In fact, I'll pay you for it!""

The captain was surprised but grateful for the added income. Soon, he began making his sailors masturbate twice each day, and the barrels of seamen's semen grew in number with each voyage. Then, he stopped fishing altogether. He simply took the men out to sea and had them fill as many barrels as they could.

Proud of his latest and record haul, the captain took three carts of seamen's semen to the candlemaker. Expecting his largest-ever payday, the captain was surprised to find the candlemaker sitting glumly on a stool.

""Captain,"" the candlemaker confessed, ""I can no longer use your seamen's semen.""

""What?!"" replied the captain. ""I didn't even fish this last expedition. This is my only haul.""

""I'm sorry, Captain. I just...can't.""

""Why the hell not?"" the captain demanded.

But when they tried to discuss what they should name the child, it was causing all kinds of arguments. They just couldn’t come to an agreement and there was a lot of tension between them. It got to the point where the wife was staying over at her parents' house every other evening.

About a month after the arguing started, the husband gets an idea. He immediately calls his wife to tell her. “Honey, I know this sounds crazy, but just hear me out for a second. What if we had an auction and sold the right to name our kid to the highest bidder?” She is hesitant at first, but, knowing they would never come to an agreement, she decides that this is actually a great solution. 

They decided to go through with it. The husband has some experience coding and whips up a simple webpage where you can bid on this auction. If you win, you’ll have the right to name their kid, as long as it isn’t anything obscene. A local news station picks up the story and they become pretty well known locally.

So, it’s 8½ months into the pregnancy. The baby has been developing healthily and the auction is about to come to an end. When bidding finally closes, the winning bid is actually from a lip balm company named “Butter Lips.” The kid's full name is going to end up being “Butter Lips Bradley.”

It was finally time to deliver the baby. Labor went well, ending just under six hours. Two days later, they’re all rested up and ready to be released and head home. They wrap up the kid and drive back home from the hospital.

When they get home, they go to unwrap the baby, and, to the shock of all involved, it’s not their kid! “Man,” they said, “I can’t believe it’s not Butter!”",Did you hear about the parents that auctioned off the right to name their firstborn child?,11

So, when it's time for the final, they decide not to study on the weekend before, but to drive to another friend's birthday party in another city - even though the exam is scheduled for Monday morning. 

As it happens, they drink too much at the party, and on Monday morning, they are all hung over and oversleep. When they finally arrive on campus, the exam is already over. They go to the professor's office and offer him an explanation: ""We went to our friend's birthday party, and when we were driving back home very early on Monday morning, we suddenly had a flat tire. We had no spare one, and since we were driving on backroads, it took hours until we got help."" The professor nods sympathetically and says: ""I see that it was not your fault. I will allow you to make up for the missed exam tomorrow morning."" 

When they arrive early on Tuesday morning, the students are put by the professor in a large lecture hall and are seated so far apart from each other that, even if they tried, they had no chance to cheat. The exam booklets are already in place, and confidently, the students start writing. The first question - five points out of one hundred - is a simple exercise in algebra, and all four finish it within ten minutes. When the first of them has completed the problem, he turns over the page of the exam booklet and reads on the next one: 

Problem 2 (95 points out of 100): Which tire went flat?",Four Friends,18

Before the man can stop him, the dog has swallowed the object. A flash of blinding white light temporarily blinds the man, and when he looks back he is amazed to see his dog say ""Hello!"" to him.

""You can talk?"" the man asks.

""I can now. You see, that was a magical orb sent from space that grants animals the ability to talk like humans. Follow me, there is much I want to tell you about the way us dogs live our lives.""

Utterly bemused, the man decides to follow his dog. They walk into a nearby woodland area, when the dog stops by a sign and pisses on the ground beside it. ""This is a piss post."" he explains. ""Whenever we dogs see a piss post, we have to stop and wee against it.""

Later on, the dog walks past another sign, the bottom of which is covered by overgrown grass. Grunting can be heard from within the grass. ""This is the love post, where dogs go to... you know"" explains the dog before quickly moving on.

They carry on walking through the woods, finding many more posts as they go, such as the food post, where campers in the wood would leave their leftovers for dogs to eat, the rabbit post, where the dogs could chase rabbits away from, and the sleeping post where dogs could rest in a quiet area in the woods.

Finally, they arrived at a clearing, where the man saw a hundred foot pole shooting into the sky. Adorned on the pole were beautiful drawings, and flowers and fruit grew on the vines coming off it. At the base of the pole however, there was a large pile of dog turds.

""What is this?"" the man asked in wonder, to which the dog replied:

""This is a long and elaborate shit post""

Screaming, she stands up in the front of the plane. ""I'm too young to die!"" she wails. Then she yells, ""Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I've had plenty of relationships in my life, but no one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well I've had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN?"" 

For a moment there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril and they all stare riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. 

Then, a business man stands up in the rear of the plane. ""I can make you feel like a woman,"" he says. 

He's gorgeous. Well-dressed, tall, built, with flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves. The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches. 

He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers:

Will waited in the nutritionist’s office until he finally walked in the door. Will was eager to speak with him. 

“Well hi Mr. Nutritionist! As you can see, I’m very fat. I’d like to lose this weight and live a healthy life.” Will said.

“Of course,” said the doctor, “we’ll put you on a diet, a very strict one. You’ll need to be weighed every thirty minutes.” 

“Wow, every thirty minutes?” Will looked confused, but he decided to listen to the Nutritionist and carry around a scale so he could document his weight loss just like the Nutritionist said. 

Over the next four years Will was weighed 16,128 times, and didn’t lose a single pound. 

Will returned to the Nutritionist and complained, “Mr. Nutritionist, I haven’t lost any weight, I feel like giving up.” 

“Everything’s going to be fine,” said the Nutritionist. I’m going to get you a shiny brand new scale and we’re going to overhaul your entire diet. No dairy at all.” 

Well, that sounded good enough for Will, and when he began using his shiny new scale he polished it every day. 

Two more years went by and he weighed himself another 8,064 times without losing a single pound. He decided to go back to the Nutritionist again.

“Mr Nutritionist, I *still* haven’t lost any weight! It’s been two years and my shiny scale has started losing its shine.” 

The nutritionist looked upset, but still determined. “Well, you need a more precise scale. I have just the thing. It’s a pair of shoes that weigh you at all times. You never have to carry around a scale, and you’ll always be able to see your weight. Also, you aren’t going to eat anything but lima-beans.” 

Will was sure that this would work. He got his fancy new shoes and he started his Lima-bean diet the next day. 

Another year went by and he never saw his weight go up or down a single pound. He decided to visit the Nutritionist one last time for help.

“Mr. Nutritionist, I’ve been trying to lose weight with you for seven years and I haven’t seen my weight go up or down a single pound. I just think I need to give up.” 

The Nutritionist was clearly upset and confused why no treatment has worked for his client. “We’ll try one last time and I think it’s going to work for sure. Where there’s a Will there’s a weigh.”

He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. 
As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. 
The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it."" 
The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here."" 
The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in Canada and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""
The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in Alberta. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule.' The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?"" The Farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up."" 
The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. 
He agreed to abide by the local custom. 
The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. 
His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees! 
His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. 
The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie. 
Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet. 
Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, ""Okay, you old fart. Now it's my turn."" 
The old farmer smiled and said, ""Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.""**",A lawyer joke,16

St. Peter stopped them and said, ""I can't let you in.""

The second pastor, a United Methodist pastor walked up to St. Peter with his two daughters and was told, 
""You can't get in either, I'm afraid."" 

""Well, why not?"" the pastor asked. 

""Because you loved drinking more than God.""

While they were having sex again, the duck got
loose and ran out into the road. They saw the duck escape and pulled their pants on but not quickly enough to prevent the duck from getting run over by a car. The driver jumped out of the car and said ""I'm so sorry I killed your duck. I'll give you $40 dollars to make up for it.

post,82wnt0,2qh72,jokes,false,1520506489,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/82wnt0/heaven_is_a_big_place/,self.jokes,,"Three guys arrive at the pearly gates together having all perished in different circumstances. Seeing the lineup they all wonder what separates them from access into the gates of heaven. As time goes by the line disappears and the three men find themselves next up. Peter is standing with a hand on the VIP rope seemingly ready to grant entry into the vast bounty that is heaven. 

The first man, standing in front of Peter looks him in the eye and says “How do I get into this party?”

Peter answers him dead pan “One question. I know you were married, just like the next two candidates behind you. So why don’t you tell me, did you ever cheat on your wife?” 

The man shifts on his heels and rocks back and forth for a few seconds then realizes that no answer he gives will be accepted unless he tells the truth, and that this is his only opportunity to tell his story. 

“I was on the road most of my life. For 40 years I traveled the country selling vacuums and while the life sucked I tried very hard to stay virtuous. In all my time there was only one time where I was tempted and I must admit temptation got the better of me and forever since then have I felt the sting of remorse because I lay with another woman and betrayed the trust and promise I made to my wife when we married.”

Peter sighed, lifted the rope and allowed the man access into heaven. “Without this moment of indiscretion you have lived a pure, simple life and for that I am going to give you a Ford Pinto. It has 1,000,000 miles on the clock, has a broken tail light, but otherwise runs ok.”

The unfortunate cheater took his car into the majestic realms of the afterlife knowing this was his burden to hold for now until eternity. 

Meanwhile candidate number two is standing next to Peter with a glint in his eye and asks if he is able to be given the same ultimatum. 

Peter agrees and asks “How about you Marvin? Did you ever cheat on your wife?”

“No”, exclaims Marvin. “I was on the road a lot like the last guy. I listened in your conversation and while I was away a lot traveling I was always able to trust myself and my wife.”

“Hmm. Actually Marvin, as I have seen it, the truth is you were tempted on one trip away from home. You were offered a night of passion with a blond woman who approached you in the hotel bar and you walked with her to your room before you chickened out and skulked into your room alone, leaving her stranded in the hallway. So as I see it you were ready to cheat and therefore by default  you did. My judgement is you have a 2 year old hybrid electric Prius with 30,000km on the clock. “

Marvin idles in his used vehicle feeling the gravity of his choices before switching gears and pulling away gently and driving into the sunset, with hidden but rapidly surfacing regret in his reflection staring back from the rear view mirror.

Bryon is the last of the three to find Peter asking the same simple ruse, “Did you cheat on your wife?”

Bryon looks Peter full into his eyes, tips his head back and laughs. Understanding that his transition into heaven can only be one filled with joy and celebration he joyfully motions Peter to listen closely, fixating on reminding him of the one universal life altering question previously posed to his predecessors. 

“You asked both those guys if they had cheated on their wives. I have never done this, not pursued any woman out of marriage, not so much as looked in another woman’s direction out of curiosity or lust. How do you answer that Peter?”

The gate keeper gazes keenly upon him and repeats his primary question. 

“Did you ever cheat on your wife?”, he ventured.

“Never!!! I never considered it for a moment, because I always knew the bond with my wife was inseparable and our trust was the bond pulling us together every day to eternity. Mine was a love both pure and glorious. Ours was a love eternal.”

Peter pulls his hand upwards and reveals the key to a new Bugatti Veyron. The clock has -20 miles on it and the seats are still covered in the plastic wrap with the new car smell permanently impregnated into the fabric of the vehicle. Our hero starts the motor, and it purrs into life with a triumphant growl. He slips into gear and disappears into the ether.

Two weeks later, and by the coincidence gifted those in a celestial dwelling, all three men arrive at a four way crossing in their allocated vehicles. Putting their surprise aside both of these men with their Prius and Pinto find their most righteous brother sitting on the hood of his Bugatti, tears flowing freely from his face.

“I was fine for days, so happy knowing that I was one of the purest men in this place. That all changed yesterday when I saw my wife on a skateboard “.

In his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed.

This scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed.

Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state.

During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go.

It was unlikely that at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another job.

Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than thirty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly $1 million.

Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth over $2 million.

She explained that she had 'charged' him for sex, and these were the results of her savings and investments.

The husband was so astounded he could barely speak.

Finally he found his voice and blurted out, 'If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have had sex only with you.'

That's when she shot him..

post,82uruz,2qh72,jokes,false,1520482701,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/82uruz/im_never_going_to_parties_again/,self.jokes,,"Alright so

So there's this young man, right. Almost 18.

And he's going into his first party ever.

So he gets there and it's alright for a while. The host of the party, another dude whose parents aren't home is there and all.

But after a few hours, the party starts to get maybe a bit *too* wild.

The host starts doing drugs under the kitchen sink with one or two other people and just starts tripping.

And a few of the guests are just either listening to music really loudly and singing along really annoyingly or eating probably way too much food.

So our guy starts getting a bit uncomfortable, and he thinks to himself:

""Man...I need to breathe. I'm going to the bathroom.""

So he goes there, and since it's just a normal house bathroom both guys and girls are using it (not at the same time, of course) because it was poorly planned and they didn't divide the bathrooms or whatever.

So he goes into the bathroom and there's a girl there, inside the shower.

And she's just removing the shower's drain thingie and vomiting into it, because the toilet was clogged and there was a bunch of stuff on top of the sink.

Naturally disgusted, he leaves the bathroom too and goes outside, into the backyard.

It's nicer in there, there's not a lot of issues, and just a few lads cooking some barbecue. The smell of smoke ain't nice but it's better than vomit.

So he stays there for a while, chills, just drinks his punch. No one seemed to have peed in the punch so that's great.

And after a while, when he feels he's starting to feel less nauseated, something happens.

One of the host's buddies is going crazy from all the drugs and just rans insanely out into the backyard.

So he just comes in and kicks the pot where they're roasting the barbecue. Firey charcoal everywhere and sparks and uncooked/cooked meat.

The grass starts burning.

So, quickly, he just runs out of the backyard and looks for the first liquid that he can to put out the fire.

It's the bowl of punch.

He takes it there, throws it all on the fire and the flames almost explode.

*He had gotten the punch just in time before someone put lots of alcohol in it.*

From there, it just goes downhill and the rest of the party is a mess of the same caliber.

Our friend leaves earlier than the other irresponsable oversized babies.

So he gets on his car and he just has this massive headache. And filled with regret, he walks into a drugstore so he can get some medicine for himself.Clear that headache, that sorta thing.

So while he looks for some Tylenol or some stuff, he finds something different.

Amnesiacs.

He just really wants to forget this party ever happened, so he takes them to the pharmacist.

He tries to buy them, but the pharmacist says:
""I can't give you that without a prescription.""

And that's where he bribes the man with the remainder of his cash to give him the things, alongside some talk about how regretful he is.

So he leaves, gets into his car, and writes himself a note:

***""Never go to parties again.""***

***""Go. Home.""***

And so he places it at the front of his steering wheel and takes the amnesiacs.

In a few moments, he forgets about the party and just sees the note there.

He drives back home still feeling like trash, which just strengthens his resolve to never go to a party again.

He gets home, and as he goes in, taking all the medicine in his arms, which is just way too much of it, he walks through the living room, where his sister is, watching TV on the couch.

She sees him and just goes:

""What is this, brother?""

""Medicine.""

She, worried, walks up to him and takes a few from his hands.

""Brother, how much did you spend on amnesiacs?""

""More than I can remember.""","""I'm never going to parties again.""",0

Carl was a lone survivor. It had been 2 years 3 months and 5 days since the start and he was still going strong, he guessed he was just lucky. 

He was down to his last bullet. Ammo had practically run dry about a year ago. Like most, he relied heavily on his trusty machete. He needed to find somewhere new to take shelter; you don’t stay in one place for long, not these days, so he started to walk. 

The road ahead was blocked by a crowd of them, moping around, groaning for a meal. He decided to cut through the forest and edge his way past them, but out of the corner of his eye he caught glimpse of a building. He ventured closer and realised it was a prison. The place was full of people, all armed with knives and daggers.

The settlers were friendly and took him in. As the day passed, Carl let down his guard, he was safe here, for now.

That night, they heard groans approach the prison. Suddenly a scream was heard from within, “the dead! THE DEAD!” The Zombies had broken in. 
After a few minutes they had already overrun the prison. The settlers did all they could but their weapons just weren’t up to the task and everyone was killed, apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who escaped as the last few were being eaten alive.
 
Stumbling through the night, with zombies close on his tail, Carl discovered a huge shopping mall. The settlers let him inside. They were armed to the teeth with swords, axes, spears and guns, more guns then he’d ever seen with stashes of ammo.

Carl warned them that there was a large pack of zombies following him. They checked, a few had turned into hundreds and were now headed straight for the mall. The settlers fired every weapon they had, but wave after wave ploughed on through the wall of bullets and the ammo ran dry. They broke through the barricades, the settlers fought hard, but they were all slaughtered. All apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who had eluded death once again.

He ventured deep into the dark wood, stumbling through the overgrown foliage, with an Armageddon of zombies behind him, he ran into a huge wooden wall. As he got closer to the entrance, he saw a chicken dressed in military fatigues. The chicken scratched its feet on the floor, clucked three times and pecked on the huge wooden gates. They opened with an enormous “Creeeeek”. Inside was a farm, an old redneck farmer and his wife. “nice ta meet ya sonny”, said the farmer, “come on in ayn' ava drink”

Carl immediately warned them that there were hundreds of zombies chasing him, maybe even thousands by now, but they didn’t seem bothered at all. “We need to do something! Have you even got any weapons?” Carl shouted... 

“Naw, we won't need em”, said the farmer

“The chick’n will deal with em” said his wife, calmly.

Carl was anxious, but he was fed up of running and wanted to see what this chicken could do, so he watched in anticipation... 

The Zombies approached, and one by one the chicken took them down. It pecked through their zombie brains, battered off their heads and kicked the living dead crap out of thousands of them.

Amazed, Carl said, “I’ve just seen that group of zombies tear through two settlements, armed to the teeth with an incredible arsenal of weapons, and your chicken has just taken all of them all out single handed, how? how did that just happen!?”

“Well”, said the farmer, “we figured t’out a long time ago. We dun' need any weapon’s at all, for the Hen is mightier than the Horde.”",Carl woke up.,214

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a make a tweet, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Who doesn't know Dave?,3

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

“No problem…just like Ottawa in June,” the man says.

So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Ottawa man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.

So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.
He says, “No problem. Just like Ottawa in August.”

Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.

When he goes back now to see how the Ottawa man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Ottawa man replies…..

post,82oxn2,2qh72,jokes,false,1520435372,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/82oxn2/the_monk_story/,self.jokes,,"I was driving my car down the interstate one day when the engine broke down. I pulled over to the side of the road. This elderly man in a veryong orange robe pulled over and asked if I needed anything. It was late on a Saturday and I had nowhere to stay. The nice old man offered me to stay the night at his place and he would call his personal mechanic in the morning. 
He drives me to a huge mansion and guided me to a guest room. 
""You can stay here for the night and we'll get everything situated in the morning"". 
He gave me a little bow and walked away. 
2 hours later and I'm having trouble falling asleep. I keep hearing some kind of buzzing noise so I decided to get up and investigate. Once I get to a door that seems to be hiding the source of the sound, the old man jumps out of nowhere and blocks my path. 
""No! Only monks can see what is behind this door"" 
This really made me curious. ""How do I become a monk?"" 
""You must pass a series of rigorous tests!"" He said 
""Well bring it on!!"" I responded. 
""The first test, you must tell me how many starts are in the sky. You only get one chance so count carefully."" 
I spent the next few months diligently outside counting the stars in the night sky. I triple and quadrople checked my answers until I was sure I was as close as possible. I returned to the monk and presented him with my answer. ""you are close enough for that to be considered a pass. Are you ready for the next task?"" 
""Hell yeah!"" 
My next task was to collect 100 teeth from live sharks in the Pacific. After 4 years of fighting with sharks and collecting their teeth, I finally had enough to return to the monk. 
""You have shown good diligence. I am proud to present you with the title of monk. "" 
""Awe hell yeah! I'm off to that goddamn door!"" I was so excited!!
I start walking down the hallway and there were pictures of what seemed like all the other previous monks. I get back to the door I was blocked out from years ago. I stare at all he markings on the door for awhile, basking in the moment of all that I've achieved. The detail in the door was amazing. The way the monks represented their people through drawings left me in awe. I take a deep breathe and head into the door and into the source of the sound that's kept me driven for 5 years. 
You wanna know what I saw?

The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice, holding back his tears.

Abandoning his heritage wasn't an easy decision after all. He told the receptionist he can't do it and Ling was visibly relieved.
The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her.  Just a stupid small town law.

His sister was about to hand it to the receptionist when suddenly a short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Looked like a tourist who went full 'Murica.
Ving turned around and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

Hold on to that fee, Ling""",The tale of my chinese friend and his struggles,160

The customers have heard tales of their existence, but most have never seen a lich before. The lich plops himself down at the bar counter, a few seats away from a human warrior and his busty mage companion. They exchanged looks.

""Whoa,"" the mage whispered. ""It's an actual skeleton.""

The warrior nodded his head, eyes narrowing. ""I think we've met before.""

The two watched as the lich ordered a drink. When it arrived, he downed it quickly. Funnily enough, the liquid didn't end up trickling down his bones.

""It is him!"" The warrior exclaimed. 

The mage watched as the warrior stormed over to the lich. They ended up arguing furiously. To her bewilderment, the skeleton started blushing. Ignoring the biological impossibility of that, the warrior pressed on, getting angrier and angrier by the second. The mage, being curious, walked over and sat herself next to them.

""...I told you, it wasn't me!"" The lich argued, skull still glowing red.

""But you're blushing! You know we slept together that one time!"" the warrior protested.

""I'm not blushing! And I'm. Not. Gay! I am NOT into men!""

The lich paused, as if he were trying to recall something. 

""If we did sleep together, I was probably drunk. And you definitely were too! I mean, you're pretty cute but why would we even..."" 

He trailed off. The three stared at each other. 

""Uh,"" the lich continued lamely. ""Cute, but in a platonic way, I mean. Because I'm not gay. And we have not slept together. Ever.""

The warrior stared at him indignantly. 

Before the situation could escalate, the mage waved her hands frantically. ""Boys! Boys! Stop fighting!""

And again, after a short pause, she just says “No.”

Stunned, but still acting reflexively on his macho pride, he once again puts out the cigarette and entertains his companion du jour. This time, with all the strength he can muster up, he barely manages to end the task, but he does, after expending quite a lot of time and energy.

The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process.

After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he had decided to call it a day.

Just then, an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer's job.  The bishop was incredulous.

""You have no arms !""

""No matter,"" said the man.  ""Observe !""

And he began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon.

The bishop listened in astonishment; convinced he had finally found a replacement for Quasimodo.

But suddenly, as he rushed forward to strike the bell, the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below.

The stunned bishop rushed down two hundred and ninety five church steps. When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before.

As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked,

""Bishop, who was this man ?""

""I don't know his name,"" the bishop sadly replied, “But his face rings a bell.”

The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of Notre Dame.

The first man to approach him said, ""Your Excellency, I am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday.  I pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.""

The bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and, as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest, twirled around, and died on the spot.

Two monks, hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side.

""What has happened ?  Who is this man ?"" the first monk asked breathlessly.

""I don't know his name,"" sighed the distraught bishop, ""but... He’s a dead ringer for his brother.”","After Quasimodo's death, the bishop of the Cathedral of Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that a new bell ringer was needed.",15

'Son,’ said the father. ‘I’m so proud of you. You’ve got a great start on life and I know you’ll be great one day. As a reward, I’ll buy you anything you want. You name it; I’ll buy it for you. What do you want?’

‘Well Dad, I saw these two pink and purple polka dotted ping-pong balls that I kind of want.” Suggested the little boy. His father shook his head.

‘Son, you’ll learn later that there are things you want, and things are a waste of money. This is one of those things. Pick something else.’ Said the dad. So the boy did”

Then the son graduated from elementary school. He was top of his class every year and was the star of all of the sports teams that were there. His future was looking bright.

‘Son, I’m so proud of you. You’re doing so perfect in life already. I want to make you happy so I’ll buy you anything you want. You name it; I’ll buy it for you. What is it?’

‘Well Dad, I still kind of want those two pink and purple polka-dotted ping-pong balls.’ Answered the son. The dad rolled his eyes.

‘Son, you don’t want those. It’s stupid. Pick something else.’ Insisted the father. So he did.

Then the son was out of high school. He was valedictorian and the start of football, basketball, baseball, and the other teams. He was dating the most beautiful girl in the school and he had been accepted to the top college.”

Now the son was graduating from college. Once again, he was at the top in everything. He was active in the community and was still doing sports. He was even still dating his high school sweetheart. His father was so proud.

‘Son, I’m so proud of you. Your life is at your fingertips. No one can stop you now. I want to buy you any thing you want. You name it. I’ll buy it for you. What do you want?’ asked the father.

‘Well dad, I still have my eye on those two pink and purple polka-dotted ping-pong balls. I really want them.’

The dad sighed. ‘Son, that’s a stupid thing to ask for. Please pick something else.’ Pleaded the dad. So he did.

Then he was getting married. It was to his high school girlfriend. She was still very pretty and was also very smart. It was a match made in heaven.

‘Son, I’m so prod of you. You and your new wife will have a great life together and I know you’ll be happy together. I want to buy you two something special. You name it. I’ll buy it for you. What do you want?’

‘Dad, we’d really be happy if we had those two pink and purple polka-dotted ping-pong balls for our marriage.’ Said the son.

‘Son, this is getting old. You know that the answer will be no. I’m begging you. Pick something else!’ So he did.

Then, he was having his very first child. The baby was just the right size and as healthy as could be. The dad was so excited to be a grandfather.

‘Son, I’m so proud of you. Your new baby will live a charmed life with its beautiful parents. I want to make you and your new family happy. So I’ll buy you anything you want. You name it. I’ll buy it. What do you want?’

‘Dad, my child and wife would be happy for me if I could just get those two pink and purple polka-dotted ping pong balls.’

‘Son, that’s pathetic. You’re willing to give up this chance for your own personal gain and not the gain of your family? Please, please pick something else!’ So he did.

Then he’s lying on his deathbed. He’s suffering from cancer and the doctors can do nothing to help him. The son was on the edge of death when his father came to visit him for the last time.

‘Son,’ he said in between tears. ‘I love you so much. You’ve had a great life. No one can ever take your place. You’re leaving behind a sweet wife and child, but it’s probably for the best. No father, though, wants to see his only son die unhappy. Let me buy you anything you want. You name it. I’ll buy it for you. What do you want?’

‘Dad, all my life, I’ve wanted those two pink and purple polka-dotted ping-pong balls. Won’t you please buy them for me now that I only have barely days to live?” begged the son. The dad sighed.

‘Son, no! That’s a waste of time. Pick something else! Why do you want them anyway?’ asked the dad.

‘Well because… because…’ And he died",There was once a boy who was born into a very rich family.,34

This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colours. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean’s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.

He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.

Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn’t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there’s no punch line.",The story of the wasp,0

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?” The monk graciously accepts him, feeds him dinner, and even fixes his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. 

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, 

“Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. 

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

post,82lky8,2qh72,jokes,false,1520397039,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/82lky8/the_infamous_one_about_the_cheerio/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time there was a cheerio named Less-Than-Average Cheerio Joe. 

He lived in the Less-Than-Average Cheerio world. There were three worlds: Perfect Cheerio world, Average Cheerio world, and Joe’s home, Less-Than-Average cheerio world. Perfect Cheerio world, of course, was the world all cheerios wanted to visit; unfortunately, not many were able to, because you had to be perfect to live there. 

Less-Than-Average Cheerio Joe’s one wish was to go to Perfect Cheerio world. It was all he ever wanted. He dreamed about it at night, and woke up knowing that the real Perfect Cheerio world was a hundred times better than anything he could imagine. Even though he was gluten-free and whole-grain, he still knew that the Perfect Cheerio world was where he was truly meant to be. 

One day he found a magic lamp. He rubbed it. Out came a genie. 

‘Less-Than-Average Cheerio Joe!’ the genie said. ‘As a reward for freeing me from that lamp, you may ask anything of me, and I will grant it to you.’

Less-Than-Average Cheerio Joe hardly had to think. ‘I wish I was a Perfect Cheerio,’ he said. The genie snapped his fingers, and, in a puff of whole grain oats, Cheerio Joe was perfect and in Perfect Cheerio world. 

He looked around. The place was amazing. 

A random cheerio tapped him on his soluble-fiber shoulder. ‘You’re new here, right?’ he asked. ‘I’m Bob. I’ll show you Perfect Cheerio world’s attractions.’

‘I’m Less-Than-Average Cheerio Joe,’ Joe said automatically. 

Bob laughed. ‘Not any more,’ he said. ‘From now on, your name is Perfect Cheerio Joe. That’s what you are, of course.’

Joe’s cholesterol-free, toasted-whole-grain eyes filled with joyful tears. He was perfect. 

‘Let’s go,’ Bob said. ‘I’m here to show you around the world. Let’s get a snack first. Donuts? Perfect Cheerio world is famous for them.’

‘Great,’ Perfect Cheerio Joe said. ‘So close to cannibalism, and yet still legal.’

They made their carbohydrate-laden way to a donut shop. But when they got inside, the cheerio behind the counter held up a hypothetical hand. ‘Whoa whoa whoa,’ he said. ‘You two have to go to the end of the line.’
	
Bob looked at the long line, stretching out the door and down the street. ‘Where’s the end of the line?’ he asked. 

The donut-seller scratched his hypothetical head. ‘Straight down the street for three blocks. Take a right, then go straight for four blocks. When you get to Fifth, take a left. That’s the end of the line.’

Joe’s hypothetical eyes widened. But no matter how long the lines in Perfect Cheerio world were, he was going to enjoy this day to the non-genetically-modified maximum. 

He and Bob followed the directions until they came to the end of the line. They waited in the line for twenty minutes. When they got to the front, they ordered their donuts, and Bob led Joe further into Perfect Cheerio world. 

‘Next let’s go to the biggest movie theater in the three worlds,’ Bob said. ‘It’s one of the biggest tourist attractions.’

They made their way to the theater. But at the tickets window, the ticket seller waved his low-saturated-fat hypothetical hand. ‘Whoa whoa whoa,’ he said. ‘You two have to go to the end of the line.’
	
Bob glanced at the long line, down the street. ‘Where’s the end of the line?’ he asked. 

The ticket-seller scratched his hypothetical head. ‘Straight down the street for three blocks. Take a right, then go straight for four blocks. When you get to Fifth, take a left. That’s the end of the line.’

‘Holy mother of cereal,’ Bob said.

But no matter how long the lines in Perfect Cheerio world were, Joe was going to enjoy this day to the non-genetically-modified maximum. 

He and Bob followed the directions until they came to the end of the line. They waited in the line for thirty minutes. When they got to the front they ordered tickets for a movie (a horror movie, ‘Tony’) and went into the theater lobby. 

‘Wait,’ said Joe. ‘We can’t watch a movie without popcorn!’ And so they made their way to the concessions counter. But at the counter, the concessions cheerio waved his 100% whole grain oats hypothetical hand. ‘Whoa whoa whoa, he said. ‘You two have to go to the end of the line.’
	
Bob glanced at the long line, which stretched out the door and down the street. ‘Where’s the end of the line?’ he asked. 

The concessions guy scratched his hypothetical head. ‘Straight down the street for three blocks. Take a right, then go straight for four blocks. When you get to Fifth, take a left. That’s the end of the line.’

‘In the name of the sacred three grams of soluble fiber…’ Joe started to say, before Bob cut him off. 
‘Language,’ he reminded Joe. ‘There are children present.’

But no matter how long the lines in Perfect Cheerio world were, Joe was going to enjoy this day to the non-genetically-modified maximum. 

He and Bob followed the directions until they came to the end of the line. They waited in the line for forty minutes. When they finally made their way back inside, they ordered popcorn, and went and saw the movie. (It was grrrrreat but rather disturbing.) 

After the movie ended, they walked outside. Bob began to lead Joe in one direction, but Joe stood gaping at the most massively terrifying rollercoaster he’d ever seen. ‘Is that… legal?’ he asked. 

‘Sure it is,’ Bob said. ‘Let’s go, if you feel up to it.’

They made their simply-made way to the amusement park. Joe started to walk toward the ride, but the operator waved his low-saturated-fat hypothetical hand. ‘Whoa whoa whoa,’ he said. ‘You two have to go to the end of the line.’
	
Bob glanced at the long line, which stretched around the park twice and then went back out the park gates. ‘Where’s the end of the line?’ he asked. 

The operator scratched his hypothetical head. ‘Straight down the street for three blocks. Take a right, then go straight for four blocks. When you get to Fifth, take a left. That’s the end of the line.’

‘Grown, milled, and toasted. Grown, milled, and toasted. Grown, milled, and toasted,’ Joe chanted to himself. ‘Don’t get a heart attack now. Besides being physically ironic, that would definitely ruin your first week in Perfect Cheerio world.’

He and Bob followed the directions until they came to the end of the line. They waited in the line for fifty minutes, until finally they arrived at the roller coaster, where they screamed their hypothetical lungs out for one and a half solid minutes. 

By the time they could walk straight, the sun had begun to go down. ‘I guess you should head home,’ Bob said. ‘But… wait! There’s one thing you haven’t done. It’s an oatstanding tradition for Perfect Cheerio World first-timers. Follow me.’

With that, he led the way down the street. ‘It’s the world famous Perfect Punch,’ he said. ‘Almost every fruit known to cheerio has been blended into one incredibly flavorful fruit punch. Believe me, this is worth any wait.’

They arrived at a brightly lit punch bar. Joe took a step inside, and looked around, amazed. 

Was it possible? Could it be real? 

Was the bar… really empty of other cheerios? No wait? No queue? 

Hardly daring to believe it, he approached the cheerio behind the counter. ‘Excuse me,’ he said, hesitantly. ‘But… where’s the line?’

The cheerio looked up and smiled. 

‘Oh,’ he said. ‘Don’t worry.

‘There is no punchline.’",The Infamous One About the Cheerio,12

Khrushchev then chimes in, ""Let's take the rails from behind the train and use them to lay the tracks in front"".
