Day of the convention comes. He goes, pumped, and can see the Pope in the distance talking to crowds of people. He decides that rather than approach him an introduce himself, he would see if he can get his attention with his nice outfit and maybe have the honor of being approached.

After waiting and walking around trying to make sure he notices him, no luck. Eventually, he actually sees the Pope approaching a scruffy homeless-looking man dressed in rags. At first he's surprised, but then thinks ""Of course... that makes sense, he must have a huge heart and compassion for the poor, plus he's probably used to constantly encountering men dressed like me"".

So he has an idea. He approaches the homeless scruffy guy and asks if they can temporarily switch clothes so that he can meet the Pope. The guy happily agrees, and they switch outfits.

The night of the reunion, he spotted her on the dance floor.  She was standing alone, obviously still shy, her hands over her mouth.  He walked over to her and said ""Mary, would you like to dance?""

Her eyes lit up.  She lowered her hands, and he could see she was more beautiful than ever, with only the faintest scar on her lip from the repair of her deformed mouth.  She smiled and replied ""Would I?  Would I?""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake.",762

The wife does her best to work solo, but no matter what, she is never really satisfied.      
  To correct this issue, the wife decides to see a specialist without her husband, as he does not seem to find the problem with their situation.  The doctor listens to the woman and proclaims, “Ha! I have just the thing...” as he walks to the back cabinet and grabs a pill bottle from the top shelf.   “These are extremely potent tablets.   You want to mix some of these with your husbands dinner.  Start slow, with maybe half a tablet.  I must stress that these are VERY potent.”   Well the wife is overjoyed with this prognosis and hurried home, anticipating the arrival of her husband for the evening.    
   When the husband gets home that evening, the wife does as the doctor suggested and breaks one of the pills in half and crushes it before mixing it in to her husbands mashed potatoes.  That evening, after their kids go to bed, the couple have their first sex in over a year.  The wife is ecstatic, but disappointed that it only lasts 5 minutes.   
   The next day, the wife decides to up the dose to 2 tablets, and that evening, the couple have wonderful sex, and the wife is satisfied.   
   This continues for a few weeks, with the wife keeping the consistent 2 pill dose, until one day when the wife had an extremely stressful day at work.  She gets home very frustrated and just wants something to distract her.   She decides to make her husband a smoothie when he gets home, but slips several extra pills in it.

He looked at the amount of people visiting everyday and came to the conclusion that the numbers were getting lower and lower. He had to do something about this and created a weird trick to get more visitors. Since he lived in a place where inflicting pain on people was completely normal he pulled a random person off the streets, then he would tie the person up and every visitor that buys something would get to inflict pain on the person.

So one day he decides to put a French person down and everytime someone buys something in the restaurant, they would be able to kick him once. Suddenly a lot of people would go to the restaurant just because the fact they like to hurt others. The line to kick the person was actually pretty long He would get a total of 1000 visitors a day, which also meant that the French person got around 1000 kicks that day. The restaurant owner saw this and was happy that his plan was working.

People come from all over to buy his fruit. 

The guy on the hill is a crotchety old man who hates the guy in the valley, primarily because his thriving fruit stand brings so much traffic by his house, stirring up dust on the old dirt road, and heaven forbid you happen to be driving one way as someone else is coming the other way as it's a narrow road with steep roadside ditches carrying water down the mountain, the very same constant flow of fresh water that allows the valley guy's fruit and berries to thrive.

The guy on the mountain frequently calls the valley guy to complain and has even taken to using binoculars to see what he's up to, just so he always has a steady stream of things to complain about.

The valley guy is understandably annoyed by the frequent phone calls and harassment, but he won't be deterred from his thriving fruit stand. In fact, he schemes to further his business by adding a new product: juice! He invests in some juicing and bottling equipment and begins advertising his new venture. 100% all-natural farm fresh organic juices with no added sugar!

Valley guy runs into a bit of a snag as his first attempts at juicing don't go so well. All of his fruit juices are surprisingly bland. Not wanting to add sugar, valley guy thought maybe he'd mix the fruit juices up so the various fruit flavors would work together in harmony and bring out the flavor, but still no luck. 

Valley guy then remembers that his mother used to make iced tea when he was growing up, and she always left jars of her tea out in the sun and would tell him it improved the flavor.

Valley guy thought maybe if he left his jars of mixed fruit juices out in the sun they could improve, but because his home was surrounded by the fruit trees, berry bushes, and vines, there was really only one way to sun his jars of juice: his clothesline.

Meanwhile, the guy up on the mountain has his binoculars out and he's looking down at his valley neighbor hanging his jars of fruit juice like clothes out to dry and can't take it any longer. He calls up his valley neighbor who picks up the phone. Valley guys says, ""Alright, alright. What is it this time?""

Being the great treasure hunter he is, he flew out the Egypt to uncover the riches.

When he landed, he met up with the local guide he hired to give him a run of the land. 

Guide: *Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! World’s greatest adventurer Indiana Jones! Heed my* *warning, these pyramids are some of the most dangerous structures in the world! They are nothing like you* *have ever seen before! There’s booby traps, venomous snakes and spiders, intense mazes, deep abysses, and* *tons of other grave-robbers who aren’t afraid to kill you to get to the treasure! Please proceed with caution!*

Indiana scoffed at him and exclaimed: *I AM INDIANA JONES, the world’s greatest adventurer! I fear no* *challenge* *in front of me!*

His guide frantically warned him: *Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! World’s greatest adventurer* *Indiana Jones! These pyramids increase in difficulty as you go on! You will have to take ALL the necessary* *supplies with you to survive.*

Indiana proclaims: *I AM INDIANA JONES, the world’s greatest adventurer, all I need is my trusty bull whip, and* *this one road flare for when things get hairy.*

The guide gets stern: *Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! World’s greatest adventurer Indiana Jones!* *Do as you must but please trust me on this, you will know when to use this when the time comes, but please* *take this Robitussin with you.*

Indiana Jones was confused. He’s the world’s greatest adventurer, he’s not going to catch a cold. But he hired his guide for a reason, so he trusts his word and reluctantly takes it, and stores it in his satchel, and runs into the first pyramid.

This pyramid is just as his guide described, covered in booby traps and tons of grave robbers. It takes him nearly an hour to work his way through the maze until he finally reached the final room before the tomb chamber. The tiny room is packed with grave robbers trying to get in, he starts throwing elbows and shoving his way to the back of the room. He makes his way up to the door leading to the chamber. It’s locked by a puzzle containing hieroglyphs on a grid, he thinks about it for a second and solves the puzzle. He pushes open the door and the light exposes a the treasure room, only for him to see that its empty. All the treasure has already been looted.
He storms out of the pyramid angry, walks up to his guide and shouts: *It’s empty!! The treasure was all gone! I’m going on the next pyramid!*

His guide warns him: * Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! World’s greatest adventurer Indiana Jones!* *Heed my warning! The second pyramid is twice as dangerous as the first! It is far riskier to go in!*

Indiana proclaims: *I AM INDIANA JONES, the world’s greatest adventurer! I fear no challenge!* and he runs into the second pyramid.

His guide was right once again, this pyramid had twice as many booby traps, far less grave robbers, and took him twice as long to get through. After about 2 hours of running through the maze, and coming close to death several times, he makes his way to the final room before the tomb chamber. The room was pitch black and all he could hear was a loud hissing noise. Fearing the worst, he lights his road flare to see a floor covered in snakes from wall to wall. He mutters to himself: *Ugh snakes. Why’d it HAVE to be snakes*. He tosses the flare into the center of the room and the snakes scatter to the walls and crawl into each crack. Relieved, he walks up to the door, where he is once again presented with a similar puzzle. He thinks about it a little longer but eventually solves it, opens the door, and once again finds an empty room.

He is furious now! He runs up to his guide and yells: *That one was empty too! This is ridiculous! I’m going to* *the 3rd pyramid!*

His guide panics: * Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! Indiana Jones! World’s greatest adventurer Indiana Jones!* *Please listen to me! This third pyramid is the most dangerous place on Earth!!! No one has EVER come out* *alive!Please do not go in if you value your life*

Indiana, still furious but overcome with adrenaline proclaims: *I AM INDIANA JONES, THE WORLD'S GREATEST* *ADVENTURER! I fear no challenge! There is nothing that can keep me from that treasure!*

His guide tries to stop him but Indiana runs past him and into the final pyramid. There is not another person in the entire pyramid. There are four times as many booby traps and he almost died 20+ times. It takes him almost half a day to get through the pyramid. By the time he reaches the final room he is exhausted. He grabs the lit torch in the middle of the room and starts walking to the final door. He notices there’s several large sarcophaguses lining the walls. Suddenly one of them starts to shake and out bursts a mummy that starts chasing him. Indiana bolts down a hallway, making sharp turns, going left, going right but he can’t seem to lose this mummy. He comes up to a deep abyss with no bottom in sight. He pulls out his bull whip and latches it onto a branch hanging over the gap and swings across. As he lands on the other side the whip slips out of his hands and fall into the abyss, but the mummy is stuck on the other side and he is safe.

He finds his way back to the room and grabs the torch he dropped and starts to walk towards the chamber door. All of sudden the mummy’s sarcophagus comes alive and starts chasing him as well!!! He doesn’t know what to but bolts down another hallway as the coffin chases him. 

He’s worn out and the sarcophagus is gaining on him, he doesn’t know what to do, he lost his flare and his whip. But in a stroke of brilliance, remembers the Robitussin.

He reaches into his bag

He grabs it

He throws it

and the Robitussin stops the coffin

Like every saturday he makes his way down to the lake. He throws in his fishing pole and after a short while, a rather large fish starts pulling the string. The man pulls it out and low and behold, it's one of the biggest fish he's ever caught. As he's about to put it into his cooler box, satisfied with his catch and the couple of days where he will be able to feed himself, the fish starts talking to him. He says: ""Wait! Don't kill me for I am a magical fish! If you let me back in the water, I will fullfill three wishes that you may have, whatever they may be!"" Baffled by his discovery, the man starts thinking to himself. Even though this fish is quite amazing he still needs food for himself, but decides to give the fish a chance. He says: ""Alright then, I wish that when I return home, a giant mansion will be where my shack once stood!"" ""It's done"", says the fish with a nod. ""Second, I wish that inside of the house, the 200 most beautiful women I could imagine will be waiting for me. And third, these women's sole purpose shall be satisfying my every need!"". Once again the fish nods and says: ""All your wishes will be granted as soon as I touch the water again!"". The man, still hesitant, throws the fish back into the water and makes his way home. As he turns the corner to his street, indeed there's a gigantic mansion standing where his shack stood in the morning. Excited he enters the house and indeed, the 200 most beautiful women he could imagine are waiting for him and immediately start walking towards him and undressing him! 

After about two weeks of enjoying his mansion and having every wish read from his lips, the man thinks to himself, that he should go thank the fish for giving him all he's ever dreamed of. So once again he makes his way down to the lake and calls out for the fish. A few moments pass and there, the fish pokes his head out of the water. The man says: ""Magical fish! You've given me all and more I've ever dreamed of! If there is anything I can do for you, I want to grant you one wish aswell and shall try to fullfill it to the best of my abilities!"" The fish blushes and hesitantly says: ""Well if you would offer me anything, there is indeed one thing I've missed as a magical thing. It's been forever since I've experienced a nice assfucking!"" The man is pretty grossed out by the thought of mounting this fish from behind but after a bit of thinking he comes to the conclusion that this one time is worth the millions of times he can have sex with the most beautiful women imaginable so he agrees.

As he mounts the fish and starts gently penetrating his anus, the fish suddenly turns into an 8 year old girl...

One day, Pete complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor."" 

His friend said, ""Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.

Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about and it will only cost you $10.00."" 

Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. 

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read: 

1. You have tennis elbow. 
2. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. 
3. It will be better in two weeks....... 

That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. 

He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 

He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed its alights, and printed out the following analysis: 

1. Your tap water is too hard. 
2. Get a water softener. 
3. Your dog has ringworm. 
4. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 
5. Your daughter is using cocaine. 
6. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. 
7. Your wife is pregnant ....... twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

1. There's a long segment in this symphony where the bass violins don't have a thing to do. Not a single note for page after page.

2. There used to be a tavern called Dez's 400, right across the street from the Seattle Opera House, rather favored by local musicians.


It had been decided that during this performance, after the bass players had played their parts in the opening of the Ninth, they were to quietly lay down their instruments and leave the stage rather than sit on their stools looking and feeling dumb for twenty minutes.

Once they got backstage, someone suggested that they trot across the street and quaff a few brews. After they had downed the first couple rounds, one said, ""Shouldn't we be getting back? It'd be awfully embarrassing if we were late.""

Another, presumably the one who suggested this excursion in the first place, replied, ""Oh, I anticipated we could use a little more time, so I tied a string around the last pages of the conductor's score. When he gets down to there, Milton's going to have to slow the tempo way down while he waves the baton with one hand and fumbles with the string with the other.""

So they had another round and finally returned to the Opera House, a little tipsy by now. However, as they came back on stage, one look at their conductor's face told them they were in serious trouble. Katims was furious! And why not? After all...

It was the bottom of the Ninth, the score was tied, and the basses were loaded.","A number of years ago, the Seattle Symphony was doing Beethoven's Ninth under the baton of Milton Katims.",69

After 2 weeks they're both pros. One day they're jamming out and their friend Cow comes over. They suggest they make a band and Cow play the bass. So Cow calls the lessons place and they tell him the same thing, 2 weeks.

They start practicing and playing at local events and get really good. One day when they're playing at a pub, an agent watches them and approaches them after their performance. He tells them they're really good and offers them to go on a nationwide tour.

Fast forward a year and they are on world tour. As they're about to get onto the plane for their last destination, Horse gets a call from his home town. It's his mom. She's sick and they don't really know whats up with her. So he flies home and is going to meet back up with the band since their performance is in a couple days. When he gets to the hospital his mom just ends up having a bad cold. He gets another call. This time from his agent, he tells Horse that there was a terrible accident and that the plane crashed with all his band mates on it. There were no survivors. 

Obviously Horse is traumatized by this and didnt want to feel that pain. So Horse walks into a bar, and the bartender asks, ""Why the long face?""",so there was a horse,14

That night, while everyone sleeps, the little cornflake jumps out the bowl, along the table, down the leg, across the floor, up the drawers, onto the counter and into the toaster. He turns on the toaster and feels himself getting browner. Ahhhhh...
The little cornflake decides he's had enough, jumps from the toaster, along the  counter, down the drawers, across the floor, up the leg, across the table into the box of cornflakes.
The man comes down the next morning, pours his cornflakes, pours his milk and begins to eat. The little cornflake is still in the box. He knows what's happened, he hasn't browned himself enough.
So he waits until the night, when everyone is sleeping and jumps out of the box, along the table, down the leg, across the floor, up the drawers, onto the counter and into the toaster. He turns on the toaster and makes sure to brown both sides evenly. Ahhhhhhhhh....
 Then he jumps out of the toaster, across the counter, down the drawers, along the floor, up the leg, across the table and back into the box of cornflakes.
The next morning the man comes down the stairs and pours his bowl of cornflakes, and his milk into the bowl.
The little cornflake isn't in the bowl. Now he's angry, that's it, tomorrow will be his day or else.
Late that night when everyone was sleeping the little cornflake jumps out of the box, along the table, down the leg, across the floor, up the drawers, along the counter and into the toaster. He turns it on and lies in it for a few minutes. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Now he's perfect. He jumps from the toaster, runs along the  counter, down the drawers, across the floor, up the leg, across the table and, finally, into the box of cornflakes.
The next morning the man comes down the stairs, sits down and pours his bowl of cornflakes. And he's in. The little cornflake is in the bowl and he feels great, he sees the milk and watches as its poured. It feels wonderful, it soothing and calming and beautifully cool. He floats for a while, enjoying himself, and then, he's on the spoon. He's in the spoon and about to be eaten, he's heading towards the mouth, the man looks down at the spoon as it comes closer, he sees the little cornflake, and he says....

So years and years of Johnny avoiding women went by until one day, he was with a nice girl that he'd known for a while, and his urges were getting the best of him.

They went back to her place and things were starting to heat up.

""What's the matter Johnny? Have you never been with a woman before?"" She asked.

""No,"" Johnny said shyly. ""My mom told me there were teeth in there and they would bite me if I got too close and I've just never had the courage.""

""Well, that's a load of bullshit,"" she said.  ""How about this?  I'll take my panties off and let you take a look to make sure it's safe.  How about that?""

""You'd do that for me?"", Johnny asked.

So as promised, she exposed herself and let Johnny poke around down there for a good while.

When Johnny finally surfaced he had a quizzical, if not disgusted look on his face.

And whose given name was 'Onestone'.
He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.
After years and years of torment,
Onestone finally cracked and said,'
If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'
The word got around and nobody called him that any more.
Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said,
'Good morning, Onestone..'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.
He made love to her all the next day,
Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.
The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.
Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until
A woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.
Yellow Bird , who was BlueBird's cousin,
Was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.
She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,
Then he made love to her all day,
Made love to her all night,
Made love to her all the next day,
Made love to her all the next night, but YellowBird wouldn't die!

After a few days of getting acquainted with his co-workers at the office, he's invited out to the bar for a few drinks. When they walk in, they all start to smirk and grin to each other as they nod their attention to the girl at the table in the corner. John notices but doesn't say anything, unsure what to make of the obvious inside scoop.

They grab a few seats at the bar and start talking and slamming back a few cold ones. After a few laughs John asks his new friends about the girl they saw.

His co-workers nudge each other as they all chuckle. ""Oh man... Her? Yeah rumor has it she's got the voice of an angel and gives amazing head.""

John replies, ""Ok... Is that it?""

Co-worker, ""Get this, she can go down on you and sing at the same time. No gargle or nothing.""

John, ""Whaaaat? No way.""

Co-worker, ""Yup.""

John, ""Oh I gotta see this... Check this out"".

John walks over to the table, starts striking up a conversation with her and after a bit flashes the thumbs up to his buddies as he walks out the door with her. They head back to his new, freshly furnished apartment and carry on flirting. Finally, John gets the courage to bring up the rumor. 

She just smiles and tells him to lay back as she walks over to shut off the lights. John hears her walk back over and crouch down between his legs. *Unzip* as she pulls his pants down and starts pleasing him. Moments later, she starts singing in a beautiful, smoky, sultry voice. 

John, ""Oh. My. God. This is amazing.""

He releases and passes out on the couch.

John wakes up the next morning and as his vision settles, he looks around and notices his wallet, keys, TV, Xbox, computer... All of his valuables are gone. She cleaned him out. Then he notices on the coffee table, with a look of sudden realization,
