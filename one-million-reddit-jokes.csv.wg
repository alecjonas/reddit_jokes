post,34rezt,2qh72,jokes,false,1430692124,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/34rezt/plastic_parrots/,self.jokes,,"A father is talking to his three year old son the week before his birthday. He asks him what he would like as a present, and the boy replies that he would like a parrot. His dad replies that he can't have a real parrot, but searches all around and eventually finds a plastic parrot toy. The boy's mother assures him that it will all be ok and they sit down with their son to open his presents. The father worriedly hands the plastic parrot to his son but the boy immediately loves his gift and will not stop playing with it. That Christmas, the boy asks for another plastic parrot to play with, so his dad goes back to the store and gets another. The boy is overjoyed and can't stop playing with his parrots. The next year he asks again for a plastic parrot, and his dad is surprised that he is still so interested in parrots, but complies. He begins to amass more and more toy parrots. On his sixth birthday his parents throw him a parrot themed party. By this point he has started school and some of the kids in his class come to the party.
'Your kid really does like parrots' some of the parents note when they are dropping their children off at the party.
The boy's parents shrug it off, thinking it is just a phase. But year after year, the boy keeps asking for plastic parrots for his birthday, and his entire room is full of them, along with the parrot themed wallpaper and duvet cover. By his eighth birthday he has around 30 plastic parrots, this later rises to 50 by the time he is 10. He is finding it increasingly hard to make friends at school, preferring to stay home and play with his parrots instead of hanging out with humans. At the age of 13 his parents take him to a psychiatrist to ask if there is anything wrong, but he is completely normal. He goes to another psychiatrist, but is told the same.
'He just really likes parrots'.
By the age of 14 the situation is starting to take its toll on the family. The house becomes filled with plastic parrots and his mother cannot handle it anymore. She gets into arguments with the father and eventually walks out on him and the boy. This event makes parrot boy even more depressed and so by his 15th birthday, even though his parents no longer give him plastic parrots directly, he spends all his birthday money on parrots. 
By this point the dad is furious. He asks his son, 'Why are you so obsessed with these plastic parrots?' but his son simply blanks him and walks away. Every time he brings it up in conversation, he changes the subject.
When the boy turns 16 his dad tells him he needs to get a job, because he cannot keep giving him money for plastic parrots. He becomes a waiter in a local restaurant, and things start to look up.
He is actually leaving his bedroom to socialise rather than play with parrots, he even meets a girl at work and eventually she becomes his girlfriend. He gives some of his plastic parrots to a charity that gives toys to disadvantaged children.
But things come crashing down when him and his girlfriend split up. Just one time, he asks her to dress up as a parrot for him and she doesn't comply, storming out of the house calling him a freak. This makes his plastic parrot addiction worse, he buys more and more, begins hoarding them, hiding them from his dad. But one day his dad finds a bunch under the bed.
Instead of screaming at the son, his dad breaks down and cries.
'Is there anything I can do to make it stop? Is there anything in the world you want more than plastic parrots?' the dad begs with his son.
'Well, there is one thing,' he replies. 'I still can't drive, and I would really like a car.'
The dad runs off, booking his son a driving instructor immediately. After a few months of lessons the boy is really getting the hang of driving. His dad is so proud. The plastic parrots have once again been sold off or given away and it seems the son is cured. He takes his driving test and passes the first time. He is so pleased and his dad so proud of him that he takes him to a garage and asks him to pick out a car. Whichever car, no matter how expensive, if it will stop the parrots. The boy is not too fussy, he is happy with a ford focus. The next day he drives off in his new car, but his dad receives a phone call. His son has been in an accident and crashed. He rushes to the hospital but it soon becomes clear that his son has been badly hurt.
'His injuries are serious but he is stable, and he will probably pull through,' his dad is told.
His dad runs into the room to speak with his son, terrified after what has happened.
'Son, I love you so much. But please tell me, just incase anything like this ever happens again, but worse. The only thing I want to ask you and have ever wanted to ask you in my entire life, is why are you so obsessed with the parrots?'
He looks at his son, who starts to cry.
'Dad I love you. And I am so sorry I kept it from you,' his son replies. He knows that it is time for the truth. 'The real reason that I'm so obsessed with plastic parrots is'..........











 and then he died.

As to your letter you requested more information about the accident that happened on the work site. I would firstly like to clear that I'm about 75kg. Answer to your letters article 11 I was working on the work site alone that day. I, by profession build roofs on buildings and on that it was a 7 floor building. When I finished my work I had about 275kg of roof buildings materials over. Of course the building didn't have an elevator and I didn't want to carry it all down by the stairs. We had a small crane with a roll attached to the building so I thought I'll just get them down via crane. I went upstairs and loaded the lifting bay attached to the crane. The wire was firmly attached to the ground. So I went downstairs and released the wire, but like I answered to you before my weight at the time was about 75kg. So when I released the wire I was shocked when the ground was disappearing from under my feet. I was so shocked that I didn't release to let go of the wire. About on the third floor up I met with the loading bay loaded with excess materials. No need to tell you that this is where I got the fracture to the scull and injury to the shoulder. Because I got my reaction back and didn't want to fall from high I kept holding on until the crane roll jammed my fingers between the wire. At the same time the loading bay hit the ground and all the materials came off it and were scattered all around. The loading bay was just about 25kg without the building materials so I was coming down. That is where I got my leg broken and all the wounds on my legs while meeting the loading bay about on the third floor down again. Luckily it slowed me down enough, so when I landed on the building materials I only broke three of my spinal cords. Then I let go of the wire and the last thing I remember is the loading bay coming down towards me.

Sincerely

John Smith

I think my Mom is out of town so he has a lot of time to himself to write updates about the dog watching...

He wrote this update for my uncle and aunt:

Susan and Larry,

Just a quick note to say Dolly and Kent are having a good time. We’ve really enjoyed these last few days 
and have really bonded. We found out we both like snacks and drinks after a hard day, watching old UFC 
fights and staying up late watching animal planet. Dolly really likes the animal ghost stories, but Kent 
doesn’t think she really believes all of them.  Our favorite game is called “Where’s Larry? Kent goes first. 

He asks Dolly ‘Where’s Larry?”  “Where’s Larry? “, Dolly will just look at Kent, like he’s speaking French 
or something. But, when Kent says’s ‘Where’s Susan? “Where’s Susan?” Dolly will tilt her head and then  
run over to the door where you last went out. She stares at the door for a few seconds and then turns 
back to look at Kent, with a slightly annoyed and somewhat sad expression. Like she’s thinking, “I won’t 
fall for that one again”, but she does.   We also have invented a few other games, Like “Where’s the 
giant cat hiding?”, “Who cut the cheese?” “Find your Food” and” Who’s in charge?” But our favorite is 
still ‘Where’s Larry?” We have learned that Kent needs to remind Dolly, that after she goes number two, 
it is not ok to use the new bedroom carpet to clean one’s self. Kent asks himself what Mark would do? 
But then, Kent gives Dolly some more water, and Kent has another Jack and coke until he passes out. 

Dolly is also learning personal boundaries, like, don’t always follow Kent into the bathroom and when 
the door is closed, she doesn’t always have to sit at rapt attention waiting at the door.  Kent can tell,  
that Dolly thinks Kent may disappear, like you guys did and not come back.  Kent  shows photos of  both 
of you to Dolly, so she won’t forget what you look like, except she still confuses Larry’s photo with  
pictures of other  relative’s and magazine photos. 

One time , when I said, “Find Larry’? she put her paw on a photo of Dick Cheney. Kent believes Dolly just has a strange sense of humor, or is just messing with him. We are both collaborating on writing a  script for a movie, called “The last  Lhasa Apso that didn’t listen ” it’s going pretty well, except now, Dolly doesn’t like the title . Well, we have to run. No, literally we have to run, Kent tried to tell Dolly, not to mix milk bones with mix nuts, but again,  she  wouldn’t listen.

Sincerely, Dolly and Kent.",My Dad Is Dog Watching My Uncles Dog For The Week...,1

post,34orqb,2qh72,jokes,false,1430624435,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/34orqb/the_elephant/,self.jokes,,"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University .


On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.


The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.


Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.


Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.


Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant",The Elephant,8

The man perks up. So, the doctor says, ""You must decide how many inches you want. But understand that you have been married for over thirty years and this is something you should discuss with your wife. If you had a five incher before and get a nine incher now she might be a bit put out. If you had a nine incher before and you decide to only invest in a five incher now, she might be disappointed.

The man agrees to talk it over with his wife.

The doctor comes back the next day, ""So, have you spoken with your wife?"" ""Yes I have,"" says the man.

Suddenly the light bulb burns out over their head and maintenance guy comes and changes the light bulb. While changing it, he hands the burnt out light bulb over to the mathematician who puts it carefully on the desk. After the maintenance guy leaves he says looking at the burned out light bulb: ""You do know guys that if you put a light bulb in your mouth so that socket is outwards you are not capable getting it out."" Physicians disagree and say: ""If it goes in, it also can come out. It is common sense.""

One of the physicians puts then the burned out light bulb in the mouth socket outwards and after that he can't get it out (proved scientific fact now). So they order a taxi and go to the hospital.

Taxi driver is of course looking at guy with the WTF face but takes them too the hospital. Reception nurse of course tries not to laugh after hearing the story from the two guys who could speak and she pointed to the surgeons room.


Surgeon listened the story and is pleasant and experienced, so he just presses three nerves on the neck so the mouth opens up even wider and he gets the bulb out. Doctor says that his jaw movement will be back in 40 min, until then his jaw will be wide open and laughs at the three idiots who put light bulbs in their mouth in the middle of the night.

Guys take their bulb and get back to the taxi. The driver asked what it was all about. They explain but the taxi driver didn't believe them, the mathematician even takes out the light bulb. Next thing they were driving back to the hospital with the taxi driver having a light bulb in his mouth and socket hanging out. Reception nurse was literally rolling on the floor and laughing.

Doctor removes the light bulb from the driver mouth and crushes it and says: ""Otherwise you idiots will be coming here all night!""

Because the taxi driver also had paralyzed jaw and jaw wide open, he couldn't drive properly and the police pulled them over. Police then asked the driver that where the hell are you driving these three.

Since the driver could not talk the mathematician explained what had happened. Police of course didn't believe them and asked them to follow him and went to check from the police station their background and check out the story. Few minutes later the police enters the taxi and with a light bulb in his mouth, socket hanging out and waving like hell to go the hospital.

As they pull up and go to the reception nurse, there was hard time reviving her after that. So they go straight to the surgeons door and knock.

Surgeon opens the door, jaw wide open.

The two men look at each other then agree to accept the bet. So the drunk walks to the window and jumps out.

""Well, you see."" the drunk replies. ""There is this ventilation shaft straight below this window, and the stream of air is so strong, it slows you down enough to land safely on the grid. Why don't you try it yourselves?"" 

So, both the men hurry to the window and jump out, facing certain death as they hit the street at high speed.

 So, he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA (Cheerio DNA) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. However, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt.

 Anyway. He does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. So, she does it. The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. She then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. He does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. So he says out loud, ""Okay, this is really the last time. If she changes again, I will just stay back with my family."" So he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. So, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). Anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. 

Finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes.

 Finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch line.","So, as everyone knows, two different species (flavors) of cheerios cannot mate, right?",0

His car breaks down about 100 yards away from the mechanic's shop. So what else is a penguin to do? He manages to push his car all the way to the shop, inch by inch. By the time he gets there, he is about to melt into a puddle on the ground, panting, sweating, barely coherent. The mechanic comes out to see the penguin and take a look at the car.
""Not to worry!"" The mechanic says. ""We can get this fixed up for you right quick. There's an ice cream shop just across the street if you want to wait there and cool off.""

So the penguin waddles over to the ice cream shop, and orders an outlandishly large dish of ice cream. Now we musn't forget, penguins don't have fingers, so a spoon would be an impossibility. He however, did not let this minor setback stop him (I mean come on, he can *drive* after all), and just went apeshit on this bowl of ice cream. By the time he was done, he was thoroughly chilled, and thoroughly covered in melted ice cream. He figured enough time had passed, and he headed over to the mechanic's shop to see if his car was done. 

""Hey Mr. mechanic, what's the damage?""

His parents watched from the doorway, waving, and smiling as there son disappeared into this distance.  

On his way he meets up with his friends and they all begin talking.  He looks over and sees a purple butterfly flying around for a moment, before disappearing behind some bushes.  The bell rings and he runs inside.

""How are you Timmy?"" Lucy asks him.

""Good,"" he grins.  ""Have you ever seen a Purple Butterfly before?"" 

""Don't say that..."" Lucy stares at him in disbelief.

""What's wrong? Why can't I say Purple Butterfly?"" Timmy replies, though his tone is a bit louder in his confusion.  The class hears this time.  

""Mrs. Smith! Mrs. Smith!"" another classmate yells.  ""You won't believe what Timmy said!""

""Now, now class...calm down,"" Mrs. Smith insists.  ""Timmy, what is everyone so upset about?  What did you say?""

""All I said was I saw purple butterflies!"" Timmy exclaims, his face flush with distress.

""Timmy!"" she screams.  ""Get to the principals office right now!"" She stands there, face bright red pointing at the door.  Timmy walks slowly out the door with his head down.  

He reaches the principals office and sits down in the waiting area.  Another teacher stops by, and Timmy just stares at the floor, embarrassed about how he ended up here.  

""Timmy?"" the teacher exclaims in confusion.  ""How did you end up down here?  You never get in trouble."" 

""I just was talking and mentioned purple butterflies and I...""

Without saying anything the teacher grabs Timmy by the ear and drags him into the principals office.

""You won't believe what this kid just said!"" the teacher screams before leaving the room and slamming the door.

""What did you say Timmy?"" the principal says in a soft tone.

""I'd rather not say,"" Timmy says, sensing a pattern. 

""Nonsense"" the principal replies.  ""As long as you are honest I will not punish you any more than I have to.  You are safe to tell me the truth.""

Timmy sighs, ""All I said was purple butterflies.  I don-""

""GET OUT!"" the principal yells, pointing at the door.  ""Walk home.  I'm not even calling your parents!  This is such a disgrace!  I can't believe you would mention that!""

Timmy begins to cry and runs from the office, leaving the school and begins running home.  He runs and runs and runs until he reaches his door.  His mother is outside and sees him coming.  She bends down and opens her arms.  He runs into them.

""What's wrong?"" she asks with so much concern.

""I was at school, and I saw a butterfly, and I told everyone that I saw it...and they all told me it was terrible and I shouldn't say it"" he explains.

""What?"" Timmy's mother says in confusion.  ""Why would that matter?""

""I don't know""  Timmy explains.  ""It was a purple butterfly.""

""Timmy go to your room right now!"" she screams.  ""Just wait until your father gets home. I'm calling him right now!""

Timmy waits patiently in his room.  His mom is on the phone hysterically crying.  ""You won't believe what your son said to me....I don't know what we are going to do...come home right now please!""

Silence fills the air.  Timmy lays on his bed staring at the ceiling.  Then the garage door opens and he knows that his father his home.  He hears the clunking of his fathers footsteps on the stairs and begins to feel tense.

""Son, why are you home from school?"" he asks, a soft tone fills the air.  Timmy feels a bit calmer.

""I keep telling people what I said, and just telling them gets me in trouble.  I don't know what is so bad about it!"" Timmy says with tears filling his eyes.

""What did you say?"" Timmy's dad asks.

""I don't want to say.""

You can tell me, not punishment for telling me.""

""That I saw a purple butterfly.""

His fathers face goes red, and a scowl comes across his face.  He grabs a backpack and puts a handful of clothes in it.

""Your gone,"" his father screams.  ""We can't have you living hear anymore.""

Timmy grabs the backpack and starts running again.  He decides to go to his grandmothers house because she's always been so good to him.  She always made him feel special and had never once got mad at him.

After about an hour of walking he manages to get there.  He knocks on the door and tries to fake a smile.  He hears the shuffling of her feet and the click of the lock.  She opens it and greets him with a hug.

""What are you doing here during school, Timmy?""  she says with a mild look of confusion on her face.

""I just got kicked out of home..."" Timmy says sadly, staring at the floor.

""Well what did you do?""

""I just said something I shouldn't have.  I don't even know what it means.""

""What was it Timmy? You can tell me about it and then we'll get you a cookie.  You can stay here until your parents get a bit calmer.""

""I'd rather not say,"" Timmy says.

""Cookie first then,"" Grandma answers.

Timmy takes a bite of his cookie and feels safe.  His grandma smiles from across the table. 

""Now what was it Timmy?""  she asks.

""I just said I didn't know what purple butterflies were.""

""OUT!"" she yells.

Timmy knew the drill and ran out in tears again.

He stumbles around for awhile trying to find a place to sit.  He ends up downtown and sees a homeless man.  *maybe he will tell me!* Timmy thinks.

""Can you help me?"" Timmy asks as he approaches the homeless man.

""Sure kid,"" he says in a gruff tone.

""What does purple butterfly mean?""

""Don't want to ask that kid.  Get out of here before I beat your face myself!""

""Thank you anyways,"" Timmy sighs and walks away.

He gets further downtown and sees that the sun is setting.  He cries to himself now because the streets are beginning to empty a bit.  He watches a police car drive by.  Then it drives by again a few minutes later.  Then again later, but this time it stops.  

""You okay kid?"" the officer says as he approaches.  

""I have nowhere to go,"" Timmy says.  ""I got kicked out.""

""Slow down, whats your name?"" the officer asks.

""Timmy.""

""Now Timmy, what happened? You got kicked out?""

""Yes sir.  I got kicked out of school, my parents, and my grandmas.""

""Did you do something?""

""I just said something.""

""What did you say?"" the cop asks.

""I'd rather not say, it only gets me in trouble.""

""We will need to know.  You won't get in trouble, it will just help our investigation.""

""I just said I saw a purple butterfly!"" Timmy cries.

""Oh.."" the cop says.  He takes out his handcuffs.  

Timmy begins running.  He sees an alleyway on the other side of the street.  The officer grabs his arm, but he manages to yank it away.  He leaps off the curb and at that moment a truck smashes into him.

One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.

The little boy says, ""It's dark in here.""
The man whispers, ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball.""
Man - ""That's nice.""
Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$250.""

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet together.

Boy - ""It's dark in here.""
Man - ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball glove.""
Man - Remembering last time, asks, ""How much?""
Boy - ""$750.""
Man - ""Fine.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball.""

The boy says, ""I can't. I sold them.""

The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""

The son says ""$1,000.""

The father says, ""It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.""

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

The boy says, ""It's dark in here.""
The priest says, ""Don't start that shit again!""",It's dark in here.,463

It was, at first, ignored as noise, but eventually, after being listened to many times, the recording made it clear what he said.

But for years, Armstrong would stay mum whenever he was asked about it.

Until about 10 years later, when someone asked him about it after he had a speech at Purdue University.

— Well, I have been refraining talking about it until now, but now that I learned that Mrs Bernstein passed away, 5 years after her husband, I feel I can tell it now.

You see, when I was a kid, I was playing ball in the backyard, and suddenly, the ball went to the neighbour’s yard. Since mr Bernstein was not fond of kids trampling his manicured lawn and very eager to tell them to get off it, I simply tiptoed very quietly to retrieve the ball that fell under his bedroom window.

You know, back then, there was no air-conditionning, and this being during the dog days of summer, the windows were kept open as much as possible to try to keep the temperature down inside the house.

So, as I got near the bedroom window, I crawled on all fours to reach the ball when I heard Mrs Bernstein loudly shout to her husband “Oral sex you want? Oral sex? Well, you will get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon”!!!!","“It’s a small step for [a] man, and a giant leap for mankind” (Good luck, mr Bernstein).",0

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the 
dinner.
However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited: Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour!

“I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I 
heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The 
very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from 
his employer; had an affair with his boss’s wife; had sex with his 
boss’s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.

I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.”

Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of 
apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:

“I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,” said the 
politician. “In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.”

He replied.""Simple, I will just show her penis and ask her what it is and if she answers right must mean she is well versed in matters of sex and hence not an innocent virgin!""

And so in his quest he dated a number of gals but all failed his tests.

Then one day at a supermarket checkout lane he saw this angelic looking beautiful girl and instantly fell in love with her and wanted to marry her but then reminded himself about the test. He somehow befriended the gal and dated her for a few times and one day he brought her home where both of them sat on the couch.

The girl giggled a lot like a young teen and replied.""thats a tadpole!""

The man was surprised at the reply and asked.""are you sure this is a tadpole""

The giggled more and said.""yes i am sure this is a tadpole""

The man was happy to hear that and came to conclusion this girl had to be an innocent virgin and immediately asked to marry her and she agreed.

After marriage it was the first time they both were in bed and so he undressed himself naked and told her,""Darling tonight I am going into initiate you into the beautiful world of sex and teach you all I know and to star with this thing you see here is called a penis""

Key Fact 1) We have a decorative novelty shower-curtain. It's white with a streaked, bloody hand-print, ala Psycho.

Key Fact 2) If you're standing in the right spot at the right time of night, you can hear the neighbors fighting through the vent in the bathroom floor.

Well, tonight the neighbors were fighting rather loudly, and it sounded like it was getting physical, so I called the cops. We live on the second story, so I told the dispatcher to send them to the laundromat on the corner, and I'd meet them down there.

So I throw on my jacket and head down to the corner. About fifteen minutes later, two cops pull up and greet me. I explain the situation: I can hear the neighbors fighting, and it sounds like it might have gotten violent, but I don't know where these people are relative to us. Would the officers like to come up and give it a listen, from within our bathroom?

You can guess where this is going.

They agreed. So we walked down the street, and up our front stoop, and I unlock the front door, and we tromp up the stairs toward the apartment. I warn them, ""Watch your step, we've got two cats,"" because that's the only thing that springs to mind as being worthy of a warning.

I open the door, and both cops come in. One hangs out near the entrance, while the other follows me into the bathroom.

I flick the lights on. ""Okay,"" I start, ""so I can hear them through the vent here--""

And then the cop spots a bloody handprint in the mirror, and his eyes go huge, and he's like, ""Woah, woah, woah,"" and steps back for a second and gives the other guy this look like DUDE GAME FACE, SHIT'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

We had a good laugh about it later, but it was a very tense five seconds -- during which two heavily-armed men standing in my living-room briefly believed that I was some kind of psychotic Batman villain leading them into a second-story bathroom-of-horror funhouse murder surprise.

The moral of the story is: if your significant other has a dark sense of humor, don't let them pick the decorations for your home. It might give some poor cop on the night-shift a heart attack.",So I placed a 911 call tonight...,1

They love each other dearly, have almost no marital issues, and their sex life is especially great. Well....when he's there. You see, this guy makes a lot of money, but has to travel a lot for work. So, naturally, they start to miss each other, and the wife confesses that she misses sex a lot. The husband, being open minded and chill about the whole thing, tells her he has no problems with her going to get masturbatory aids from a sex shop. She's a bit nervous, but after some thinking, she decides to give it a go.

The next day, she's in a local sex shop in her town, and she's looking around. She's never really had any experience with this kind of thing, so she's wandering around looking at things, before she hears ""pssp...."" behind her. She ignores it. ""Pssp....you..."" She turns around and see's an old lady standing beside a door in the back of the shop. So she walks up to the old lady, and the strange elder says ""Come with me, I know what you need for when your husband is on another trip..."" Amazed, the young wife follows the old woman into the back room, only to see a single table with a box on it. The old woman hands the box over and beckons her to open it. Nervously, the young lady opens it, to see a dusty dildo. ""Ma'am...thank you, but I think I just want to buy one from out there.."" she said, looking at the strange gift. The old woman laughs and says ""Oh young lady, that's no ordinary dildo. This one, you see, is magical. If you say 'Magic dildo, my' followed by where you want it, it will pleasure you until you tell it to stop. There's nothing like it. Take it home, try it out. I promise you'll love it..."" Scared, but curious, the young lady thanks the old woman and leaves.

The young woman sits down on her bed when she gets home and looks at the closed box. She undresses, gets under the covers, and quietly says ""....Magic dildo...my vagina..?"" Amazingly, the box bursts open, the dildo flies out, and goes right into her just as she wants it to, and she gets the most amazing orgasm she's ever had. ""MAGIC DILDO, STOP!"" she cries in ecstasy, and it does, going back into the box. 

Naturally, she becomes addicted. She uses it every night that her husband is gone. ""Magic dildo, my vagina"" every night for weeks. But every night, the dildo takes a little longer to actually stop and go back into the box. Until, one night, she's on the couch, squirming in pleasure, until she climaxes and says ""Magic dildo...stop."" It doesn't. ""Magic dildo....stop."" It keeps going inside her. ""MAGIC DILDO, STOP!"" It just keeps going as if she said nothing. Terrified, she awkwardly hobbles to her car after she throws on a dress, and speeds down the highway to get to the sex shop. She arrives, banging on the door. The old woman comes over and opens the door. ""THIS THING WON'T STOP, IT HURTS SO BAD!"" she says. ""Oh sweetheart...Didn't I tell you? Use it too much, and it'll never stop. It needs to find a new owner, or it'll never stop again."" Mortified, the young woman gets back into the car, sobbing, speeding to the hospital. Ten minutes into the drive, she see's police lights behind her. She stops the car and the officer approaches the window. He leans over and says ""Ma'am, do you know you were going over 100 miles per hour...?"" The woman, desperate, cries out ""Sir, I know you won't believe me at first, but there is a magic dildo in me and it won't stop going! I need a doctor!""

The officer stares at her, then laughs.

""Now honey,"" his wife interjects. ""Be honest, tell the officer the truth, you were speeding.""

The man turns his face to his wife, and through clenched teeth he yells, ""Shut-up, Bitch!""

The officer continues, ""I also noticed you aren't wearing your seat belt.""

""No, I had it on, officer,"" the man replies.  ""I took it off just now to get my license out of my wallet.""

""Now honey,"" she says.  ""Don't lie to the officer, you know you weren't wearing your seat belt.""

The man again turns his face to his wife, with more rage in his face, he yells, ""Shut-up, Bitch!!!""

The officer, taken back by their interaction, walks around to the passenger side of the car, and leans in close to the wife.

""M'am, does your husband always speak to you like this?""

""Oh no, officer,"" she replies.  ""Only when he's been drinking.""","Shut-up, Bitch!",0

Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

So he went to a studio to get his commercial made. There he gave an idea of how he wanted his commercial ""I want it to be epic and persuasive, everyone should buy my nails"", he was said to not worry and come back in a week, and the commercial would be made. He came back a week later and he watched his commercial preview.

The scene was grim and dark, unsettling holy music was filling the air and Bob could see a ghastly figure moaning and suffering in the distance. The camera slowly got closer to the mysterious figure. It was Jesus at the cross, having his final moments and making pain noises. Then, the commercial tag came in ""Bob's Nails. Never fails.""

Bob was visibly angry. ""This is outrageous! Preposterous! You will get me in so much trouble if this runs on the TV"". The commercial editor and director had no idea what was wrong with it, but fearing his client would refuse to pay, he asked for a second chance. Bob had to think for a moment, but thinking that it possibly couldn't be worse, agreed. He was there a week later and a new commercial was waiting for him.

The scene this time was a vibrant read and you could see a small field, tension was rising and the music was sharp and nerve wrecking. Suddenly, a man in poor shape came running through the field, wearing teared clothes and had scratches and cuts dripping blood all over his body. Not that far behind him, a huge army of roman soldiers were rushing hot on his trail. We see the man and the soldiers passing the camera and two soldiers are left behind, gasping for breath. 

One looks at the other and slaps his arm.

""Is there a problem, Officer?""

The policeman says, ""Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?""

The driver responds, ""I'd give it to you but I don't have one.""

""You don't have one?""

The man responds, ""I lost it four times for drink driving.""

The policeman is shocked. ""I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?""

""I'm sorry, I can't do that.""

The policeman says, ""Why not?""

""I stole this car.""

The officer says, ""Stole it?""

The man says, ""Yes, and I killed the owner.""

At this point the officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the boot if you want to see.""

The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The senior officer says, ""Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!""

The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The officer responds, ""Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?""

The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.

The officer says, ""Is this your car sir?""

The man says, ""Yes"" and hands over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""

The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""

The man replies, ""I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too!""

Another time, he gave a patient six months to live. At the end of the six months, the patient hadn't paid his bill, So, the doctor gave him another six months.

While he was talking to me, his nurse came in and said, ""Doctor, there is a man here who thinks he's invisible."" The doctor said, ""Tell him I can't see him.""

Another time, a man came running in the office and yelled, ""Doctor, doctor! - my son just swallowed a roll of film!"" The doctor calmly replied, ""Let's just wait and see what develops.""

One patient came in and said, ""Doctor, I have a serious memory problem."" The doctor asked,""When did it start?"" The man replied, ""When did what start?""

My doctor sure has his share of nut cases. One said to him, ""Doctor, I think I'm a bell."" The doctor gave him some pills and said, ""Here, take these - If they don't work, give me a ring.""              
~~~~~
Another guy told the doctor that he thought he was a deck of cards. The doctor simply said, ""Go sit over there. I'll deal with you later.""
~~~~~
When I told my doctor I broke my leg in two places, He told me to stop going to those places. 
~~~~~
You know, doctors can be so frustrating. You wait a month and a half for an appointment, then he says, ""I wish you had come to me sooner.""

A local business was looking for office help. They put a sign in the window saying: 

HELP WANTED Must be a good typist and be good with a computer. Successful applicant must be bilingual. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. 

A short time later a lovely golden retriever dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went inside. He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it, whined and pawed the air. The receptionist called the office manager. He was surprised, to say the least to see a canine applicant. However, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office. 

Inside, the dog jumped up on a chair and stared at the manager expectantly. The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you must be able to type."" The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to quickly type a perfect business letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager, gave it to him, then jumped back up on the chair. 

The manager was stunned, but told the dog, ""That was fantastic, but I'm sorry. The sign clearly says that whoever I hire has to be good with a computer."" 

The dog jumped down again, went to the computer and proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs, produced a sample spreadsheet and database, then presented them to the manager. 

The manager was dumbfounded! He said to the dog, ""Hey, I realize that you are a very intelligent applicant and have fantastic talent, but you're a dog -- no way could I hire you."" 

The dog jumped down and went to the sign in the window and pointed his paw at the words, ""Equal Opportunity Employer."" 

The exasperated manager said, ""Yes, I know what the sign says. But the sign also says you have to be bilingual."" 

The dog looked him straight in the eye and said, ""Meow!!!""

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. 

He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.
