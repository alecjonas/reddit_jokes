The next night the same thing happens and so on and so on and he comes home at the end of the report card period eith an A in mathematics.

In the mean time an Arab dressing as a christian priest stood on the other side of the gate selling Bibles , to which almost all the passers were gathered buying Bibles to vanquish the other two Arabs.

After a while , an Arab tourist passed by the two Muslim and Jewish Arab guys and asked them : (( why are you selling your books here ? Are you stupid ? No body will buy from you ! of course they will buy from the Christian Arab !! This is the Vatican gate ! ))

The two men looked at each other and bursted in a big laugh..!! Then the Jewish guy called the priests saying: 
(( Mark !! Did you hear that ? He is telling us how to do our business ...))

Mark laughed and said:

He asks, “What’s that?” The little girl says, ""that’s my special red race car garage.” 
So later that night the little boy and the little girl try putting his special red race car in her red race car garage, but it doesn’t work. Later that night, in her bedroom, their mother hears a blood curdling scream and runs like hell up the stairs, flips on the lights and sees a puddle of blood on the floor. Their mother asks ""What happened?” Through ragged, shaky breaths, the little girl cries, “We tried putting his car in my garage and it wouldn’t fit... so i cut the back wheels off.”",(NFSW) The worst joke I’ve ever heard.

He was the best detective of his time. But he was no ordinary detective. He could solve every case he encountered with the help of the magical powers bestowed to him by a fairy.

The fairy gave him the power to gain insight on any case by thinking about the case and ejaculating in a special cup. By understanding the clues his semen gave him, he could instantly solve the case.

One day Patrick, the legendary horse rider was suspiciously found dead after winning the championship. Stewart was called to solve the case. This was a tough one.

After reaching the crime scene, Stewart excused himself to the washroom. No wonder he resorted to his trick which only he knew,  and started to rub one out thinking about the case.

The semen gathered in the cup to form the clues, like they always have. Stewart deciphered the clues and to his surprise, the body was a fake, and Patrick had been kidnapped.

The kidnappers had laid out a brilliant plan to profit from Patrick through underground races but were eventually caught. The kidnappers were stunned. It was the perfect crime. They asked the detective. ""But.. but how?""

The doctor came into the room and touched the woman's thigh and sure enough her eyes flickered a little. The doctor said to the nurse ""I wonder if she's responding to sexual simulation"" so he stroked her breast and the woman's eyes flickered again.

Very excited, the nurse ran to the phone and called the lady's husband and told him to come to the hospital straight away. The doctor explained the situation and suggested to the man that maybe, just maybe, if he were to give her oral sex, she might come out of the coma.

So the doctor and nurse left the man alone in the room with his wife and waited outside. Suddenly the alarms started going off and the woman was flat lining.

He replied, still disheartened, ‘That may be true, but we’ve had an influx of visitors from across the border in Prague - they don’t tip well and I barely even break even when they come around!’

Resigned to his fate, taking a deep breath and looking down, he said to me:

Curious, the boy joins the long line of villagers that have gathered to seek the meaning of the sign. The boy watches in frightened wonder as each person in line appears to have a brief conversation with the soothsayer before instantaneously disappearing in a cloud of smoke. Before long, the boy finds himself in front of the oracle. “Good morning, young man. I will tell you what I have told every person before you, and you must listen carefully because the consequences are dire. In 1982, I came across a magic lamp in the Arabian Desert, but to my great misfortune there wasn’t a genie inside, instead, it was the devil himself. Ever since that day, I have been his captive. You see, he utilizes me to harvest souls of the desperate and greedy and the only way that I will ever be freed is if someone answers a ridiculous riddle. A correct answer will not only free my soul but will leave you with endless wealth and a Prince’s title. However, a wrong answer will mean an eternity in hell for you. Once I ask the question, there is no turning back. Are you ready?” The boy thinks for a moment about his starving parents and sister. Petrified, but with no other options, he agrees to the soothsayers proposition. “Ok then young man, what did the Ayatollah say to the flock of seagulls?” All of a sudden an intense nausea overcame the boy. Ghastly pale and on the brink of collapse he asked the soothsayer if it would be possible to think on it and return the following evening. “No one has ever made such a request, but I suppose I must allow it so long as you promise to not speak to a soul and  return by sunset. The devil will know if you do not abide.” With that, the boy thanked the soothsayer and headed the near hundred miles home empty-handed. Once home, exhausted and empty, he gave his parents a sorrowful look and crawled into his bed and cried... knowing he would never solve the riddle. All evening he tossed and turned contemplating the riddle, contemplating Ayatollah’s and seagulls. Nothing. His mind was empty. He had no answers. And before long it was midnight and time to leave for city to accept his fate. He kissed his sleeping parents and sister one last time and sprinted out the door with every last ounce of life left in his tired body. A hundred miles later, he arrived defeated and gasping for breath at the feet of the soothsayer... under the scorching Arabian sun. “Good afternoon, young man,” said the devil’s captive. “I know that you honored our arrangement. I see sadness in your eyes. And as much as it pains me, I must ask you for your final answer. What did the Ayatollah say to the flock of seagulls?” The boy panting and desperate for more time, cried out, pleading “Iran, all night and day!” And with a thunderclap of joy the soothsayer screamed “Fuck Yeah!!!!” as he placed a Prince’s crown on the young mans weary head.",[Original Groaner - You’ll Never Get Your Time Back] A poor boy is wandering the streets of Tehran in search of food...,3

She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me.""

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""

Dave tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ""clean up"" the bird's vocabulary. 

Finally, Dave was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. Dave shook the parrot and the parrot got even angrier and even ruder. Dave, in desperation, threw up his hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he had hurt the parrot, Dave quickly opened the door to the freezer. 

The parrot calmly stepped out onto Dave's outstretched arm and said, ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions.I am sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.""

“OK, here's what you have to do. First, you have to drink that whole bottle of pepper tequila -- the WHOLE thing at once -- and you can't make a face while doing it.

Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta make things right for her.""  

“Well, I know I've paid my $10 bucks,"" says the man, ""but I'm not an idiot. No wonder you've collected so much money -- that's impossible!""  

The new guy proceeds to drink several whiskeys, and eventually, he gets up his nerve.  

“Wherez zat teeqeelah?"" he slurs.  

He grabs the bottle of pepper tequila with both hands and downs it, gulp by gulp. Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but he doesn't make a face. Next, he staggers out back. Everyone in the bar hears a huge scuffle outside -- barking, yelping and growling, then silence.  Just when they think the man must be dead, he staggers back into the bar with his shirt ripped and gashes across his body.  

“NOW,"" he says, ""wherez at ol' lady with the sore tooth?""

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for... ""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, “Get in and I’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!""

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

We arrived at her place which was just a few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

It's been really hard to lead a normal life. It's so bad that if I turn my neck even the slightest to the left or right I'll be hit by a pain so bad it can only be described as someone driving a nail through my neck.

Well as you might expect I've done everything I could to help relieve myself of the pain. I've seen every doctor, had every treatment, taken every medicine, and by God, even smoked the devil's grass. But none of it has worked!

But recently I read an article online about a man who traveled to a monastery out in Tibet who apparently specialized in what is called ""body-healing"". These are people who then, with the mind, are able to heal themselves of all sorts of problems!

So I took the chance, I decided I was going to fly out to Tibet and go see this monastery. I had nothing to lose.

After having landed in Tibet I took a cab out into the mountains and was dropped off walking distance away from the monastery. Once there I was greeted by one of the monks. He eyed me up and down and then looked me in the eyes.

""I sense a great pain coming from you, friend"", he said.

I stayed quiet as he moved his hands up and towards my neck. He grabbed a fast hold and I felt a slight pain.

""I have seen men like you before. No treatment or medicine is strong enough. But we monks have the solution.""

My eyes widened as he uttered the words - words that I will never forget:

The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench.

Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment.

He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . ""In fact"", he pointed out, ""some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society"".

After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, ""Would you like to know what the painting is really about?""

""Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery"", asked the couple?

""Because I am the artist, who painted the picture"", he replied, ""In fact, there are no African Americans depicted at all.

The man says, “Yes, it is.”

Boy - “I have a baseball.”

Boy - “Want to buy it?”

Boy - “$250?

Boy - “$750?

Man - “Fine.”

The boy says, “I can’t, I sold my baseball and my glove.”

The father asks, “How much did you sell them for?”

Boy - “$1,000?

The first evening, the ship’s Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner, who was also the sister of a highly respected Admiral: 

“Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter Melinda’s Debutante Ball. I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance.” 

“They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: “No Jews, please.” ""

Sending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied: “Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending four of my best and most prized officers.” 

“One is a Lieutenant Commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.” 

“The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago, with a BS in 
Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD, in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.” 

“The third officer is also a Lieutenant, with degrees in both computer systems and information technology from SMU and he is awaiting notification on his Doctoral Dissertation from Cal Tech.” 

“Finally, the fourth officer, also a Lieutenant Commander, is our ship’s doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina. We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .” 

Upon receiving this letter, Melinda’s mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous). 

At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda’s mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling Black officers.

The second blonde had to rethink, and decided to ask for a rowing boat, as swimming proved to be no option.Without hesitation a rowing boat appeared before their eyes. She got in, and rowed across.

The driver's name was Shutup, the Passengers name was Manners, and the guy sitting in the backs name was Shit (great parenting right?). While they were on the road, they came across a steep turn, and being the daredevil that he is, Shutup takes the turn as fast as possible. This leads to Shit flying out of his door on the turn. Shutup pulls over and tells Manners to go get him so they can keep moving. After waiting awhile, Shutup gets hungry and decides to take a quick drive down the road to see if theres any restaurants he could grab some food at. On his way down the road, he gets pulled over for speeding. Shutup rolls down his window and the cop walks up and asks him for his license and registration in which he retorts that he forgot both. So the cop asks him ""What's your name?"" and he responds ""Shutup"". The cop, a little irritated says ""Son, if you dont want a bigger consequence, I suggest you tell me your real name now!"" to which Shutup shrugs dramatically and yells ""SHUTUP!"" at the cop. The cop, now angry asks ""Where are your manners?"" and Shutup, smiling now because he knows the answer to this one calmly says ""Down the road picking up Shit"". No one has seen Shutup since.","Pack your things gents, the road is about to get a little bumpy",2

The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.

Now, our friendship didn't last for too long. One night, I was meant to go on a date with my bride-to-be, but she instead went with Joe. She completely forgot about our dinner and instead decided to go with Joe because she found him ""More charming."" Apparently, Joe hit on my girlfriend. I was furious and swore revenge on to Joe.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I went to Joe's house. He was eating breakfast on his table when I went inside. He said ""Oh, hey there, what makes you come here?"" Without answering his question, I slammed his head against the glass table muttering ""Don't mess with my GF."" I ran to my car as fast as I could and drove away before he could catch up to me.

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour later, I got a call from Joe saying that I messed his eye up pretty bad. He could still see with the other one, but he couldn't see from the one I hit for about half a year. There was a cotton patch covering his eye. He said he would keep in touch.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I got a call from my ex-GF. She said that Joe was leaving town and that she was coming with him. I didn't bother with it since she wasn't in touch with me any more. I never got a call from Joe or my GF since. Don't know where they went, either.

""How can you not have water?"" - the man asks angrily

""We do have water, but not H2O. You see, tapwater isn't merely dihydrogen monoxide; it contains many different ions that make water healthy to drink. It would be dangerous to drink pure water"" - replied the bartender

""Oh come on, you knew what I meant! You don't have to misinterpret everything, you smartass!""

""Look, I could lose my job over this! The previous guy got fired for serving hydrogen peroxide to some idiot that asked for a H2O too after his friend who also tried your stupid trick!""

""Where did he even get hydogen peroxide from?""

""Don't ask me, I'm just a bartender""

""Look, could you just please get me some water? It's getting hard to balance on this thing.""

""Why are you on a monocycle anyway?""

""It's a setup for this joke, you wouldn't know. Heck, even I don't excactly know what it is! Something with wheels...""

""Hey, I feel like we're becoming a bit too self-aware now, aren't we?""

""No, why would I do that? It would ruin the joke!""

""You've ruined it now anyway. Tell me, what's the punchline? I want to say it!""

""I told you, I don't know what it is! It's something about wheels and lying. But if we want to get on with the joke, we'll have to guess. Tell you what: I finally get off this monocycle, and you can lie down on the wheel. That has to be funny, right?""

""Yeah, that is pretty funny, actually""

The man gets off the monocycle, and places it on the ground. The bartender, still giggling from how funny the joke will be, lies down on his back on the wheel of the monocycle.

""Now what?""

The man pulls out a glass filled with a transparent substance out of his coat. He pours it onto the bartender's face, who immediately begins screaming uncontrollably as the substance irritates and burns his skin, eyes and mouth. In the last glimpse of his conscience, he realises what has happened: the substance is hydrogen peroxide, and the man is actually the previous bartender that got fired.

The man then turns to the camera, and whispers:

Now, apples and beans I'd heard help with his particular set of problems, but the soup was news to me. I didn't comment on it at time, though, since I figured he probably just wanted something quick to eat that wouldn't hurt his intestines.

So I go to the store, pick up these groceries, and drive them straight to his house. I go in to set them down, and he immediately asks for some of the soup. I figure the poor guy must be starving, so I go ahead and heat some up and bring it to him.

Soon as I do, be chugs it down and immediately runs off to the bathroom. When he comes back, he tells me he's feeling much better.

Shocked the woman leaves and returns later in the day now having changed her hair colour to brunette. Once again she asks the salesman “excuse me, I’d like to buy this TV”

To which she is met with the same response “I’m sorry ma’am we don’t sell to blondes”

To which he responds “sorry ma’am we don’t sell to blondes”

Now she is FURIOUS and heads out to plan the perfect deception. She once again changes her hair colour to black, gets a new haircut, changes her outfit, and even gets plastic surgery to look completely different in an attempt to buy from this shop.

She returns having looked nothing like she did the previous days and once again asks the salesman “excuse me, I’d like to buy this TV” 

To which he once again responds “sorry ma’am we don’t sell to blondes”

post,c3vqvm,2qh72,jokes,false,1561243106,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c3vqvm/robin_hucking/,self.jokes,,"I once knew a guy named Robin. Robin Hucking. Yes, Robin. He hated his name. Everyone called him Hucking, or Huck.

&amp;#x200B;

Great guy. Best friend I ever had. Right up to the day he died.

&amp;#x200B;

Hucking did have one problem. He was a high rise construction worker with a bad case of acrophobia.

Ever see a guy working while lying down? That was Huck.  But he still got the job done. He'd wear blinders so he had no peripheral vision, and always faced inward. If he so much got a glimpse of overboard, bam, he'd go down like a bird shit, and stay there, eyes closed, holding onto something - anything as if his life was sliding to the edge.  And maybe it was.

&amp;#x200B;

It really bothered him that he had this debilitating fear of heights. We used to talk about it over beers when the conversation wound that way.

He just could not understand how some people can walk a 4 inch beam at 600 feet up. Said once he looked down, he got dizzy, and would start losing his balance.  I recommended he change careers, but he wouldn't. It's good money, and having dropped out of school in 8th grade, it was all he knew.

&amp;#x200B;

He started drinking more and more, and I thnk he dipped into other substances.  We sometimes do what we have to do to cope.

His wife left him, and took the dog. I think losing the dog is what truly broke his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Hucking was never the same after that. He sobered up, cleaned up, but he went dark. I never saw him smile after he lost his dog.

He'd go home, and just sit in the dark. He covered the windows, and it was pitch black. No tv, no books, no nothing. Just sit.

Often I'd go sit with him, but it's creepy, man, all alone with your thoughts. Can drive a man mad.

But I could see that it helped him to have someone share the dark with him, so I kept coming.

I asked him once what he would think about. He just kinda shrugged, and said 'Stuff.'

&amp;#x200B;

Showed up to work every day, though. Squeeze his eyes shut and hold on for dear life on the lift up, and then get right to work.

Boss said he did the best welds he ever saw, but swore half the time he walked by, Hucking was welding with his eyes shut.  Laying down when he could.

He denied it when I asked, but he said he did not need to watch the weld directly. He could feel it.

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 years after his wife took his dog away, he got a new one. Nothing special, just a Heinz 57 varieties of mutt from the pound, a rescue dog. Never was quite sure who rescued who.

A year after that, he found a new woman, and started coming back to life. She took all the covers off the windows, and he started to smile again.

She even convinced him to start going out, and they went to Cancun.

&amp;#x200B;

I never knew him so happy.  And that made me happy.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I ever saw my friend, I just dropped by out of the blue, and we shot the shit for a few, and we had plans to meet up the next day for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to his work to meet him for lunch, and all I saw was police and paramedics and fire trucks.

&amp;#x200B;

And I knew. I just knew.

&amp;#x200B;

But it didn't really register until I heard an annoyed passerby mutter,

&amp;#x200B;

'Hucking fell?'",Robin Hucking,5

The son’s name was Malcom and Malcom’s father loved him very much as he was a single father giving all his love to his son, Malcom.

When Malcom turned 14, his father asked him what he would like for his birthday. Malcom just replied with a single lightbulb. His father looked at him in confusion but nevertheless got a single lightbulb and wrapped it up and gave it to his son. Malcom opened the gift and stared in awe, “Gee, thanks dad! Love this gift!” His father smiled and they hugged each other.

Another year rolled past, and on Malcom’s 15th birthday, his father asked what he wanted. Malcom thought for a while and finally decided on a box of lightbulbs. His father looked at him in confusion but nevertheless got a box of lightbulbs and wrapped it up and gave it to his son. Malcom opened the gift and stared in awe, “Gee, thanks dad! Love this gift!” His father smiled and they hugged each other.

Once again, another year rolled around, and on Malcom’s 16th birthday, his father asked him yet the same old question. Malcom again, stared at the ceiling thinking hard about it. Malcom replied with a ROOM FULL OF LIGHTBULBS. His father looked at him in confusion but nevertheless got a full room fulled with lightbulbs and gave it to his son. Malcom opened the gift and stared in awe, “Gee, thanks dad! Love this gift!” Malcom jumped in joy and his father smiled and they hugged each other.

On Malcom’s 17th birthday, his dad came around to his room and asked him the same old question. What would he like for his 17th birthday. Malcom thought hard and this time it was a different expression. 

“Dad... I want a warehouse full of lightbulbs...” he mumbled.

His dad, shocked, replied with a stutter. He was flabbergasted, not knowing at all what to do next. He nodded his head and said. Yes son. I will try my best.

The next day came and Malcom was with his dad on his way to the warehouse. His father opened the large door and spilling out was a whole lot of lightbulbs. There must’ve been at least a million! Malcom jumped gleefully up and down and cried out best birthday gift ever! His father smiled and they both hugged each other.

For Malcom’s 18th birthday, his father asked Malcom if he would like tuition money for college. Malcom thought about the offer but replied with no dad. I want a whole mansion filled with lightbulbs. His dad replied with a simple no and requested he followed him to his car.

Once they were about 5 minutes into driving, Malcom’s father turned to him and questioned him, “Son... for over 4 years, I’ve given you quite a bit of lightbulbs... and I would like to know what you are doing with the lightbulbs,” 

Malcom too focused on his college papers ignored his father. His dad furious, snapped at Malcom, however this ended up making his father lose control of the steering wheel and they both slammed into a tree. Unfortunately for Malcom, the passenger seat was crippled by a long branch and Malcom was rushed to the hospital.

The next day, Malcom’s father came into the ER. He placed himself calmly next to Malcom. 

“Son, I’m so sorry about what happened yesterday. For my actions, what would you like me to do?”

“I...I... I want a box of lightbulbs...” he hoarsely replied.

His father nodded and without another word he came back with a box wrapped up and placed it on top of Malcom’s stomach. Malcom began to unravel the box and opened it. To no one’s surprise, it was average grade lightbulbs. They both looked at each other happily and smiles.

“Son, I know that you were in a terrible accident with me yesterday... but I really must know what you were doing with all these lightbulbs,”

His son placed the lightbulbs on the side. 

“I...I...”
