So the boy started off to town. He came up to a prostitute that was uglier than an ass. The hooker looked straight at the boy and said, ""The fucking begins at $10, you got $10?"" The boy had no money, so he started to walk away, but the hooker stopped him and said that she would accept that duck in his hands instead of $10. The boy gleefully accepted, so they went off and had sex. An hour later, as the boy was leaving, the hooker pleaded that he fuck her again because it was the best fucking of her life. She offered him the duck back, and they went at it again. Another hour passes, and the boy heads home, duck in hand. On the way, the duck gets spooked and flies from the boy’s hands and flew directly into the path of an oncoming car, obliterating the duck. The man driving gets out and appologizes for the boy’s duck. The man hands the boy 25 dollars for his trouble and goes on his way. 

Later, the boy goes home and hands his father 25 dollars. The father notices that his son looks exhausted and asks him, ""What happened?"" The boy’s reply was this: ""I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 25 bucks for a fucked up duck."" ","So there was this farmer, his son...",68

One of them was a hard-core misogynist and claimed that women were never any good at maths, especially the blonde ones. His friend claimed that there was no difference and that women were just as capable as men. When the misogynist went for a cigarette, the other guy called over the blonde waitress.

“My friend and I are having an argument. When he gets back I’ll call you over and ask you a question. The answer you need to give is ‘a third X cubed’. Can you do that?”

“Thurdeks coobed?”

“a third X cubed.”

“a Third Ekscubed. Sure I can do that.”

The other chap comes back to the table and his friend says.

“I’ll prove to you that women are as good as men at maths. See the blond waitress; I’ll ask her a question and we’ll see if she knows any maths.”

So he calls the waitress over and asks, “What is the integral of X squared?”

As quick as a shot, she comes out with “A third X cubed.”

The misogynist is stunned. The waitress smiles and walks away.

Then she stops and calls back, “plus a constant.”

As they head back home, right before dawn, both of them drunk, they felt the urge to pee. The only place to stop was a cemetery.  Scared and drunk, they stopped and decided to go there anyway.

The first one did not have anything to clean herself with, so she took off her panties, used them to clean herself and discarded them.

The second not finding anything either, thought, “I’m not getting rid of my panties . . .” so she used the ribbon of a flower wreath to clean herself.

The morning after, the two husbands were talking to each other on the phone, and one says to the other, “We have to be on the look-out.  It seems that these two were up to no good last night.  My wife came home without her panties!”

After a few minutes of suction the device starts to hurt and he realises that this isn't going exactly how he envisioned it. He begins to look around for a release or some sort of off switch, but to no avail. Eventually he gives up and calls the company that makes the device, the pain getting to a much less bearable level now. Once on the phone he struggles through the pain and says 'I just purchased your milk extractor and I notice that there's no way of getting the cows off once the machine starts'

Eric, thinking surely P'tu can't be worse than death. He is however a cautious man, so he nods his head to speak. The chief indicates to his men to remove the gag. Eric asks ""What is P'tu?""
The chief replies ""It is our tribe's test of manhood where you must complete 3 death defying trials. If you complete them and survive, then you shall be set free."" Eric now thinking he may have been given a break, though still cautious he asks ""What are these 3 tasks?"" The chief explains ""You must go in the the first hut and drink 10 gourds of kvasswoo, this is our alcoholic drink made with spit and the fermented leaf of the juju tree."" The chief grabs the explorer's arm and says ""one gourd of kvasswoo is enough to floor the whole tribe.""

He's cooking with his wife's Uncle on thanksgiving, let's call him Lenny. Lenny pulls a Pumpkin Pie out of the oven and is like ""Hmm... I dunno, I've never been too good with these things, can neeeever tell if it's fully cooked.""

So Brad's like ""It's all good, just pop your finger in and see if she's done""

Uncle Lenny laughs ""Haha! Wish I could check the Ol' Lady like that!"" They laugh.

Christmas comes around, and everyone seems to be having a good time when Brad hears the kids running around the Dessert table and saying that old familiar punchline.

""POP YOUR FINGER IN, SEE IF SHE'S DONE! HAHAHA! JUST POP YOUR FINGER IN!""

So he blushes and is like oh okay what the fuck but whatever maybe it's just a coincidence, leaves the dinner room and goes out into the living room where Uncle Lenny is just having Coffee slowly with a long refreshing ""ahhhhh don't you just love the holidays?""

2 years go buy and it's Brad's Birthday- He's about to blow out the candles when his wife says ""Oh, wait! Honey, don't forget to POP YOUR FINGER IN AND SEE IF SHE'S DONE!"" The ENTIRE family laughs, Uncle Lenny nudges him with an Elbow and winks.

Finally Brad's like y'know what, enough, this isn't even appropriate and it's not even that funny of a joke, I'm going the fuck over there and we're taking this goddamn joke off the table.

So he gets in his car, Drives to Uncle Lenny's- no one's home but Lenny so he knocks on the door and Lenny Answers: ""I figured you were gonna pop in! What, just to-""

""Yeah yeah yeah check if she's done listen man the joke has to fucking stop. It's gross. It's not funny, and it's gross Lenny- you made it like what, 5 years ago now? Cheryl isn't even with us anymore Lenny, Cheryl is Dead, Cheryl is dead and I cannot believe you keep making this reference it is completely inappropriate Lenny. You need some fucking Help. You need. Help.""

So Lenny looks at the ground, clears his throat, wipes a tear from his eye haphazardly and invites Brad in. ""Can I... Can I just show you something he asks?""

At this point, Brad felt pretty awful so he obliged and walked inside. They headed to a large blue door with a diamond knob- Lenny Cleared his throat before he entered. ""C'mon on, there's lots of memories awaitin'"". So he joined him.

It was a room full of photos and memories- pictures of his wife as a child and her cousins, and Lenny and Cheryl and their wedding pictures as well as their families. He picked up a photo of Billy, his son.

""This is Billy right after his graduation...""  
""Billy is 14, Lenny!""  
""Cubscouts, Brad. And y'know what I said to him that day? Y'know what I said to him right before that picture?""

Brad felt terrible- he knew. He probably told him the joke.

""I looked right into his little 10 year old eyes and I said-"" he choked a little, then continued ""I said You go out there into the world, and you put your finger in it and you make sure shes done for ya, ya hear me?""

""God, I just, I didn't know it was so important to-""

""And this one? Of Cheryl's Grandmother before she passed? Do you know what her last words were?""

""...God, I'm so sorry Lenny""

""She said 'LENROY, YOU MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR FINGER IN HER AND MAKE SURE SHE'S DONE' before she flatlined!""

""I had no idea!""

""HOW COULD YOU KNOW? IT WAS JUST A JOKE TO YOU."" He passed glances over the pictures. ""...But I hope you understand now... I hope you understand how important it is for you to have said something so special, so endearing for this family. We love you, Brad, and we're all here for you if you ever want to talk.""

""Thanks Lenny. I should... Probably get going.""

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going.  Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was.  It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra  Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her.  She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully.  He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple.  He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.",There was a woman.,200

Out of embarrassment she insisted that the surgery be kept a secret and the surgeon agreed.

Awakening from the anesthesia after the surgery she found three roses carefully placed beside her on the bed.

Outraged, she immediately calls in the doctor. ""I thought I asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!""

The surgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him: ""I felt sad because you went through this all by yourself.""

""The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery and empathized because she had had the same procedure done some time ago.""

""And what about the third rose?"" she asked.

""Oh, that rose is from a man upstairs in the burn unit. He wanted to thank you for his new ears.""

As he stops at a red light a huge cloud stopped next to his, it was a luxurious one, plenty of beautiful young women drinking and dancing.

St Peter kept calm and told him: ""Look, in the record book you can see you made 835 people pray all along your priesthood, it's quite a number. But the guy you're talking to me about was an Air Congo's pilot, he made around 20 flights per week during 14 years, with un average of 250 people per flight praying at every take off, so please don't tell me he doesn't deserve that cloud...""",so this priest passes away and gets to Heaven,40

**A young man with a few hours** to spare one afternoon figures that if he hurries and plays very fast, he can get in nine holes before he has to head home. As he is about to tee off, an old gentleman shuffles onto the tee and asks if he can join him. Although worried this will slow him up, the younger man says, “Of course.”

To his surprise, the old man plays quickly. He doesn’t hit the ball very far, but it goes straight. Furthermore, the old man moves along without wasting any time.

When they reach the 9th fairway, the young man is facing a tough shot. A large pine tree sits in front of his ball, directly between it and the green.

After several minutes pondering how to hit the shot, the old man says, “You know, when I was your age, I’d hit the ball right over that tree.”

With the challenge before him, the young man swings hard, hits the ball, watches it fly into the branches, rattle around, and land with a thud a foot from where it had started.

“Of course,” says the old man, “when I was your age, that tree was only three feet tall.”",A young man with a few hours to spare one afternoon figures that if he hurries and plays very fast,1408

Ring up the sales as listed. What ever you do, DO NOT  give anyone advice. I’ll be back soon”

After a few minutes, a man approached the “pharmacist” for some advice.

“I need something for this cough. It has kept me up all night, I’m exhausted. My wife says I’m keeping her up, as well”.

The man appeared quite tired, and the pharmacists’ son knew ‘just the thing’ to give the ailing man.

“Here you go sir. Take two tablespoons of this, and it will cure what ails you.”  He rang up the elixir, and the man thanked him, and immediately took a swig.

About a half hour later, the pharmacist/father returned to the pharmacy.

“How did things go?”, he asked his son, “I see you made some sales,”

“Father, all went well. I did, however, give away some advice, though. An extremely tired man came in with a terrible cough. I couldn’t help but giving him something that would work”

“What did you tell him?” The pharmacist worried...

“I told him two tablespoons of cod liver oil would cure that cough immediately.”, replied the son.

“COD LIVER OIL!! that’s no cough elixir!  That will do nothing for his cough!!” The pharmacist began to break a sweat, knowing surely he would be hearing from this irate customer in the next few days..

“Father,  you are incorrect! Over there, through the window! See the man, holding on tight to the light pole with his legs crossed tight? That joker ain’t gonna cough any time soon!!”",Something for that cough,5

They realized this might be her last year, and each decided to get something special for her.

The first got thought that she must find the same old house boring after living in it for all her life and bought her a mansion. The second wonders if she could use some help getting around and buys her a limousine and driver.
The third, being the smartest, trains a parrot to be able to read for her, as her eyesight has deteriorated.

Their mother, being old fashioned, writes a letter to each of them.

To the first she writes,
""My oldest son, I thank you kindly for the mansion. However, I have no use for it as I only really need a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen, so I donated the estate to the orphanage so that they would have more rooms.""

To the second she writes,
""My son, Thank you so much for the limousine and chauffeure. But I have no need for a car at all because the only place I ever go is the church, which is right next door.
I gave it to the church, so that they can carpool churchgoers from far away.""

To the third she writes,
""My youngest son, your gift was the best and most practical present I got today. The turkey was great.""",An old woman is having her 90th birthday.,20

He explains to the men that souls may board a train from here that will take them the rest of the way up to heaven. However, the train runs on a schedule, and is nearly full.

""I'm sorry fellers"" says the ticket man. 
""The only seats I have left are for folks who died a strange and tragic death."" 

The first man steps forward. ""I died a strange and tragic death"" he says. 

""You did? Well then, please tell us your story"" says the ticket man. 

The first man begins. ""I was living on the 20th floor of a rather nice apartment building with a balcony. One day, as I stood out on the balcony, I slipped and fell over the railing. I fell for 10 stories. But somehow, miraculously, I caught onto another balcony railing to stop my fall. 

'Thank God' I thought to myself. 'I'm still alive!'  

But then, some asshole comes out onto the balcony and starts beating on my hands! I kept pleading him to stop until finally he got frustrated and went back inside. 

'Thank God' I thought to myself. 'I'm still alive!'

But then, the same asshole comes out again with a sledgehammer and breaks my hands with it. I fell another 10 stories into the bushes below. But somehow, miraculously, I survived!

'Thank God' I thought to myself. 'I'm still alive!'

But then the asshole goes back into his apartment, grabs a god damned REFRIGERATOR and throws it over the balcony. It fell on me and I died.""

The ticket man shakes his head in pity. ""That is a very strange and tragic death"" he says. He gives the first man a ticket and lets him board the train. 

The second man steps forward. ""I too, died a strange and tragic death"" he says. The ticket man asks for his story. 

""Now, my wife and I lived together on the 10th floor of a pretty nice apartment. Everything was great, until I started to suspect my wife was cheating on me. One day I came home from work and sure enough, I find some bastard hanging from my balcony! In a rage, I started beating on his hands but he wouldn't let go. 

'God dammit' I thought to myself. 'He's still alive!'

So I go back into my apartment and get the sledge hammer. I break the bastard's hands and he falls 10 stories down into the bushes. But somehow, I still hear him moaning in the bushes. 

'God dammit' I thought to myself. 'He's still alive!'

So finally I grab the refrigerator and I heave it over the balcony. But the cord wraps around my leg at the last second, so the fridge pulls me down with it and I die.""

The ticket man pauses. ""That is a very... strange and tragic death."" He hands the second man a ticket and allows him to board the train. 

Finally the third man steps forward. ""Uh. I uh... also have a strange and tragic death"" he starts. 

The ticket man holds up his hand ""let me guess, you were banging the last guy's wife"". 

The third man shakes his head, and with a long sigh, begins his story. 

""I lived in a refrigerator"".

The first guy immediately blurts out, ""I want a billion dollars.""

POOF! He's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says, ""I want to be the richest man alive.""

POOF! He's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says, ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.""

POOF! His arm starts rotating.

The genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says, ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.""

POOF! A stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says, ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.""

POOF! His looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says, ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.""

POOF! Now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says, ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.""

POOF! His complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says, ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.""

POOF! He looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says, ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.""

POOF! He's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

First guy is ecstatic, ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

Second guy smiles and says, ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says, ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""","3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp.

post,aar5kk,2qh72,jokes,false,1546132047,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aar5kk/the_wanderer/,self.jokes,,"There once was a young boy who was abandoned by his parents on the day he was born. He once had a name, but it has long since been forgotten. He grew up in an orphanage, lonely and sad, eating poorly and being bullied by the other children. The boy was awkward and gangly and was forced to watch his peers grow older and be adopted while he simply aged, waiting for the day when he came of age so he could rid himself of this terrible place and explore the world. As the years went on, he grew more and more dejected with his lot in life. The only bright spot in his miserable days was that there was an old man across the street from the orphanage who had a swimming pool. The man took a liking to the boy, and told him that he was free to swim in the pool any time he pleased. The boy was more than happy to accept, and discovered within himself a great passion for swimming and diving. He spent hours a day perfecting his flips and turns, entering the water as gracefully as a swan. But sadly, even this couldn't end well for him. The old man passed away and the new owners of the pool were not nearly as obliging. 

The boy finally came of age and moved out of the orphanage. This is when he earned his title: The Wanderer. He set off on his own with just the clothes on his back and the shoes on his feet to explore the world. He traveled through Europe and Asia, staying in hostels and working for his meals. He hiked through Africa and hitchhiked across America, determined to see everything that was kept from him in his early life. 

One fateful afternoon found The Wanderer in Manhattan. As he wandered through Times Square, he noticed a businesswoman walking through the street, looking down at her phone. Seeing a bus barreling towards her, he acted on instinct. He ran into the street, tackling the woman out of harms way without a second to spare. As he helped her to her feet, she thanked him profusely. Dusting herself off, she said to him, ""Thank you for saving my life! I'm the wealthiest woman in New York, please, is there anything I can do for you?""

""Think nothing of it,"" The Wanderer replied graciously. ""If you must thank me, $100 would be  more than enough compensation.""

""Are you sure?"" asked the businesswoman. ""I could give you $100,000 and never notice it was gone!""

The Wanderer insisted that $100 would be more than enough, but before the businesswoman left, she handed him her card, and made him promise to call her if he ever needed anything. The Wanderer thanked her again and wandered off to find a pay phone. 

The Wanderer flipped through a phone book and found the number of a travel agent. The Wanderer dialed the number and asked the travel agent what cruise he could take for $100. The travel agent, whose job had been largely replaced by the internet, was happy for the work and found him a cruise leaving the following morning. 

$100 is not nearly enough money for a proper cruise experience, so when The Wanderer boarded the ship, he discovered his room to be a simple 10' x 10', with a threadbare mattress, no window, and a single, uncovered light bulb. His room was deep below decks and next to the galley, but The Wanderer, being the person he was, decided to make the best of the situation. He helped out the crew in the kitchen and their maintenance work, accustomed as he was to working for lodging and meals, for the duration of the cruise. He was well liked by the ships staff, and even noticed by the captain. When the ship returned to harbor and The Wanderer was preparing to disembark, the captain approached him. 

""I know your room was a simple 10' x 10', with a threadbare mattress, no window, and a single, uncovered light bulb, deep below decks and next to the galley, but you didn't have to spend your entire vacation working for the crew,"" said the captain. ""Please, if there is anything I can do for you to thank you for your help, just say the word.""

The Wanderer thought for a moment, then requested that the captain allow him to dive off the side of the ship. Nonplussed by this odd request, the captain obliged, and was greeted by a showing of the most magnificent dives and acrobatics she had ever seen. A crowd gathered to see The Wanderer's daring feats as he soared through the air and entered the water without a splash, throwing tips into his hat on the deck of the ship. Seeing how good he was for business, the captain invited The Wanderer to stay aboard as a permanent entertainer for the cruise line. The Wanderer, who had never had a place to call home before, gladly accepted. 

Years went on and The Wanderer's reputation spread, until one day he approached the captain.

""After years of wandering,"" he said, ""I think I have discovered my purpose. I am going to be the first person to dive off a mile-high diving board, and I would like to do it on my new home. May I build my diving board on your deck?""

The captain obliged, but asked The Wanderer how he was going to pay for such an expensive project. The Wanderer drew a business card from his tattered wallet and decided to give the businesswoman a call.

Thus began the most ambitious project in history: the construction of a mile-high diving board on the deck of a cruise ship. It took many months and garnered so much attention that on the day of its completion, there were thousands of people in attendance, hoping to see The Wanderer's stunt. Everyone he had met on his travels came, from Africa and Asia and Europe and all 50 states, reporters and celebrities and the businesswoman and the owners of the orphanage, people flocked from around the world to see the man who had nothing all his life make something of himself. 

And so the time came. The Wanderer began to ascend the ladder, climbing up rung by rung, a mile into the sky. After a long hour, he reached the top, and prepared to jump. 

But, as always, something had to go wrong for The Wanderer. A gust of wind caught the ship as he jumped, blowing him back just a few feet. As he fell, all the onlookers came to the same grim realization: The Wanderer was not going to land in the water.

He tumbled through the air, flipping and twirling and hurtling towards the deck of the ship, with thousands staring in horror at his impending doom.

WHAM. He smashed through the deck of the ship, through the floors below, through the ceiling that suspended his single, uncovered light bulb, through his threadbare mattress, down and down. People crowded to the sides of the ship, prepared to see The Wanderer's disfigured body float up through the water.

But one savvy reporter spotted a hand reach up and grab on to the edge of the hole where The Wanderer had fallen through the ship. Hoisting himself through the gap was none other than The Wanderer himself.

The reporter rushed to his side, asking him incredulously how he had survived such a terrible fall.

The wander brushed himself off and responded, ""In my life, I have been through many hard ships.""",The Wanderer,88

The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals. Many years passed by like that. At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard. With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked: Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off. A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked: Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man: Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon. Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man: Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger: Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard. Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked: Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time. Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked: But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked: Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it? All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone. The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.,1

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around. When the fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fireman in charge and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give 50,000 pounds to the fire department that brings them out intact.""

But the roaring flames held the fire-fighters off. Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now 100,000 pounds to the fire station who could bring out the company's secret files. But still the fire fighters could not get through. 

From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby rural township volunteer fire brigade, composed mainly of old men over 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant. Without even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno.

Outside, the other firemen watched as the old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before. Within a short time, the old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to 200,000 pounds and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.

The local TV station caught the thank you on film and asked the chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""

So the oldest was named One, and the youngest was named Ninety
One day, while everyone was asleep, a fire broke out in their house. Luckily, Ninety was able to wake up and flee the house unharmed. However, the fire department later told her that she was the only survivor. Her parents, along with children One to Eighty-nine, had burned to death. They were also able to discover that the fire has been caused by the family’s dog knocking over a candlestick, which fell on a stack of papers, setting the house on fire.
Ninety, only being 8 years old, was placed in an orphanage. Sadly, no one every adopted Ninety, and she grew up in the orphanage until she was an adult. Ninety had always blamed the dog for her family’s death. She felt that she would be living a normal life, instead of living in a orphanage, if it weren’t for that stupid dog.
Ninety’s life took a turn for the better when she left the orphanage, when she met a lovely young man named Dave. Dave and Ninety instantly fell in love, and got married six months after meeting each other. One year later, Dave and Ninety has their first child. They named him John, after Ninety’s father.
Years later, Dave and Ninety had two more children. They named them Jake and Phil. John, Jake, and Phil always got along great. Every weekend they would go out in the park and play ball. One day, when John, Jake, and Phil were at the park, they found a stray dog. These children loved the dog. 

They played with it for the entire day, and wondered if they could keep it.
John reminded Jake and Phil about their mother’s hatred for dogs. Because of her family’s death because of their dog, there would be no way she would allow them to keep it. So the kids devised a plan. They would keep the dog in the basement, and every day, they would take turns going down to feed the dog. And they would name it “This”. 

So whenever they were referring to it, they could say something like “go check on This” without arousing suspicion.
The plan worked perfectly for the following week. Everyone had their turn to check on This, and their parents never knew. Then, one day, after Phil’s turn to feed This, he forgot to shut the basement door. 

The next day, when it was John’s turn, he saw that This had run away.
John, Jake, and Phil spend the next few days doing nothing but searching all across town for their dog. Eventually, after days and days without finding anything, they decided to call off the search.
Looking back, no one besides John, Jake and Phil knew about their dog. They never told their parents or their friends or anyone. No one else even knew that This had existed.
Only Ninety’s kids will remember This.",There was once a woman with 90 children.,54

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. 

As a teenage guy going through puberty, this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time, i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. 

She was a little too hipster punk for me, listening to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. 

As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commanded. 

I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.","Since I was a young boy,",50

And at the beginning of their marriage 50 years before, they had both solemnly sworn to each other to provide the other with a desired sexual favor on their 50th anniversary, no questions asked. Irving, being pushy, insists on getting his favor first. He knows his wife is a prude so whatever she asks for probably won't be kinky or wild. 

She resignedly agrees, and says ""all right what is it you want Irving""
Irving says ""well I've always wanted you to suck my cock and take my cum in your mouth. I know you've never liked that so I've always wanted it"" Mabel hems and haws at first, but then Irving reminds her in no uncertain terms that the favor was to be no questions asked, so she reluctantly does her duty.
 Irving fucks her face roughly for a few minutes and then shoots his load right into her mouth, gagging her as he finishes. He sighs contentedly as he does his pants back up and says ""okay then wife, what is it that you would like?""

Without missing a beat, Mabel stands up and says

Out of these, one of the most prolific judges was Justice Dushyant Nayadu. He was well known for his well reasoned, concise, forward thinking verdicts. He was also known to be a liberal judge as regards clothing as well, for he made it a point to wear a neon tie to court to ""lighten the mood"". 

On the other hand, there was another judge in the same court. This judge was Justice Dayan Lade, and he was infamous for his conservative, complicated judgments and unwavering favouritism of rich corporations, but well known for his spotless white hat which he wore in court. 

However, these judges were thought to not be able to stand each other (for very understandable reasons), for they were never seen together, even at social events. One day, when an important case was set to be heard, neither judge was anywhere to be found. The police searched frantically, and finally found, in the basement of Justice Dayan Lade's apartment, the unconscious body of one man, with a neon tie and a white hat by his side. 

Detailed analysis proved that the man was suffering from a split personality disorder, and kept masquerading back and forth between his two secret identities, which also explained why the two judges were never seen together. 

I guess all of this just goes to show that Justice D. Lade is Justice D. Nayadu.",(First time posting) An original one I wrote while bored in class one day,1

After giving it some thought, the director decides to film the movie in portrait mode instead of the typical landscape. After all, there are a lot of videos out there in portrait mode, but no full-length movies. It will be revolutionary!

After bringing the idea to the production company, the director meets resistance. The production company says ""We can't do that, the screen is wide! We would only be able to use a small part of the screen and nobody in the theater will be able to see it very well. Furthermore, everyone's TVs are wide as well. How will people watch this film?""

The director has another idea. ""How about everyone watches the movie on their phones? That way we don't have to spend any money to re-purpose the theater and there is no issue with people not being able to see. It's genius!""

The producers are speechless at this proposal and glare at the now defensive film-maker. After some moments of silence, the director asks, ""What, do you guys not have phones?""","For the new year, a film director decides how to shoot a movie.",0

After six months or so of almost total isolation, he's finishing dinner  when someone knocks on his door. He opens it and there is a big, bearded and burly hillbilly standing there. ""Name's Enoch...

 ""Not a problem... After 25 years in the sales business, I can drink

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",451

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",One of my favorite jokes,6852

Just so happens that this bear's home is nearby Butte, Montana, and he found it pretty easy to find a bar. He walks on in, takes a stool, lays his big furry paws on the bar and says, ""Hello, barkeep. I just woke up from a long winter sleep and I've a hankering for a beer. Might you serve me up one of your finest brews?""

Bartender looks at the bear apologetically and says, ""I'm sorry to break it to you. New city ordinance... we can no longer serve beers to bears in bars in Butte, Montana. ""

The bear was miffed and a bit in shock, but he left the bar and thought for a while outside. He decided he was going to go a bit down the road here and see if the next bar would serve him. 

Next bar he found, he sauntered inside, hulked over the bar and was a bit less polite this time. ""BARKEEP! Get me a BEER!""

The bartender was a bit jostled by this angry bear in his bar, but he stuck to his guns, telling the bear that he was now unable to serve beers to bears in bars in Butte, Montana.

The bear growled and grumbled to himself as he stomped away, and stood for a moment outside thinking to himself that he was going to get a beer, whatever he had to do. He skulked off to find a third and final bar where he WOULD be getting his beer come hell or high water.

THIS bar actually had a sign outside on the door that said, ""NEW CITY ORDINANCE, NO BEER WILL BE SERVED TO BEARS IN BARS IN BUTTE, MONTANA,"" and this made the bear furious.

The bear tore the door off the establishment and lumbered over to the bartender, who, unlike everyone else in the establishment, was cool as a cucumber. ""Hello, mister bear! Can I get you a soda?""

The bear says, ""YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE ME A BEER.""

Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't sell beers to bears in bars in Butte, Montana.""

The bear says, ""You WILL SERVE ME A BEER OR I WILL EAT THE WOMAN AT THE END OF THE BAR."" He motioned to the weathered old regular at the end of the bar, as she quivered, terrified.

The Bartender looks at the woman, looks at the bear, shrugs and says, ""sorry. We can't sell beers to...""

And before he could finish his sentence, the bear was upon the woman, ripping her apart limb from limb, consuming all her fleshy bits until there was nothing but carcass on the barroom floor.

The bear says, ""NOW SERVE ME A BEER OR YOU'RE NEXT.""

The bartender, unshook, shakes his head sadly and says, ""sorry. We don't sell beers to bears on drugs in bars in Butte, Montana.""

The bear is confused and frustrated and angry, throws his shaggy paws up into the air in disbelief and slams them onto the bar. ""DRUGS??? DRUGS??? I'm NOT on DRUGS!""

The bartender nodded solemnly, explaining, ""that was a bar-bitch-u-ate.""","Bears in Bars in Butte, Montana",15

A few days passed, he’d gone on no dates, had no meaningful conversation, and began to feel hopeless. When, almost through the force of his own will, the “You got a new match! 😍😍😍” appeared on his screen for the first time that day. Eagerly, he opened his screen and found a profile of a very average brunette he’d swiped on mindlessly a few days ago simply named “Bad.”

They began to chat, and, after a few shared compliments and successful pickup lines, they decided to go on a date. 

Things were going well, Really was nervous as he’d never been so interested in a girl so quickly whom he’d thought was also interested in him. She arrives and dinner goes well, they flirt throughout the evening and Really even offers to pay the monumental check. Really, in a blissful stupor, hastily asks his date back to his place for some drinks and dancing. She gladly agrees and they begin to head back to Really’s apartment. 

On their way they bump hands and slowly get closer and closer until they’re all but making out in front of Really’s bedroom door.

He gets absorbed in the rustic atmosphere, but in the midst of drinking a Guinness, he notices what appears to be a ghoul drinking from a small green bottle, across the room. This person has sallow skin, narrow cheekbones, and bloodshot eyes, which makes Bill feel unnerved enough to leave the pub without finishing his drink. Bill goes to another crowded pub in the village, but minutes into drinking from a Jameson, he notices the exact the same ghastly stranger drinking from a green bottle. Yet again, Bill leaves without finishing his drink, and heads for a third pub on the outskirts of the village. Before entering, Bill looks around to make sure he isn't being followed by any people or vehicles. Satisfied, he enters, and orders a whiskey to calm his nerves, but seconds later, he notices the nightmarish looking stranger shambling inside, and ordering a lemonade. Out of his mind, Bill demands to know who the ghoul is, and why he keeps stalking him. The stranger angrily responds:

Furious, she slams the door on his face again.

On the third day, the same thing happens.

When the husband returns from work at night, she finally tells him what's been happening.

Feeling outraged, he makes a plan:

My love, tomorrow I'm not going to work. If that idiot appears, I hide, you answer, and then I show up and kick his ass.

The next morning, the doorbell rings, and the husband, before hiding, says to his wife:

-If it's him, answer with a yes, just so we know what he has to say.

She answers the door, and there is the same man with the same old question:

-Do you have a vagina?

-Yes, I have.
