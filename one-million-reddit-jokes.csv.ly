The two left with Hitler complaining that he did not understand what the point of this was and Goering telling him to be patient. They went to another shop and Goering gave the same act: “Do you have any left-handed teacups?” The clerk stared and shrugged his shoulders.

They left with Hitler becoming incensed over this nonsense and Goering begging for patience. Finally they went into a Jewish shop; Goering again asked the clerk: “Do you have any left-handed teacups?”

The clerk smiled graciously, went into the back room and made a show of rummaging around, brought out a saucer and teacup, set down the saucer, and carefully placed the cup with the handle pointed so Goering could pick it with his left hand. “There you are, mein herr!” the clerk said.

Goering bought the teacup, thanked the clerk, and the two men left. Goering turned to Hitler and said: “See, I told you the Jews were very clever people.”

“I don’t see what was so clever about that,” Hitler snapped. “He just happened to have one in stock!”","Hitler and Goering were arguing about the Jews, Goering stating that they were quite clever people and Hitler vehemently denying they were any such thing.",6

post,79h8wg,2qh72,jokes,false,1509292736,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/79h8wg/original_la_luz_roja/,self.jokes,,"Drag Racing was my passion. It all started when I was 7 years old. Every night I would hear loud car noises in the streets outside my house. My mother told me to never look outside to see what it was, for it wasn’t the sound of cars, but the sound of monsters ready to kill me. She was obviously lying about the monsters so I decided look instead. I opened my window and saw an empty road. Not a single person, car, or monster for that matter, was present. I was about to go back to sleep when I suddenly heard a faint car engine revving in the distance. The sound grew louder and louder as the seconds passed by, and then as the sound of the engine grew unbearable, a red streak of light quickly flashed along the small portion of the road visible to me. 

La Luz Roja, translation: “The Red Light”. He was the best drag racer in all of Spain. My uncle, who was also a very talented drag racer, told me that not even God could beat him in a drag race. The weird thing about La Luz Roja is that no one has ever seen his face. His car, a severely modified Chevrolet Camaro, was heavily tinted. Even if he left his car, he always wore a racing helmet. He never talked to the other racers, he was just there to win. Some even think he was a robot, maybe even an alien, but to me, he was my inspiration.

I secretly snuck out my room every Friday night to watch the drag races up close. Whenever La Luz Roja was driving, it didn’t seem to be a race, since he was literally 2 miles ahead of the others. It took a full minute just to see where the other racers were. The road was 8 miles long, and was more or less straight until the end. At the starting point was a clocktower. The racers gather at 11:30 pm and the race starts at 12 midnight sharp. One night, my uncle let me inside his car during one of the races.

“Don’t tell your mother, okay?” He said.

The clock struck 12 and a man on top of the clocktower shot a starter pistol. We were off. The sound of tires screeching along the pavement was almost deafening for the first two seconds. I was pushed back by the intense G-forces as we were accelerating from 0 to 80 in less than 4 seconds. I asked my uncle: “Where’s La Luz Roja?”. My uncle didn’t speak, but instead pointed to a red dot in front of the road. We were already at 115 miles per hour at this point, but he was still leading by a wide margin.

Eleven years passed and I was finally able to drive. Since my uncle retired from drag racing two years prior, I inherited his car. His car was a DeLorean DMC-12 with a few modifications. He was a big Back to the Future fan, so my family wasn’t surprised when he bought it back in 1985. On a good day, it can top 130 miles per hour, which would normally beat 80-90% of the other drag racers who were competing. I took it for a test run one night, I wanted to feel out the car first before actually competing. On my way back home, I stopped at the 2nd out of 3 intersections leading to my house since the stoplight was on red. No one was crossing the intersections but I still stopped since I wasn’t in a rush anyway. I then heard a loud but familiar noise in the distance. I looked back but saw nothing, even when the sound grew louder and louder. The sound was of an engine, a big one for that matter. The sound got so loud that I had to cover my ears to prevent irreparable damage, even then, no car in sight. There was a man outside my car jumping and shouting at me, I wasn’t able to hear what he was saying because of the sound, but I was able to figure out what he said by reading his lips, “La Luz Roja”. The stop light turned green when suddenly everything in my field of view became red. I was blinded by the red light for a second then it all disappeared along with the sound. I got home five minutes later and parked the DeLorean inside my garage. I entered my house and saw my uncle eating with my parents. It was unusual since my uncle never visits my mom and dad.

“How’s the car?” My uncle asked.

“I think I just saw La Luz Roja.” I answered.

“La Luz Roja?” My dad asked as he angrily stood up, “You mean ‘The Red Light’? You’ve been drag racing, Pablo?”

“No I haven’t, I just took the DeLorean for a spin.”

“You really saw La Luz Roja?” My uncle asked. “How’d it feel?”

“Well, I technically didn’t see him, all I saw was a flash of red light.”

My uncle looked startled.

“So he’s finally done it, eh?” He asked himself.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“A year ago, he modified his Camaro even further and equipped it with a 2036 StarDrive model.”

“A what?”

“It basically makes you go 50-70% the speed of light without damaging nearby objects. It creates a pocket dimension that surrounds the car. Only the rear of the car isn’t surrounded by the pocket dimension, hence the intense redshift you saw.”

“What?” I asked as I didn’t get anything my uncle said.

“He was so fast that the red light you saw wasn’t even him, but his after image.”

“How is that possible?”

“No one knows, but from what I heard, if you manage beat The Red Light in a drag race, he’ll give the StarDrive to you.”

“What would I possibly use it for?”

“The StarDrive can still be modified. There’s a point where it can even transcend time. The StarDrive isn’t man made, Pablo. If it were, it was given to us by ourselves from the future.”

It was suddenly silent. Not a single word came out of my uncle’s mouth after that, he left shortly after as well.

“Go to your room, Pablo.” My dad said, “You have an 8 am class tomorrow.”

I went to my room and lied down on my bed. I couldn’t sleep, the thought of The Red Light kept me up all night. It excites me to see someone that fast.

Time passed by, 10 pm, 11 pm. I quietly snuck out of my room and drove the DeLorean to a local car shop. “How could I beat La Luz Roja if he has a StarDrive?” I asked myself, but then it hit me, I’ll just use the Pocket Dimension the StarDrive generates to my advantage. 

The owner of the local car shop was my friend, his name was Erik. We were high school classmates once but he dropped out to be a drag racer. We talked for 2 hours straight about how I’ll use the StarDrive to my advantage, he told me to get as close as possible to The Red Light’s car before the race starts. He usually turns on his StarDrive immediately after the race starts, so if I get close enough, I might be able to stick to his car.

“It’s risky.” Erik said.

“But if it works, I’ll be known throughout the world.” I said.

“We don’t even know what’s inside that pocket dimension, for all you know it might be 1000 degrees inside and you’ll just end up dying.”

“Or maybe there’s a gravitational field inside it.” I replied, “That would enable me to slingshot past him before we reach the finish line.”

“Your call, Pablo. I don’t wanna see a friend die.”

I got back home and slept. I woke up at 11 am, and apparently, I missed my 8 am class. I didn’t go to school that day since I was preparing for the big race later that night. I went back to Erik and modified the DeLorean so it can withstand high temperatures, much like a space shuttle.

“I honestly don’t think this is going to work, Pablo.” Erik said as he placed and insulation panel on the left door.

“Why not?” I asked.

“A lot of things can go wrong while you’re inside, you might not even come out as Pablo anymore.”

“It’s a risk I’m willing to take, Erik. I’ll pray before the race, don’t worry.”

After installing the panels, I headed to the clocktower and waited for the race to start. I told my parents that I was going to have a sleepover at my friend’s house so they won’t come and try to find me.

I was already lined up at the starting line 10 minutes before 12. I was doing last-minute checks when The Red Light slowly inched to the starting line. His car, the Chevrolet Camaro, was silent. It didn’t make any noise even when the engine was turned on. The clocked ticked down, it was almost 12. No one even dared to challenge The Red Light, I was the sole opponent. I tried to move my car an inch away from his Camaro seconds before the clocked hit 12. The crowd outside suddenly chanted: “10, 9, 8, 7…”

It was time. It’s either I beat The Red Light, or I die trying.

“6, 5, 4”

I remembered my friends, my family, if something goes wrong, I won’t be able to see them again.

“3, 2, 1”

But, I just have to live my life to the fullest.

“Zero!”

We were off, as expected, he immediately turned on his StarDrive, but little did he know that I was expecting it. Everything suddenly turned white, a high-pitched noise was coming outside, the whole car was shaking, I tried to wave my arms but it appeared that I was moving in slow motion.

Then suddenly, a big boom. Everything went back to normal. The StarDrive was turned off. I looked over The Red Light’s car to see his StarDrive in flames. This is it. I can beat him without his StarDrive. I quickly accelerated to the modified DeLorean’s top speed of 210 miles per hour. I can see his car being left behind. His Camaro was obviously damaged so I took advantage of it. I sped through one…, two intersections, but then this policeman ran up in front of my car and told me to stop. As a law-abiding citizen I slammed the brakes, and luckily, I wasn’t able to hit him. While I was still, La Luz Roja sped past by me. I rolled down my windows and talked to the policeman.

“What seems to be the problem officer?” I asked.

He pointed to the stoplights I passed and said, “Didn’t you see that you were beating the red light?”

The young gunfighter goes up to the old-timer and says, ""If you're Drango Dune, I've rid all the way out here to call you down!"", and Dune says, ""Whatever for?""  

""They say you're the greatest gunfighter there ever was,"" says the youngster, ""so after I beat you, I'll be the greatest.""  The old-timer laughs softly, and says, ""I guess you had your ride for nothing, then. I don't do that stuff no more.""  

""But you're the greatest!"" says the youngster. ""There's stories and songs and everything!""  

""Was the greatest, was the greatest,"" says Drango. ""Son, all those songs and stories are... well, they must be forty years old. Still... if you've rid all this way then it's a real shame to see it go for nothing. I guess I could give you a few tips at least. Why'n't you show me the best you got?""  

The youngster draws and shoots in a blur of motion, and knocks the candle out of its stick just to the left of the piano player, who carries on playing with never a pause; and Drango Dune nods sagely and says, ""Pretty good. Mind you, there's room for improvement. You want to let out the strap on that holster just one-half an inch, so your gun ride a mite lower. You'll shave off maybe a fifth of a second that way.""  

The youngster does as he says and does an even faster draw, and knocks the candle out of its stick just to the right of the piano player, who carries on playing with never a pause; and Drango Dune nods once again and says, ""Real good. Now, just rub off the checking on the spur of that hammer, and you'll take another tenth of a second off that draw.""  

Again the youngster does as he's told and draws and shoots the hat off the head of the piano player, who carries on playing with never a pause; and Drango Dune nods and says, ""Just one thing more. Take that gun of yours and, you see that barrel of bear grease at the end of the bar? Dip your gun in there and get a real good coating on it.""  

The youngster comes back with his well-greased gun and says, ""And the grease will make my draw even quicker, right?""  

Drango Dune shakes his head and says, ""Oh no, son. It's just that when Wyatt Earp gets done playing the piano, he's gonna come over here and stick that gun of yours where the sun doesn't shine; and this way, it won't hurt as much.""",The tale of Drango Dune,222

Jake says to Mabel, “Gee I really wish we could ride that helicopter,” clearly interested in the ride. 

Mabel replies, “Well it’s expensive Jake. 50 bucks is 50 bucks.”

Many years pass by, and Jake is nearing 75 years old. He and Mabel go to the fair as they usually do, and Jake asks, “Mabel, after all these years I still haven’t gotten to ride on the helicopter. Why can’t we go this year, it may be one of the last times we come.”

Mabel once again replies, “50 bucks is 50 bucks.”

Jake sighs and continues walking, until the pilot of the helicopter calls out to them. “Hey, if you two can stay completely silent for the entire flight, I’ll let you ride for free. However, if you say a word, it’s 50 bucks.”

Jake’s eyes widen, and Mabel agrees to finally ride the helicopter. The pilot starts giving them the ride, going in circles and flying around the place. They finally land after an hour, and the pilot asks, “Wow, how’d you manage to keep quiet for the entire flight? I guess you got yourself a free ride.”

""I'll have the same,"" says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order. ""That will be $18.40 please."" The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, ""A hamburger, fries, and a coke.""

The ostrich says, ""I'll have the same.""

Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, ""The usual?""

""No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad"", says the guy.

""Me too,"" says the ostrich.

The waitress brings the order and says, ""That will be $42.62.""

Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. ""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?""

""Well,"" says the guy, ""several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

""That's brilliant!"" says the waitress. ""Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!""

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,"" says the guy.

The waitress asks, ""But, sir, what's with the ostrich?""

""Well there is... just one. It might not be the best but she goes for $1.25.""

Mid way through, he notices that that a white liquid began seeping from her eyes, nose, and mouth, trickling into a small puddle on the sheets.

He walked for as long as he could, but the rain became too much to bear. He found a tree and stood beneath it, waiting for a car.   
Hours went by, and he was beginning to give up hope. It was a quiet road indeed that he found him on. The next town wasn’t for miles, so he’d have to stay the night under this tree if he didn’t find a ride.  
Just as things were looking grim, he catches a light moving slowly towards him. He’s saved!  
Desperate for a ride, he jumps into the vehicle once it stops for him. Once in, he turned to the driver seat to say thanks, and only then did he realize then moving car had no driver. The rain was so heavy, he couldn’t even hear the sound of the engine as the car slowly continued it’s journey.   
The lad was too scared to move, too afraid to jump out of the car and run. Seeing the car was coming to a sharp bend that lead down to dark water, he began to pray for his life. He was sure the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, where he would surely drown!     
Right before the car made it to the bend, a shadowy hand reached in through the driver side window and turned the wheel, guiding the car around the bend, thus avoiding a wet demise for the lad. Just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again.  
Paralyzed with fear, the lad watched the hand reappear every time they reached a bend. Finally, scared to near death, he’d had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran towards the first town he could find.   
Wet and in shock, he went into the nearest bar and told everybody about his supernatural experience. A silence enveloped the room and everybody got goosebumps when they realized the guy was telling the truth about the stange car and the ghostly hand that guided it on its way.  
Just then, two men walked into the bar. They were dripping wet and as they took off their rain gear, they looked around the room. Their eyes came to rest on the hitchhiker. They pointed at him ominously, and he feared they were ghosts come to get him.   
“Look!” said one of the men, “There’s the idiot who jumped into our car when we were pushing it in the rain.”","A lad was on his way to visit his friend. Whilst driving, his car broke down and it began to rain so heavily, he couldn’t see his own hands in front of him. (Halloween super scary story)",141

They grab their bedsheets and tie them end-to-end to make a rope. Soon, though, they realize that they're on the top floor, and that they wouldn't have enough rope to climb down to the ground. Then, one of them gets an idea. He says ""Hey, I know, what if we sling this rope up to the roof and climb up there? There's bound to be a fire escape or something.""

The other guy likes the idea, so they do it. They break off the wooden legs of their beds, sharpen them against the wall, and tie those together with pillowcases, forming a grappling hook. They flick the rope up to the roof and *bing*, it holds.

One by one, they climb up to the roof and look around. There is no fire escape on the asylum, but there is one on the building next door. There's a 10 foot gap between the roofs, but the other building is shorter, so it's not impossible to leap there. The first guy decides to take his chances and jumps the gap. He lands right on the edge, barely pulling himself up.

""Your turn!"" he shouts.

""No way! I can't jump that far! Let me think of something else.""

He looks around for a solution, but there is none. Then, the first guy has an idea.

""Hey,"" he says, ""I know! I have this old flashlight from when I first got committed. The battery is a little weak, but it'll work just fine. I'll shine the light across the gap, and you can just walk along the beam, no problem.""

He arrived at a rather run down looking brothel and went inside and told the madam that all he had was 25 cents and he would take whatever they could give him for that. The madam informs him that there is a lady on the top floor that he can see for that but warns him that he might want to pass because she is absolutely disgusting. Against the advice of the madam the sailor decides to go for it anyway.

He goes upstairs and realizes the madam was totally right about her but since he didn't know when the next time he would be at a port would be he went ahead and did the deed.

After they are finished he is putting on his clothes and asks where his other 25 cents is. The prostitute picks it up off the night stand and says ""Oh you mean this?"" and proceeds to shove it way up inside herself and says ""You're going to have to eat me out to get it"". So the sailor closes his eyes and dives right in hoping to get this over with as quickly as possible. 

When he finds it he grabs it with his teeth and yanks it out of there and runs to the bus stop so he can make it back to his ship in time. When he gets on the bus he spits the coin into the tray and sits down. A few minutes pass and the bus still isn't moving.

So they came upon a bunch of natives. These natives were mean looking with knives, clubs and spears. They looked like stereotypical cannibals. The natives grabbed them and brought them to their chief.

The chief told them that they have two options. He asked them, DigDug or death? 
Death he motioned sweeping the neck.

So the assistant was a family man and had kids and stuff so he said he wants DigDug.  Death was final and not an option for him and he wanted to see his kids again.

So the chief motions to his subordinates and they grab the assistant. Stripped him naked and tied him ass up onto a frame. Like his body formed a number 7. 

The chief then clapped his hands and 50 small sized men formed a line.  They then each took twenty minutes and fucked him in the ass. At the end of it all the assistant could not walk. So the chief motioned and they let him go free.

Now the explorer seeing what happened to his assistant decided fuck that. I would rather choose death. 

So when the chief asked him, he chose death rather than go through what the assistant just went through.  The chief asked him again and again the explorer chose death rather than go through what the assistant went through. 

The chief clapped his hands again.

And once again they stripped him and put him on the frame. Then the biggest cannibal with the hugest sword came up.  Raised his sword!

So he writes this gents number down and puts it off to the side. some time passes (days/weeks) and the gent is having a bad day so he picks up the phone and dials that number and just screams at the man after he's picked up then after a good yelling hang up the phone. This goes on for awhile on the bad days the customer service gent has. Soon it becomes a habit and the man on the other end explains he is going to find him and kick his ass. Eventually he deals with yet another angry customer. Writes down the number, and places it next to the other. On his next REALLY bad day he picks up the new number gives it a call and gives the man a good yelling and hangs up. This guy calls him back. He yells and curses again and hangs up. Then picks up the original number and gives him a call. On the other end the gent immediately begins to tell him how hes going to kick his ass when he finds out who it is. so the customer service gent works him up a bit and says he'll meet him to kick HIS ass. They both agree and a spot to meet is determined. The Customer Service gent hangs up and leans back in his chair. Leans forward again and picks up the phone and dials the other number. Just like before the line is answered and immediately met with harsh words of an ass kicking. He tells him to come kick his ass and to meet him at a certain spot at a certain time. He agrees and they both hang up. Customer Service Gent gets off work early, goes home grabs a cooler and fills it with beer, grabs a lawn chair and throws it in the back of his truck and gets in the car. he drives to a hill and places the lawn chair next to the cooler and pops a cold one. There he waits for his two unsuspecting entertainment. He sits and watches these two angry men beat the living shit out of each other . FiN!

One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Easy mistake!! Haha !,26

The private and the young lady exchange glances much to the chagrin of her father.

A voice from the hall announces that they are approaching a tunnel. The young private winks at the lady who giggles.

Moments after they enter the tunnel two sounds are heard in the compartment...

*SMOOOOOOCH!!!!*

And then a second later...

*SLAP!*

The train leaves the tunnel and everything is normal in the compartment, but each passenger is thinking the following:

Father: Insolent boy kissing my daughter like that! I'm glad she slapped him so hard!

Young lady: Oh that kiss was so sweet! I wish my father hadn't hit him so hard!

Officer: Haha, oh good for the young boy to get a little kiss. I just wish her father hadn't hit me by accident in the darkness!

Private: Best. Day. Ever. I got to kiss a beautiful lady and I got to slap my commanding officer and get away with it!

While others built their shelters out of sticks, they built their shelters out of adobe bricks. While others cooked with fire pits, they cooked with electric stoves. While others fought with swords, they fought with guns. However, there was one thing the spanish civilization had that they themselves even saw as magic. It was no surprise that they already invented cameras; however, to get a camera, one must go to the photography shop. This place was special though. Whenever someone visited, weird things would happen to people. These weird things included visitors growing extra arms, getting their whole body turned to a different color, or even getting their head replaced with that of a giraffe. One day, a sailor visited this village after hearing all the rumours of magic. Perplexed by what he saw, he ran up to the closest person he saw, a transparent human with eagle wings and toaster ovens coming out his arms.

“Why does everyone look so weird?” Asked the sailor.

He worked late that night, and the sun had already fallen below the sky. The man enjoyed the two mile walk to work in the morning, but the cold of the night made the way back numb, rigid, and surreal. The man followed long, curving roads through the dark pine forests, illuminated by cold sunlight reflected off the moon. He had a lot on his mind, since he was not only recently married, but he had a four year old daughter to take care of.

The thought of not being able to provide for his toddler weighted down his head, and his eyes stayed focused on the ground. Though his mind drifted between thoughts and worries, the cold kept his body rigid and alert. The ethereal night seemed to not even faze the young man, content on going home. He was far enough away from town now to see the stars, but he'd never get far enough away to see the explosive beauty of the unpolluted night sky.

At last he arrived at his home. Though his mind remained inactive, his body reached into his suede jacket and removed the keys within, turning the lock without issue. He stumbled inside, leaving his shoes and his mind by the door. His hands curled around his neck and tugged on his red tie until it came loose, and then they loosed their grip until it fell to the ground. His body dropped into bed, and his mind joined it, without even worrying about bathing. The heat of his loved one warmed his frozen muscles, and he fell joyously into the arms of sleep.

He emerged from rest at 10 o clock AM. It was a Saturday now. The young man, reinvigorated, quickly bathed and put on new clothes. The heat of the water nearly lulled him back to sleep, but the sudden rush of cold he experienced after his shower brought him back out. The nervous young man carried his lazy bones into the kitchen, where they were greeted by the aroma of pancakes and bacon. His love, bless her soul, had prepared breakfast for them. The whole family gathered around the table and enjoyed a meal. At one point, the young girl noticed her father's glass was empty.

Since he was an elder in a modern community he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.
Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the tribe should collect firewood to be prepared.
But being a practical leader, after several days he had an idea.

He walked out to the telephone booth on the highway, called the Bureau of Meteorology and asked, 'Is the coming winter in this area going to be cold?'
The meteorologist responded, 'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold.'
So the elder went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later he called the Bureau of Meteorology again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?'
The meteorologist again replied, 'Yes, it's going to be a very cold winter.'
The elder again went back to his community and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later the elder called the Bureau again. 'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' he asked.
'Absolutely,' the man replied. 'It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'
'How can you be so sure?' the elder asked.
The weatherman replied, 'Our satellites have reported that the Aboriginals in the north are collecting firewood like crazy, and that's always a sure sign.",Weather forecasts in Australia,9
