""Come in,"" says the podiatrist, ""What's the problem?""

The moth drops down into the nearest chair and says ""What's the problem? I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""

The doctor stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?""

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.

The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""

The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in Australia and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in North Cowra. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule'.""

The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?""

The Farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up.""

The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees!

His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie.

Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very

slowly managed to get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, ""Okay, you old fart. Now it's my turn.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.""

Everyone on the boat dies except these 3 men who miraculously manage to swim a mile to a nearby forested island. The lucky survivors soon pass out on the beach from exhaustion. When they wake up, to their horror, they discover they have been taken prisoner by a native tribe and sentenced to death for trespassing on their territory. The chieftain feeling merciful, offers to grant each of the mens' last requests provided it was within their power.

After a long time spent thinking, the first man wishes to taste the finest wine on the island. As the natives prepare their best drink, the chief approaches the first man and lightly pulls his skin exclaiming ""Ah, your skin will make for a great canoe!"". The wine is soon completed. After finishing his drink, the natives quickly cut him open and use his skin to waterproof a canoe.

The Chief then approaches the second man and asks him for his last request. After yet another long time spent thinking, he comes to terms with his fate and wishes for a swift death. Before commencing with his wish, the Chief inspects the prisoner and also exclaims: ""Ah! You too will make for a fine canoe!"". The second man is quickly killed and cut open for yet another canoe.

The third man after witnessing the murders of his 2 companions spends much longer than the first 2 in considering his final wish. The Chief returns at the end of the day saying his time is up and he must decide or they would kill him immediately. 

After a moment more of consideration he states ""I want a fork.""

The chief was baffled but ordered his men to grant the man his wish anyways. The natives soon returned with the man's requested fork and then left to sharpen their knives. As the Chief returns to the man's cell he finds his guards attempting to restrain the prisoner who is now repeatedly stabbing himself with the fork and screaming:

""Nobody's making a canoe out of me!"".

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.

Well Roy was so mad he was fit to spit. He went inside and grabbed his hunting rifle and whistled for his dog Bullet. He and Bullet jumped in the ranch jeep and headed up into the hills to hunt down that no-good puma.
Well after tramping around for a bit Bullet picked up the mountain lion's scent and before you knew it Roy had him in his sights. Well one quick shot later the dead cat was tied across the hood of the Jeep and Roy headed back down to the ranch.

The tiger hears the dogs monologue and decides to return to its cave nearby in fear that the dogs words might actually become true.

A monkey was sitting on a tree, and was spectating the whole scenery, meaning that it undertood the dogs trick, so it decides to go inside the tigers lair and tell it the truth in exchange for some free food.

The clever dog though, being aware of the monkeys presence, decides to follow it, resulting the dog to hear the monkey-tigers dialogue.

A few hours later the tiger rushes in the jungle in hopes of finding the dog. The tiger finds the clever dog (which was pretending that didnt see the tiger) and it was about to strike when the dog all of a sudden says 

""Where the hell is this monkey?! I told it to bring me a tiger and it didnt lure in a single one!!!""

The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench. Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis.

 

The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment.

 

He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white, patriarchal society.

 

'In fact', he pointed out, 'some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary  society'.

 

After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, 'Would you like to know what the painting is really about?'

 

'Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery, asked the couple?

There was this guy and he had a girlfriend named
Lorraine who was very pretty and he liked her a lot.

One day he went to work and found that a new girl had started working there. Her name was Kleerly and she was absolutely gorgeous.

He became quite besotted with Kleerly and after a
while it became obvious that she was interested in him too.

But this guy was a loyal man and he wouldn't do
anything with Kleerly while he was still going out with Lorraine.

He decided that there was nothing left to do but to break up with Lorraine and continue with the Kleerly.

couldn't bring himself to do it.

Surprised, he doesn't understand and think it's because he is too tired.

""Everyday and night I hear that voice in my head that repeats the same thing, I don't know what to do"".

The doctor gives him some medicine and tells him that it's gonna be fine.

DO IT, THIS IS YOUR LIFE, DO IT"".

The man is really tired after 6 months of hearing the voice, and he begins to think that after all, this is maybe a sign, his destiny. So he goes to his job, see his boss and quit. He goes to a real estate agent, and sell everything he has in his appartment.

He books a plane ticket to vegas, and goes there only with his suit and his suitcase full of cash.

Arriving there, he hears the voice saying ""Go to royal road and enter the royal casino"". He did.

At the top is the realm of the complete, perfect Cheerios. These Cheerios live a life of luxury, with as much food and drink as they want, and little work to do. The second level of the box, the middle layer, is occupied by the imperfect but still mostly whole. These Cheerios have to work to survive, but life is manageable. The lowest level is occupied by the broken, destroyed fragments of Cheerios, that small children refuse to eat, and it is these Cheerios that must fight to survive in the dog-eat-dog world of the lower box.

The protagonist of our story is a Cheerio crumb from the lower box. For the sake of the story, this Cheerio's name is Jake. Jake had been born in the lower box, but had heard stories of the immense wealth of the Cheerios in the top layer. Being a naive young lad, Jake did not understand why he couldn't live up with the whole Cheerios. He dreamed of eating hamburgers and drinking lemonade, of laying around in the sun, He was determined to make it to the top. So one day, he began to climb.

Jake didn't tell his mother where he was going. He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.

""Who the f**k are you?"" asked a big Cheerio in the shape of a 'C'

""I'm Jake. and I want to reach the top of the box.' our hero replied earnestly.

""Well, sorry mate, you're not going to"" apologised the big Cheerio as he picked up Jake by the collar and threw him back down into the lower section.

Jake fell far, and fell hard. He woke up on the very bottom of the box, and realised that he still wanted to get to the  top.  He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.

""You again?"" asked the big Cheerio.

""I really. really want to get to the top"" Jake retorted breathlessly.

""Well, if  you really want to get there, how about you stay with me to get your strength back?""  the bigger Cheerio offered.

""I'll take you up on that,"" Jake said graciously

The bug Cheerio's name was Kevin, and he was a nice guy. He didn't mind the lower downs, and he didn't begrudge the top dwellers their existence. In the morning Jake bid Kevin farewell and began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the top layer of the box.

""What on earth is a Plebeian like you doing here?"" asked a gloriously perfect Cheerio.

""I'm Jake. and I want to reach the top of the box.' our hero replied earnestly.

""Well, tough luck, you're not going to"" said the complete Cheerio as he picked up Jake by the collar and threw him back down into the abyss below.

Jake fell very far, and fell  very hard. He woke up on the very bottom of the box, and realised that he still wanted to get to the  top.  He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.

""You have a lot of determination for a young one,"" Kevin observed ""Come on, you can stay with me until you don't look like you've been hit by a train""

Kevin's wife's name was Kay, and she was a bitch. She hated the lower downs, and worshipped the top dwellers. In the morning Jake bid Kevin farewell (after sh*ting in Kay's car)  and began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the top layer of the box.

""How on earth did you survive that fall?"" asked the pompous Cheerio.

""It's only about 20 centimetres"" Jake told him.

""True- but to climb all the way back here after... you must be made of special stuff."" The complete Cheerio turned around and picked up a card. ""This is a visitors card. It allows you to stay up here for a day, and you are allowed to have one drink and one item of food. However, you must leave and never return once this day has finished"".

Jake accepted, and set out to explore the top layer. It was everything he'd dreamed and more. They had streets of gold and fields of green. Kittens and puppies played everywhere. Jake happily explored the area until lunchtime, when he decided he wanted to get his food and drink. He approached the hamburger restraunt, but saw that the line went out the door. He decided to get a drink first.

Jake walked over to the lemonade stand, but was shocked to discover that the line was several hundred metres long. He realised he did not have enough time to wait in this line, so he decided to find a different drink. He walked up to one of the Cheerios in the lemonade line.

""Excuse me sir,"" Jake said nervously.

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do
not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
two, if you drank enough of it.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack
Samson.

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets
wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
You've been changed.

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
you.""

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
have to kill me?""

""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
fluid, and just denature it?""

""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the
second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
staring at him.

""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
request to me.""

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

""That takes two requests, Jack.""

""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you
accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
just start talking?""

""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""

""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,""
answered Nate.

""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up.
""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
No thanks. Just talk.""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start
looking at me as food.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack.""

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least.""

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know.""

""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious
again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with
his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it
to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his
shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?""

""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
Like he had a lot to think about.""

""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

So, they decide to go on a trip to an island in the Caribbean as their goodbye trip.  One of them is going to Penn state, the second is going to Yale, and the last is going to Texas state.  


They get on the plane, and are flying to the island when all of a sudden the plane starts having issues, and crashes.  The three friends are the only survivors.  They end up on some random island on the way there with no one else.

The friends start to explore the island, and find some ruins on the island.  At the front of the ruins there is a sign in hieroglyphics.  The friend that is going to Penn can read them, and it says ""once a year, one person can go in to collect the riches"".  So he decides, ""alright, since I read it, ill go in first"".  So he goes in, and he's in there collecting the riches, But when he turns around he sees green smoke coming towards him, so he gets out of there.

A year later they are still on the island,  and it is the Yale friends turn to go into the ruins and collect the riches.  So he goes in, and he's collecting the riches, just like the other guy.  But, when he turns around he sees blue smoke, so he gets out of there. 

A whole year later they are still on the island, and it is the last friends turn to go in,  So the Texas state friend goes in and he is collecting the riches.  But his story is a little different, when he turns around he doesn't see smoke.  He sees a black coffin, so he runs out of there.


NOW they are back home and it's been a year since the first friend went into the ruins. He's driving along, enjoying his day, then he sees green smoke.  Never seen again.

A year after that the friend that is at Yale is just having a party and such, then he sees blue smoke.  Never seen again, dies at the age of 19.

The last and final friend is sitting in his bed a year after that wondering ""They both died, year after year on the exact days, it's my turn""  He rolls over in bed, knowing it's gonna be there.

Now,  as she's lying there not wanting to crawl from under the covers, he gets ready and rushes out of the house. She starts to wonder,  ""do I really have a big vagina? I've always assumed it was normal sized.""  
She then decides to try to not dwell on it and goes to wake up the children. 
One by one the kids are awake and dressed, and she prepares their lunches for them,  hurrying them off to the bus stop. 
She goes back into the house to get ready and run and pay bills and other errands. 
Most st of the day she has been trying to ignore the statement her husband had made, but over the course of the day it starts gnawing at her. She decides that she will investigate this matter when she gets home. 
The woman makes a stop by a store and pics up one of those long rectangular wall hanging mirrors. 
Not realizing the time of the day and noticing it's close to the time the youngest child's bus arrives at home she speeds home and frantically runs upstairs with the mirror. 
She strips naked and is standing over the mirror lying on the floor. Closely examining her body.  In all of her anxiousness she doesn't hear the front door open and the footsteps on the staircase,  and all of the sudden she hears a small voice cry out,  ""whoa mom! Look out for that big hole in the floor!""",A man and woman are lying in bed in the early morning before the kids are awake.,1

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Bubba how about Tom Cruise?""

""Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Bubba and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and sure enough, Tom Cruise, shouts, ""Bubba! Great to see you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!""

Although impressed, Bubba's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Bubba that he thinks Bubba's knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Bubba says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yes,"" Bubba says, ""I know him, let's fly out to Washington.""
And off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Bubba on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Bubba, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a cup of coffee first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now, but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White house grounds, he expresses his doubts to Bubba, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""The Pope,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Bubba.

""My folks are from Argentina, and I've known the Pope a long time.""

So off they fly to Rome. Bubba and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Bubba says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""

And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Bubba emerges with the Pope on the balcony. But by the time Bubba returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Working his way to his boss' side, Bubba asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, ""Who's that on the balcony with Bubba?""


TL;DR: Bubba proves to his boss that he knows everyone. His boss faints when someone in Vatican City knows the Bubba, but not the Pope.

post,3gjdci,2qh72,jokes,false,1439256713,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3gjdci/the_tale_of_three_friends/,self.jokes,,"There were once three friends who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight. In time, the friends reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across.. However, these friends were learned in the magical arts, and so the first friend waved his broken wand and made a potato. You see, that friend was kind of stupid. So the nerdy girl, after correcting her friend on the good way cast the spell, took out her wand with attitude and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three friends upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.


So the Ginger, who was a stupid man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the fool.


Then the second friend, who was as arrogant as his father, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the friend with messy hair, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.


And then Death asked the third and cleverest friend what he would like. The smart ass girl was the humblest and also the wisest of the friends, and she did not trust Death. So she asked for something that would enable her to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

Then Death stood aside and allowed the three friends to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts. In due course the friends separated, each for his own destination.

The first one traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the first friend proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.

That very night, another wizard crept upon the first friend as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The theif took the wand and, for good measure, slit the ginger's throat.

And so Death took the first friend for his own.

Meanwhile, the second one journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of his parents he wanted to know, before their untimely death, appeared at once before him.

Yet they were sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though they had returned to the mortal world, they did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second friend, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join them.

And so Death took the second friend for his own.

But though Death searched for the third friend for many years, he was never able to find her. You could think that Death couldn't see the muggle-born because of her magic Cloak, but why couldn't he hear her?

That's when Death himself learned, that he was deaf.

Nobody actually new the French kid's name, but he was strange enough for people to make up their own. Creep, Emo, Lame-ass, Weirdo, and plenty of other (and much worse) names. As an extremely goth kid, he had the full goth getup. Black hair, eyeliner, weird piercings, ripped jeans, you get the picture. But what really made him stand out was this really big chain he wore everywhere. Always. It was his favorite accessory. And this kid really, I mean REALLY hated John. The goth kid fancied himself pretty smart, and thought he was much cooler than he really was. So he was really pissed when John became the class valedictorian. He needed some way to prove to the world that he was better than John. He began bragging to everyone about his parent's land back home in France, hoping to make John jealous. Now John wasn't really sure why, but the idea of a weird goth nobody trying to one-up him really got him mad. He needed some way to prove that he was, in fact, better than the goth kid. He did some research into his family tree to see if he was related to anyone famous, to prove that he was inherently better than the French goth. He struck gold! He discovered that he was the long-lost heir to some obscure duke or duchess in, of all places, France! John brought his proof that he was French royalty to school to show the goth kid how much better he was. Of course, the French kid called bull. John wouldn't take it and started claiming that the goth kid was making up all of his family's fortune. He went on a rant, trying to shame the goth kid by saying how he was just jealous that John had become valedictorian, and not him. This continued for weeks, and at the end of it all, they were both livid. They finally decided there was only way to solve this dispute. They would both go to France and prove their wealth to the other. They convinced their families to vacation there at the same time, and it actually worked! Even more weeks later, they were in the airport, going through security (separately, with their respective families). However, the goth kid had forgot how strict the TSA was, and had (as always) been wearing his favorite chain. He was forced to hand it over to airport security, who said he could get it back upon his return. It was a heart-wrenching experience for the kid, who was never without his trademark chain. But he had no choice but to hand it over. Upon arriving in France, he immediately sought out and bought the first chain he could find, much smaller and much more lackluster than his favorite. But he decided it would have to work for now. Although they couldn't yet meet face to face, he finally managed to coordinate a meeting with John over the phone, and they set off to show off their land to each other. The whole time, John was calling the goth kid all sorts of terrible names, partially due to his insecurity about the size of his land. If it was smaller than a lame goth kids, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. However, what both of the kids failed to realize was that John's dead ancestor lived on the property right next to the French kid's! They were finally about to meet, and got to thoroughly examine and compare their family's land beforehand. They set eyes on each other and calmly approached, determined at the last minute to settle this like civilized humans...

One day, the princess's favourite necklace went missing. The king was outraged, as he himself had given the necklace to his daughter for her birthday. He called the ten knights into his throne room and told them that they each had to come up with a theory as to where the jewels had gone, or he would have them beheaded.

""Ser One!"" he roared after a minute. ""What do you think happened to the necklace?"" The first knight was caught off guard. He stammered and stuttered for a moment and finally came up with something. 

""Well, my liege, perhaps... perhaps a masked bandit snuck into her room, took the necklace, and ran off, never to be seen again!""

The king scoffed. ""Preposterous! Her guards would catch such a man. An answer is an answer, though, so your head is safe for now."" 

Sir One sighed in relief. 

""Sir Two!"" the king demanded. ""What do you think?""

The second knight had had more time to think than Sir One, and he had hatched a cunning plan. ""I believe – nay, I am *certain* that one of those very guards took her necklace while she slept!"" he declared, for Sir Two held a grudge against the princess's guards. The king nodded and said that he would consider this possibility.

The king continued in this fashion, questioning each knight in order. After Sir Two's utter confidence, the knights all behaved as though they were completely sure of their answers, even if they were just trying to save their heads! Little did he know that one of his knights had, in fact, told him the truth... but who was it?

...

It was the tenth knight, because he was *Sir Ten!*

Much like the unravelment of the Donald Trump campaign by Stephen Colbert, Windows 10 is supposedly a hilarious joke that no one seems to catch on to. The statement Microsoft will be releasing will be in acknowledgment of this joke along with plans for an automatic reset to users' previous OSs that will occur in the near future. ""We thought that people would catch on once they downloaded Windows 10 and started using it,"" remarked Mary Hayswitt, one of Microsoft's software engineers and part of the design team for Windows 10, ""but some people just don't seem to get it. We created a search engine for a PC, gave it a funny name, made whatever you search for open a browser in Internet Explorer (which we also gave a funny new name), and search for what you searched for through our other search engine Bing! Isn't that hilarious!?...I can just imagine the looks on people's faces when they click on the 'start' menu only to find a bunch of tiles."" She admitted that the creation of Windows 10 was partially designed to force its users into not using anything Google related out of spite. When asked about the limited features of Windows 10 that even Windows 8 and 8.1 users found convenient she responded, ""Well it's not a complete OS. The control panel is only 50% of what it used to be, so we didn't include many customization options or the ability to not automatically install updates. We wouldn't make a complete OS just for a joke."" In fact, upon further discussion, it was revealed that the option to not automatically install updates was intentionally removed from Windows 10 for the *Joke Repairment Program (JRP)* which will be automatically downloaded to desktops running Windows 10 that will restore each system to its former OS. ""It wasn't just that we were bored,"" Hayswitt said about the purpose of Windows 10, ""We wanted to give our customers a good laugh, but at the same time I think it serves another purpose. Since most people took it seriously, Windows 10 makes previous Windows OSs shine like never before. Maybe once the JRP is all said and done, people will look at their old operating systems in a new light and appreciate the little features and functions they took for granted.""",[Satire] Windows 10 Update,1

""You have to be a monk to find out.""
After hearing this all morning he decides to ask the monks how he can become one of them. The head of the monastery says that he has to count all the grains of sand in the world and then he will be allowed to become a monk.
Being a dedicated man he decides to accept the challenge and spent the next 25 years of his life counting all the grains of sand on the Earth. He returns to the monastery and gives the head of the monastery the answer. The head then accepts him into the monastery and tells him where he can find the source of the noise.
 The man reaches a set of wooden doors, he proceeds to open them and walk through. He can hear the noise getting louder as he advances through a set of bronze and then silver doors. Finally he reaches a set of pure gold doors, he opens them and finds out what the noise was.

and it went into their neighbor’s open window and there was a sound of breaking glass from inside.


Nobody came out and there was no sign of the neighbor, so the couple thought they would sneak in and recover the ball, and replace whatever was broken.
 
When they went in, it was all dark, and nobody was home. As they went in the room where the ball fell, they saw a broken glass bottle on the floor and a very hideous and strange looking man sitting in chair.


Before the wife could scream, 
The man said..  “Thank you so very much!! I am a genie and I have been trapped in this bottle for over a thousand years. I am in your debt for freeing me."" 

""Now normally it is my duty to grant three wishes; however since you freed me unintentionally, I will grant you one wish each and the third I will keep for myself.” 

The couple was overjoyed! And couldn’t believe their luck! 

The man went first. “I’d like 10 Million dollars to be deposited in my bank account every month till the day I die.” He said.

“Your wish has been granted!” declared the genie.

The woman said “I’d like a mansion on the most picturesque location in every country of the world!” 

“Done!” claimed the genie.

“And now for my own wish” the genie said. “I haven’t made love to a beautiful woman in over a thousand years and I’d like to have sex with this woman right now” 

The husband and wife looked at each other and decided that it was a small price to pay for all the gifts that the genie has given them, so the genie took the wife to bedroom and had loud passionate sex with her for at least a couple of hours while the husband waited outside..

When they were finished the genie said to the exhausted woman “you two seem rather well educated”

The woman said “Yes, actually we are. My husband is an engineer and I’m a doctor.”

The genie said “An engineer and a doctor eh…. Don’t you think you are bit old to still believe in genies and fairy tales?!?”

'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'

'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'

After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'

'Leave everything to me.. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'

'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'

'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'

'My, that's a lot!' gasped Mrs. Smith.

'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'

'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.

'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with..'

'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.

'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.'

'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

'Yes,' the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh...equipment?'

'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'

'Tripod?'

'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'

Mrs. Smith fainted.",Surrogate Father,373

Needless to say, it soon got so cold that the little bird reluctantly started south anyway. As he flew along, the little bird grew cold and ice formed on his wings which caused him to fall to the ground in a barnyard. A cow wandered by and shit on him. This may seem terrible, but it warmed the poor bird and thawed the ice so that the bird began to chirp and sing. A cat wandered by, heard the noise, and dug through the manure until he found the bird and ate him.  The moral of this story is:
 
   1. Being different makes you cold, lonely, and gets you shit on.
 
   2. Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily your enemy.
 
   3. Everyone who digs you out of the shit is not necessarily your friend.
 
   4. If you are warm and happy in a pile of shit, keep your mouth shut.
