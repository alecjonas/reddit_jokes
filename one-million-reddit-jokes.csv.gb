post,ala3ud,2qh72,jokes,false,1548831264,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ala3ud/high_noon/,self.jokes,,"An old west dime novel writer is out looking for a good story when he wanders into a saloon. He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

First joke, it rains heavily on a town and the next day three boys walk down a road. They see mud in a ditch and want to know how deep it goes. They see a pile of bricks on the side walk and they decide to throw the bricks into the mud to see how deep the mud is. The first boy, throws a brick into the air and it lands three feet into the mud. The second boy throws a brick in the air and it lands six feet into the mud. Then the third boy throws another brick into the air and... it doesn’t come down.

Next joke, 
A woman wants to visit her mom on her birthday, however her mother wants her to bring her pet parrot with her. She can’t find a flight which allows parrots. So she decides she will hide her parrot and she decided to pick a no-smoking and no-pet flight. Once the plane was on cruising altitude, the pilot walked down the aisle greeting everyone with a huge cigar in his mouth, the parrot was tucked underneath the woman’s shirt. So when the pilot greeted the woman, the parrot replied. The pilot told the woman pets were not allowed on the plane, so he grabbed the parrot and threw it out the window. The woman replied saying smoking isn’t either, and she grabbed the cigar and threw it off the plane. The pilot stormed off back into the cockpit, then he heard this tapping...

He looked at the window and saw the parrot, and something was in it’s mouth....

the parrot had a brick in his mouth",Two Jokes for ya,2

Unexpectedly all 3 were taken hostage and tied up, each to a separate tree. Surprisingly, there were several tribesmen who spoke some English and it appeared that they were savages of some sort. Their leader came forward and instructed all 3 of the explorers that there were going to be consequences for wandering into their tribes area, but he would give them 2 options. First, you could choose ugga bugga. This consisted of several of the savages coming forward and violently having their way with that person sexually then climaxing on that individuals face and down their throat. Once this act was complete, that person was free to go. The second option was death.

After a long pause the leader of the savages moved over directly in front of the explorer to his far left and asked, ""which option do you choose, death or ugga bugga?"" The explorer instantly thought of his family. His wife, children, everyone who depended upon him at home. After not much consideration he mumbled to the leader, ""ugga bugga"". The leader took a step back, threw his hands in the air and yelled, ""ugga bugga!!!"". What appeared to be a half dozen savages appeared out of thin air and started to rape the explorer. After approximately 30 minutes of anal and oral torture, the savages climaxed all over the explorer then vanished. He was then cut loose and set free.

The leader now moved over to the second explorer from the left. He then asked him the same question, ""death or ugga bugga?"" After watching his good friend being raped it took him a bit longer to latch on to the thought of his family but he did so. ""Ugga bugga"" he mumbled. The leader once again raised his arms high and screamed loud enough to hear the echo for hundreds of yards, ""ugga bugga!!!"" Once again savages appeared out of thin air. This time they doubled in number. A dozen of them sexually assaulted the man as the 3rd explorer closed his eyes and tried to imagine that what's happening to his friend right next to him is some sort of nightmare. After about 45 minutes the savages all finish and again, vanish. The 2nd explorer, barely conscious, is cut loose and set free.

The leader then walks over to the 3rd explorer. This particular explorer isn't married, doesn't have any children, and doesn't have any family still alive. The leader looks at him and asks, ""death or ugga bugga?"" Without hesitation the 3rd explorer says, ""fuck that, I'll take death!"". The leader throws his hands in the air almost immediately and screams, ""death!!!  by ugga bugga!!!""",The 3 explorers,0

Henry was curious and invited them into his office.

 
 
They refused and instead asked that he come out to the parking lot to their car.

 
 
They persuaded him to get into the car, which was about 130 degrees, turned on the air conditioner, and cooled the car off immediately.

 
 
The old man got very excited and invited them back to the office, where he offered them $3 million for the patent.

 
 
The brothers refused, saying they would settle for $2 million, but they wanted the recognition by having a label, 'The Goldberg Air-Conditioner,' on the dashboard of each car in which it was installed.

 
 
Now old man Ford was more than just a little anti-Jewish, and there was no way he was going to put the Goldberg's name on two million Fords.

 
 
They haggled back and forth for about two hours and finally agreed on $4 million and that just their first names would be shown.

 
And so to this day, all Ford air conditioners show --

 
 
Lo, Norm, Hi, and Max -- on the controls.

 
 
 
 
","The four Goldberg brothers, Lowell, Norman, Hiram, and Max, invented and developed the first automobile air-conditioner. On July 17, 1946 , the temperature in Detroit was 97 degrees.",30

After some time they are taken in the night to some kind of tribunal where they are told that all outsiders are regarded as evil demons and will be sentenced to death unless they pass a test that will prove that the universe perceives them as benign entities in which case they will be free to go.

They ask them what this test consists of and they are told that it is very simple. The aliens have what is akin to a set of cards that they explain has been delivered to them by the gods and can be used to determine the fate of any individual in the galaxy. Each card represents a single number, there are an unknown quantity of cards, and it is not known if the numbering is consecutive, or if any number appears more than once or not at all.

The aliens will draw 5 cards face down and then reveal them one at at a time. They ask for one of the prisoners to be a representative and speak for the prisoners. Han steps forward and asks what he must do. They explain all he must do is decide whether there will be more even numbered cards drawn or more odd cards, if he is correct the gods have decided they are not a threat and will all be granted freedom, otherwise they will be considered evil and each each face a gruesome death.

Han looks back at his most trusted friend Luke, who mouths to him that he should choose the even numbers to which Han confidently nods and exclaims to his captures that he chooses the evens.

The cards are drawn and then slowly revealed...

ODD! ... EVEN! .... ODD! ........... EVEN!.....

It feels like an eternity while the final card is being turned ...

After some time C3PO breaks the silence and says, ""I don't understand, I have calculated all the possible results and their is no way to know what the outcome was going to be.

""Ah, yes."" replies the manager knowingly. ""A most remarkable young chap. Though he doesn't look it, he's actually the son of Mick Jagger, feel free to approve the loan.""

Patricia holds up her finger. 

&amp;#x200B;

post,akyzco,2qh72,jokes,false,1548759956,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/akyzco/the_story_of_rolph_louie_the_worst_basketball/,self.jokes,,"There was once a basketball player named Rolph Louie, who somehow made his way into the Chicago Bulls. This decision to pick up Rolph for the roster made no sense to anybody; it baffled the commentators, the fans and even the players on the team. Rolph could barely dribble a ball...

In 99% of the games, Rolph wouldn't even be put in the game, sitting on the bench as a substitute. It made absolutely no sense to anybody why he was still in the team.

Somehow, even with Rolph dragging down their team, the Bulls made it to the finals. The game wasn't looking good for the Bulls - they were down 32 points at half-time. The opposition team took pride in this, and were gloating non stop during the half time break. In fact, one of the players got so cocky that they decided to do a dunk from the three point line - and in doing so, they managed to tear down the post keeping the hoop in the air!

The crowd was not happy. They were screaming ""Refund! Refund! Refund!"" and the player who broke the post had his head in his hands, too shameful to even cover his face. 

But this didn't deter Rolph. He knew what he had to do.

He stood up from his bench, walked over to the now-broken hoop, and in less than a few minutes, he fixed the post up, better than it had ever been.

The crowd went crazy for Rolph, and for Rolph, this was the highest point of his career -- nay, his life.

So one commentator said to the other, ""Man, this sub is really good at reposts.""","The story of Rolph Louie, the worst basketball player to ever make it to the NBA.",19

The Englishman was the first to jump. As he left the diving board he yelled out: ""FERRARIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!"". When he resurfaced and got out of the pool he could feel keys in his pocket. He pressed the keys and sure enough they unlocked the brand new Ferrari waiting in the car park.

The Scotsman was next. As he dived he yelled: ""MONEYYYYYYY!!!!!!"". As soon as he left the pool he heard his phone chime. He unlocked his phone and saw a notification from his bank stating that 1 million pounds had been deposited into his account.

Finally it was the Irishman's turn. In his excitement he ran towards the end of the diving board, but accidentally slipped off the side and as he was falling he yelled out: ""SHIIIIIITTTTT!!!!!!"" ",An Englishman a Scotsman and an Irishman are standing atop a diving platform.,4

Jim-Bob is wandering around Saturday night trying to figure out what to do, when a man offers him tickets to see a band for a steal because the concert is already in progress. Jim-Bob has nothing going on so he figures ""What-the-heck, maybe I can get a drink and maybe meet someone interesting."" So he buys the ticket and heads in.

Jim-Bob wanders into the venue to see it is a large jazz-style joint with a cozy feel. It's not really his scene but he paid for it so he takes a seat at the bar and nurses a drink while taking in the music. 

As he watches the large multi-piece hip-hop band he notices that they are having a great time. They are all drinking, except he notes that curiously the keyboardist only drinks bottled water. 

He notices a couple of the guys smoke while they play and he notices that during a break they all smoke, a couple of them cigars, except again the keyboardist. 

Also during breaks the guys are all cutting up with each other, and generally being obnoxious... except of course the keyboardist, who instead pulls out a thick book and reads quietly. 

As the night goes on the band gets more drunk, rowdy and obnoxious, bagging on each other and people in the crowd as well. The entire band laughs and takes part, except the keyboardist of course, who actually seems exasperated by their behavior.

Jim-Bob is however impressed by the music. He isn't into Hip-hop, but the music is interesting and very well performed, and the band leader is very interesting, cracking the audience up, and is just genuinely very charismatic.

Finally Jim-Bob's curiosity gets the best of him and he turns to the bartender and says 
""Hey man, I got here late, but these guys are pretty good, what is the name of that band leader, he is great!"" 
The bartender responds ""Don't you watch The Tonight Show, that is Questlove!"" 
""Sorry man, been working the swing shift my whole life, no time for nighttime TV... So what's the name of this band then?""
""These are The Roots, I really can't believe you never heard of them.""

""Yeah, well they are pretty good, definitely heard of them now, and I'm not really even into this kind of music. One more question though. I noticed they are all pretty rowdy, drinking, smoking, and cutting up and what not. Like the boys back home on a Friday night after a long week working the line.... But I noticed that one of them, the keyboardist, is completely the opposite. What's his deal?""

""Oh yeah, that guy. He's a bit different, huh? Yeah, we all just call him...

They decide to walk a bit and see if they can find a house and use the owner’s phone to call a tow. After a few minutes, they see pink lights in the distance. 

As they get closer they see it’s a giant pink mansion. The porch is pink too, with pink rocking chairs and a pink swing. They walk up to the front door (painted pink, with a pink doorknob) and knock. Out comes a kind looking older man wearing a pink suit. They explain their situation and ask to use his phone.

He tells them that he doesn’t have a phone, but if they’d like to spend the night he can drive them to town in the morning and they can get a tow from there. The three agree, and the man invites them in. The inside of the house matches the exterior - everything floor to ceiling is pink. Pink tables, pink chairs, pink carpets, pictures with people wearing pink clothes in pink frames. He leads them up the pink stairs to their rooms. 

The first room where one of the friends will be sleeping is no exception to the pink rule. A pink bed with pink sheets and pink pajamas at the foot. The second room for the second friend was much the same - a pink dresser, pink ceiling fan, and a pink rug. The third room for the third room had pink pillows, a pink bookshelf, and a pink lamp. The three settle down for the night and fall asleep. 

The next morning they all wake up and head downstairs to the kitchen with its pink oven and pink cabinets. The man is wearing a pink robe and pink slippers, and on the table there are pink bowls with pink spoons. “I thought we’d have some breakfast before we set out,” he tells them. “I have Froot Loops and Rice Krispies, which would you like?”

“I’ll have Froot Loops,” says the first friend.

“I’ll take Rice Krispies,” says the second friend.

“Froot Loops for me,” says the third friend.

After they eat their cereal, the four drive to town in the man’s pink car. After a few hours their car is repaired, and the three friends continue their trip.

And the moral of the story is: 2 out of 3 people prefer Froot Loops to Rice Krispies","Three friends are on a road trip, driving through the backwoods when their car breaks down",0

-""I'm Saint Peter!""

-""Does that mean i'm dead??""

-""But there are so many things i still haven't done in my life, i didn't even say goodbye to my family... You gotta take me back!""

-""You can be reincarnated but there is a catch. I can send you back, but only as a dog or a chicken.""

-""Its better if i became a chicken, there is a farm close to our house""

Saint Peter snaps his fingers, a white light shines and Dave finds himself covered in feathers, pecking with other chickens. A rooster comes up to him and says:

-""I see you are new here. How are you enjoying your first day?""

-""Yeah, well, its really nice here, but i have a strange feeling inside me - like i'm going to explode!""

-""That is nothing special. Don't tell me you never laid an egg? If you haven't, just relax and nature will do its thing.

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""",This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,16

“You have some time to kill, why don’t you head into town for a few minutes?” the mechanic suggests. “There are some cute shops and restaurants, and it’s only a five minute walk around the corner.”

Frank the penguin agrees, and figures he’ll take a look at the quant town center. Sure enough, he arrives in no time and the mechanic couldn’t have been more on point- Frank almost wishes he had more time to kill!

Frank the penguin, being a penguin, is starting to feel the heat at this point, and looks around for an opportunity to cool off. Identifying a busy little ice cream shop, Frank exclaims, “Wow, that ice cream looks amazing right now! What a great opportunity to cool off a bit!” So Frank waits in line, and when given the opportunity, orders a large vanilla ice cream with whipped cream. 

After receiving the ice cream, Frank is hit with a momentary road block: being a penguin, he can’t hold the spoon! Considering his options for a moment, he decides, “You know what, fuck it. I’m just gonna go for it!” and he buries his beak and face directly into the delicious ice cream. He devours it all in less than a minute. “Wow, that was tasty- and refreshing!”

After he’s done, Frank glances at his watch, and sees that the car should be ready by now. He makes his way back over to the mechanic.

Upon arriving, the mechanic looks Frank up and down. After a moment, he says, “Well, it looks like you just blew a seal.” Frank quickly shakes his head and says, “No no no, it’s just vanilla ice cream.”

Coming to check on his new arrivals from up North, Satan is surprised to find Ole and Sven enjoying themselves, finally removing coats and hats that they've worn for decades.  

""What is the meaning of this,"" Satan demands.  ""You two almost seem comfortable.""

""Oh don't you know,"" answers Ole, ""this is the first time we've been warm in years.""  

*Okay* think Satan.  *I'm gonna really turn up the heat and see how these two like it*.  ""We'll see if you're still laughing in a minute.""  Satan instructs a demon to really pour the coals on and proceeds to go check on his other chargers.  

He returns a while later, and to his astonishment, finds Ole and Sven stripped down to their boxers and sweating a little, but still with huge smiles on their faces.  ""What is the meaning of this!"", he exclaims!

""Uff da"", answers Sven.  ""It's gettin' a little warm down here, but after decades of Minnesota cold, we can finally feel our bones start to thaw.  We're warm for the first time in our lives, mister.""  

Feeling more than a little desperate, Satan thinks of a new plan.  ""Alright"" he retorts, ""you two were sent down here to suffer.  Maybe the best environment for that is one like your miserable home land!""  Satan then instructs his demons to make Hell *freeze*.  Heaters are exchanged for supernatural A/Cs.  Liquid nitrogen tanks are plugged in - the works.  Satan leaves to go attend other business.  

He returns again a short time later expecting to find Ole and Sven miserable from being in the bitter cold once again.  To his bewilderment, Ole and Sven are redressed in there parkas and hats, but are hoopin' and hollerin' like never before.  

Defeated, Satan asks, ""What is it with you guys?  I make Hell hotter than ever and you guys enjoy it.  I make it colder than anything even you two have experienced and you're still full of joy.  What is going on?!"" 

""Well,"" answers Ole, ""for the first time in our lives, we were able feel warm, which felt pretty good.  But now, with hell froze over, that can only mean one thing!""

Soon after the beginning of the lessons he always took a nap and slept until the bell for the end of the lessons sounded.

The son of a poor villager was a student in the same school. His name was Lee. One time Lee asked the monk:

- Teacher, may I ask you why do you sleep in all our lessons?

- My friend – replied the monk without any embarrassment. - It just seems that way. During these minutes I meet with Buddha and listen to His wise words. That's why I try to sleep as much as I can.

One time Lee took care of his sick father during the night and fell asleep at school in the morning. He slept so deeply that he didn't hear the bell, which woke the monk.

When the monk saw the sleeping boy, he got very angry, took Lee by the ear and started screaming:

- Ah, you, little weasel! How dare you fall asleep in my class?

- Teacher – said Lee – It just seemed that I slept. I was with Buddha and listened to His wise words.

- And what did the all-powerful Buddha say to you?

The bird would practice every single morning and every single night in a tree over the swamp, on a low hanging branch, and would often attract a minor crowd.  On one particular evening, the bird was singing for a big bullfrog, who was something of an absent audience.  After finishing one of his favorite song, the songbird asked “Hey bullfrog, how was that?” To which the frog replied with only a deep croak.  In response to this rather apathetic and disinterested croak, the songbird cracked his little songbird neck and set on practicing.  He sang a song at least twice as good as the song before, and much more difficult.  He again asked the frog “Hey bullfrog, how was that?”  To which the frog again replied with a disinterested sounding croak.  After hearing that unimpressed croak for the second time, the songbird began singing the greatest song the swamp had ever heard, and indeed ended the song with the highest note the swamp had ever heard.  In singing this note, the bird stretched out his neck as far as he could and went as high as he could, in the process bursting his little songbird heart.  The frog again croaked, this time unprompted, and accidentally swallowed the songbird as he fell from his perch up in the tree.  Feeling somewhat bad about this unfortunate incident, the frog approached the swamp band leader, asking to head up the band in place of the late songbird.  The band leader looked the frog up and down, asking “Are you sure you have the skill for that?” To which the frog replied, “I know I may not look like much, but I promise I’ve got it in me.”",There was once this incredible songbird that lived in this swamp.,2

The tattoo artist offers a solution: he would do both Conway Twitty AND George Jones, one on each thigh, for only $200 with a free money-back guarantee...if she doesn't like his work, she doesn't have to pay.

She agrees that's a hell of a deal, so she hops up in the chair, hikes up her skirt and the tattoo artist goes straight to work. He works with dedication and concentration throughout most of the day, first on one thigh and then the other. Hours pass before he finally finishes. He stands up and admires his work and holding a mirror between the girl's knees, he asks her what she thinks of the two tattoos.

""That looks nothing like Conway Twitty OR George Jones,"" the girl shouts, ""and I'm not paying you one damn dollar!""

""The hell you're not,"" replied the tattoo artist, ""this is some of the best work I've ever done!""

""BULLSHIT!"" screams the girl, ""I ain't paying!""

The artist has an idea. ""Tell you what,"" he says, ""let's put it to a vote. We'll go outside and ask the first person we see what they think of the tattoos. If they can recognize Conway &amp; George, you're paying! If not, they're free.""

The girl agrees, and the two walk outside. There happens to be a homeless man, clearly drunk and sitting on the sidewalk outside the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist approaches him and explains their predicament and asks the man to judge the tattoos to see if he can recognize who they are.

The homeless man agrees to help, so the girl walks over to where he is sitting, lifts her skirt and opens her legs in the man's face so he can get a good look at the two tattoos.

The homeless man, stroking his chin, carefully studies first one tattoo, then the other, then goes back to the first. Several minutes go by and this continues, the homeless man looking back and forth every minute or so until finally the girl says, ""Well, what do you think? Do you recognize these guys or not?!

With a smile on his face he hands one of his sandwiches to the red dressed guy and drives away. Not even five minutes later he comes across another guy.

This time the guy is dressed fully in yellow, standing on the side and waving him to stop.

A bit irritated our guy stops, cranks down the window and asks, “What can I do for you?”

“I am the yellow bastard of the asphalt, you got something to drink?”

Hardly managing to smile this time he hands to the guy a can of soda and then stomps on the pedal and takes off again.

In order to make it to the lakeside before sunset he decides to go faster and not to stop no matter what.

To his frustration he sees another guy on the side of the road, dressed all in blue, making a hand signal to stop him.

Not quite willing our guy decides to stop a last time.
He rolls his window down and yells to the guy, “I know, you’re the blue bastard of the asphalt. But just what the heck do you want?”

“Driver’s license and registration please.”",One afternoon this guy drives down a highway to visit a nearby lake and relax.,236

A mouse at the same time is thinking if the fly goes down the fish will jump up the bear will run out , the man will drop his sandwich and I can run out and get my lunch!

At the same time a cat is thinking if the fly goes down, the fish will jump up, the bear will run out the man will drop his sandwich, the mouse will run out and I can get my lunch!

And so the fly went down, the fish jumped up, the bear ran out, the man dropped his sandwich for the shot and the mouse ran out- saw the cat and ran to the lake. The cat chasing after lost footing and fell into he lake.

Using his favorite recipe, with lots of cheese and butter, he cooked up a generous bowl of hot letter soup. It smelled just delicious and he couldn’t wait to wolf it down. With his chubby hands, he grabbed the bowl and began to slurp his way through the soup. 


But alas, he had just begun his first sip when he choked on a letter. He sputtered and he coughed, and he spat it out. He saw it was the letter B. He was a little miffed, but he shrugged and went back to his soup. The same thing happened again! Sputtering and coughing, he spat the letter out, and saw it was the letter C. And so it kept on happening: Every time he would try to slurp his favorite hot soup, he would choke on the same four letters over and over again - B, C, O and T. He kept trying to have his soup for a full hour, his hunger gnawing at him, but to no avail. Finally, frustrated, he cast the soup aside. 


His friend walked in a few minutes later, and saw the whole scene with surprise. He had never seen the fat man sit with a full bowl of soup without eating it before. He asked, “dude what’s wrong? Why aren’t you having your soup?”

""Mummy, daddy, i wanth better wordths to speak, howdoi get thohose?""

Earl was an older gentleman, with a voice as slick as butter, every vowel was perfectly pronounced. They instantly knew Earl was the man they wanted to train me to get the voice i deserved.

The first thing Earl did was hand me a cup of pudding, with no utensils. ""Howdoi Eathis?"" i asked.

He handed me a straight straw, and said ""Use this to drink the pudding.""

It hurt like hell, but drank the entire pudding cup through the straw. Earl said ""see you next time"" and left.

The next time, he brought a connector piece for the top of the straw, and put a wavy straw on top. Again, i repeated the exercise until the pudding was gone, and Earl left.

The next time, a straw that looped upwards. One that had two 90 degree turns. A triangle. For years we would repeat the exercise with one more straw than the last time.

Earl and I were relaxing on the balcony of my parents three story home when he asked me how my lisp was. I thought for a second, and said ""It's gone, i think! I don't notice anymore, and my parents don't either!""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

shaolin kung fuThe monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",Mystery..,18

A Chinese man stopped at a local restaurant after a day of roaming around in Spain...

While sipping his wine, he noticed a sizzling food being served next table. Not only did it look good, it smelled nice too.

He asked the waiter: 
What you serve them? Look like Spanish Oysters!'

Waiter: 
Senor, you got excellent taste! 
Those are not Oysters...
they are *Cojones de Toro*, 
bull's balls from bull fight this morning. 
A rare delicacy!'

The man: 
Waah, can I order one, can aa.. ?

Waiter: 
So sorry Senor. 
Only one serving one day because only one bull fight every morning. Tomorrow come early and place order, we sure serve you this delicacy.'

Next morning, the man returned, placed his order, and that evening was served the special dish. 
After a few bites and inspecting his plate, he called the waiter and said: 
These are delicious, 
but they are much, much smaller. 
Yesterday it was bigger...
