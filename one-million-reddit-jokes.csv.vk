“Bartender Ben, how many drinks did you serve that guy?”

“Just one,” Bartender Ben says.

“Ben! Be straight with me. I’m looking at his tab. Scotches. Shots of Jurado Tequila. A pint of Six Point. You served him a lot more than one drink,” the manager says.

“You’re looking at it wrong, my friend. You are adding up all the drinks I served him over the whole night. But at any one time, I only served him one drink,” Bartender Ben explains.

Just then the guy from Morgan Stanley looks up. His glass is empty again. “Bartender,” he says. “I’ll have a another.”

TLDR: Buttsex which we still do not know why it happens to people is on the rise in Mexico, my esmates bassed on nothing say the Buttsex rate has fallen by 33%, so now they are fleeing their country to do Buttsex to Murca because we have more Buttsex oppurtunities. Their just ain't enuf Buttsex in Mexico. And we just dont know why it is happening. They are climbing on top of our butts, sawing our pants off, drilling us in the butt, diggin their borritos in our buttholes, then finishing us off with good old fashion sledge hammers. Now their taking our Buttsex oppurnunities and people are having a hard time finding good Buttsexes. The Buttsex gap is increasing on top of that. But If we can find the answer to why Buttsex happens to people maybe we can solve this nation wide epidemic. ",Why are Mexicans so good at construction?,0

In a Welsh accent that I will not try to replicate he explained that you lift the sheep's rear legs and put them inside your wellies with the sheep facing you, you can put her front legs over your shoulders and, with a good solid wall behind you, you can begin to pleasure your lady ... I mean sheep. 

Alternatively you can turn her around, again putting her back legs inside your boots while putting your new lover's front legs over on top of the dry stone wall. From here, he went on, you have your hands free to stroke her back, her head, or reach around and fondle her udders.

""Dear Lord, I go to work every day and put in 8 hours of hard work, while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through, so please create a trade in our bodies"". God, in His infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish.

The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, awakened the kids, set out their school clothes, fed them breakfast, packed their lunches, drove them to school, came home ..... picked up the dry cleaning, took it to the cleaners and stopped at the bank to draw money to pay the electricity and telephone bills.

He drove to the electricity company and the phone company and paid the bills, went grocery shopping, came home and put away the groceries. He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog. By then it was already 1:00 pm, so he hurried to make the beds, do
the laundry, vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor.

He rushed to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home which he had to sort out in a gentle 'motherly' fashion. He set out cookies and milk and got the kids organized to do their homework, then set up the ironing board and was
able to watch a bit of TV while he did the ironing. By then it was 4:30 pm, so he began peeling potatoes and washed greens for salads. He prepared the chops and fresh vegetables and got everything ready in time for an early dinner.

After supper, he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed. At 9:00 pm he was exhausted and although his chores weren't finished for the day, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaining. The next morning he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said :-

""Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, O please, let us trade back!"" The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied, ""My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait 9 months though, because you got pregnant last night!!!""",Sorry wait for 9 months,6

The day was really quite beautiful, 
and the drink facilitated some deep thinking on various topics.

Finally I thought about the age old question:
Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful 
than a guy getting kicked in the nuts.


Well, after another soda, and some heavy deductive thinking, 
I have come up with the answer to that question.

Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; 
and here is the reason for my conclusion.

A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, 
""It might be nice to have another child.""

On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, 
""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

They were clubbed and dragged away, only to find themselves kneeling before the tribe's leader, Punjawa.

Punjawa looked them over and said ""Western devils, on this day I grant you each a choice. Shall you prefer the Dance of Punjawa, or death?""

The rabbi looked up and said ""I am not afraid of your tribal customs! Yahweh will accept me no matter what upon his return! Dance, Great Punjawa! Dance!"" 

Punjawa immediately stood up and bellowed ""DANCE OF PUNJAWAAAA!"" and suddenly pounding footsteps could be heard all around. 40 tribesmen, falling over one another and foaming at the mouths were upon the rabbi in seconds, bearing down on him as if they were wolves and he were raw meat. The rabbi could do nothing but gurgle as the men entered him from all angles.

After what seemed an eternity, contented moans could be heard from each man in succession, and they left the rabbi laying motionless in the dirt, bloody, covered in ejaculate, and crying softly. Punjawa snapped his fingers and they carried him away to be tended to by medicine men.

Punjawa looked back to the priest and monk with questioning eyes. The monk, having watched the whole atrocity, bowed his head before Punjawa and softly said ""I love my life and should wish to continue it. Dance upon me if you must.""

Punjawa again rose up quickly and bellowed ""DANCE OF PUNJAWAAAA!"" and as if overtaken by a trance, the 40 men whipped their heads around and closed in on the monk. Other men who had returned home from hunting for the day also joined in the fracus, pushing their way in through the crowd to get at the monk and taste the forbidden fruit.

After what seemed an even longer time, each man had his fill and left the monk laying motionless in the dirt, bloody, and covered in ejaculate. Punjawa snapped his fingers and they carried him away to be tended to by medicine men.

Punjawa looked at the priest who had been praying the whole time and asked ""Well? What do you choose?""

The priest took one look at the growing crowd of men around him and said ""Fuck that shit, kill me."" To which Punjawa said ""Sure. But first, DANCE OF PUNJAWAAAA!""","A priest, a rabbi, and a monk got lost deep in the woods [NSFW]",3

Once I threw a grenade and it killed 19 VC....before it exploded and killed 10 more.... Another time I was crawling around in the jungle at night and snuck up on a squad of VC rolled up in their blankets asleep. So I slowly and very quietly pushed them all to line them up together and took all them out with one stab of my trusty machete.... And then there was that time when I was surrounded by a whole company of vicious NVA troops. They came at me all at once in a charge. They threw grenades and shot at me with RPG's to blow me up. They shot me with machine guns and rifles and came on to skewer me with their bayonets...... Of course, they killed me deader than a doornail..... Or they thought they did..... But I still had one bullet.....""",Old Soldier,0

Hey all, I just wanted to share some self deprecating humor. Credit for these goes to the folks in /r/asktransgender.

Here we go:

my brother no longer has to put in an effort to be my parents' favourite son :)

You guys know what my favourite dinosaur is? The Trannysaurus Rex

You have to have balls to do what we are doing.

Man up and be a girl.

YOU THROW LIKE A GIRL, GOOD JOB!

You guys know what my favourite dinosaur is? The Trannysaurus Rex

""There's been a petition going around to strip Caitlyn Jenner of her olympic medals... the petition was of course started by the silver medalists."" - Conan

What do you do when you see a 6 ft Transgender Woman with broad shoulders and stilletto heels?

Exactly what she tells you

I tell people I transitioned because I was REALLY curious about why girls used the bathroom in couples.

Getting ready to play a board game with a group
Friend 1: ""Should we split the teams into couples or do men vs. women? Let's do men vs. women""
Me: ""What team would I be on then?""
Friend 1: Puts her head in her hands
Friend 2: ""You'd be on both teams. Just switch back and forth between them.""

You know hormones have started working as mtf when gay guys start getting attracted to you. You know they're really working when they stop.

Once, when I was having an online drinking session with my friend, I went to go get a pack of cigarettes from the other room (Pre-hormones, and I've quit smoking since).

""Hey, I'll be right back, gotta get cigarettes.""
""I don't think you should drive in your condition.""
""Why? I'm only dressed like a woman.""

How many trans people does it take to change a lightbulb?

One, but before they change it, they have to sit in the dark for one year and think about it to make sure it needs changing then consult 2 electricians.

People ask me if taking T has made my sexuality more fluid, and whether I'm attracted to men or women. I tell them I'm on testosterone; I'm attracted to furniture. 

I was being propositioned for a threesome by these two girls at the bar (I am not super attractive, just I managed the bar) and I turned them down. My buds were basically like ""dude why the fuck did you turn that down!"" my response was ""what was I supposed to do, go for it and the. all of a sudden SURPRISE MOTHER FUCKER I don't have a penis!""

My dad suffers from male pattern baldness, which also looms in the future of my brother. I (mtf) like to joke that I have a regimen that could solve all their hair loss problems with the teeensy tiny side effect of turning them into women.",A bunch of Jokes told by trans women!,6

post,3ib0zy,2qh72,jokes,false,1440486968,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3ib0zy/a_bar_named_reddit/,self.jokes,,"A man walks into a bar named reddit. The sign says ""moderated, any offense will not be tolerated"" along with a list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.

As he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.

So he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.

He starts, **""I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-""**

""I fucking LOVE bacon!"" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. 

At this the woman in the next table shouts ""You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)"".

Her husband immediately shouts ""oh I love your baking, Frankenswine"".

A guy from the opposite corner chimes-in ""This is why I bring home the bacon!"". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.

""I love you too HAMLET""

""Watch out she's a PIGpocket""

""Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK""

""Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!""

Silence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.

**“I was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don’t think that-”** Interrupted.

*Slow clap*

“Am I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?” shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.

“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a troll” 

“Dad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.”

“Break off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances”

“This sounds so fake you karma whore”

“Grow up you fucking piece of shit”

“Yo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.”

And this starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.

Now our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **“FUCK! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!”**

And the bartender instantly retorts back “THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!”

Everyday, the father wakes early in the morning to go milk the cow, and every Friday, he brings the milk to the market, and comes home with just enough money for his family to get by.

One morning, the father wakes up and heads out to the barn. He opens the door, but only to find the milk cow dead. The father's distraught, and all he can think about is the fact that he can no longer support his family. In his current state, the father climbs into the rafters of the barn and hangs himself.

Then the mother wakes up. She heads out to the barn, only to find her husband's body and the dead milk cow. She was distraught, and all she could think about was the fact that the love of her life was dead. So she walked down to the nearby stream and threw herself in.

Then the eldest son wakes up. He walks out to the barn and finds his dead father and the dead milk cow. Then he goes down to the stream and finds his mother's body washed up on the shore. Standing over her body is gorgeous female leprechaun who was just passing through. She looks at the son and asks, ""Having a rough day?""

He shrugs his shoulders, ""Yeah, you could say that.""

The female leprechaun thinks over the boy's situation, and decides to cut him a deal. ""How about this,"" she says. ""If you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, I'll help you out by bringing your family back, and I'll even revive your precious milk cow."" 

The son thinks to himself, ""I'm in the prime of my youth. I can do this.""

He tries, fails, and she kills him

Then the middle son wakes up. He finds the dead dad, the dead milk cow, and goes to the river where he finds his mother, brother, and the beautiful female leprechaun. She asks him, ""Having a rough day?""

""Yeah, you could say that.""

She decides to make him the same deal; ""If you can make live to me ten times in a row without stopping, I'll bring back everyone, including the milk cow.""

The son thinks to himself, ""I'm I vigorous young man. I can do this.""

He tries, fails, and she kills him

Then the youngest son wakes up. He finds the dead dad, the dead milk cow, and goes to the river where he finds his mother, brothers, and the beautiful female leprechaun. She asks him, ""Having a rough day?""

""Yeah, you could say that.""

She makes him the same deal; ""If you can make live to me ten times in a row without stopping, I'll bring back everyone, including the milk cow.""

The son stands there pondering her offer, then asks, ""Can I make you a counter offer?""

She shrugs. ""I don't see why not.

""Okay. What would you do if I made love to you _fifteen_ times in a row?""

The leprechaun laughs herself to the brink of tears, until she realizes that he's being serious. ""Well, if you can manage that, I'll bring everyone back to life, including the milk cow, and I'll also give your family a pot of gold.""

He nods his head, then presents another counter offer. ""What if I make love to you _twenty_ times in a row?""

""Well, if you can manage that, I'll bring everyone back to life, including the milk cow, I'll give your family a pot of gold, and I'll put a mansion where your house is.""

He considers her offer, then agrees to the deal. As she begins to remove his clothes, he stops. ""I just have one last question.""

""And that is?""

""If I make love to you twenty times in a row, what's to stop you from dying from it?""

The leprechaun just looks at the boy, confused by his question. ""What on earth would make you think I would die from it?""

The only thing, it's the devil who got out, and thanked the peasant.

-- Gosh, thanks! It was getting unbearable with her down there! Well, to thank you, take this little bunch of herbs. In a few months, when you'll hear that a princess is possessed by the demon, go see the king, and burn the herbs near her, and the King will reward you. But I warn you that this trick will only work once!

Sure enough, in a few months, he learns that the princess is possessed by the demons, and no exorcism is able to stop it. So he goes to the capital, and asks to see the princess.

Since nothing they tried has worked, they let him in, and he burns the herbs the devil gave him, and sure enough, within minutes, the devil leaves the princess, probably blinking at the peasant, before vanishing.

Everyone is relieved that the princess is saved, the King foremost. So he rewards the peasant with the governorship of his province, and he gets very wealthy and successful.

A few years later, another princess is possessed by the demon. When asked to repeat his feat, he said that he is no longer able to do it. The King, furious, has him summoned to the princess.

When he gets there, the devil recognize him and says ""hey! I told you that the trick only works once!""

Edit: sorry this was blank for a bit. I wrote the joke, and accidentally  deleted it, so i had to write it again 

So a man enters the military and he is shipped of to the war. 

He stands in line for his weapons, and eventually he reaches the armory. The man running the armory says, ""Sorry son, we're all our of muskets.""

The young man asks, ""what am i supposed to do?""

The man says, ""hold on, I'll be back"" and goes into a closet. He pulls out a broom and gives it to the young man.

Young man says ""what am i supposed to do with this?""

The man tells him, ""if you see an enemy, just point the tip of the broom and go bangity bang bang. It will work.""

The young man, makes a face, but moves on to the next table with the broom. ""Hi there, i would like my bayonet.""

The man at the table says, ""oh sorry, we're out of them, here"". The man ties a string to the end of the broom.

""What am i supposed to do with this?""

The man at the table says, ""if an enemy comes close, just point the string at him and go stabbity stab stab.""

The young man, is beyond disbelief, but doesn't argue. He and a squad of men are sent to a post.

An hour later, enemy's appear in the horizon, and everyone begins to shoot. 

The young man decides, ""oh what the hell,"" and pointed the gun at an enemy solider. He yelled, ""bangity bang bang!"" 

Surprisingly, the enemy he aimed at fell as if he had been shot. So the young man kept going.

Soon the enemys were able to get very close. The young man, curious, pointed the string at the enemy's and shouted ""stabity stab stab"". Miraculously, the enemy fell over dead.

He did this until only he was left standing in the battlefield. 

In the distance, he saw one enemy solider marching towards him. So he picked up his broom and yelled, ""bangity bang bang."" However the lone solider did not go down. The young man kept trying to shoot the lone soldier.

Eventually, the lone soldier was close enough, and the young man yelled ""stabity stab stab!"" Yet the lone soldier did not respond.  

Then the lone soldier came up to the young man, trampled over him and kept walking. 

As the young man lay near death, he could hear the lone soldier saying,

""Tankity tank tank""

But by god, He was going to find out. 
So one day at school He decided he would ask his teacher. 
He raised his hand, the teacher called on him and he stood 
up and asked. “Teacher, what is Purple Passion?"" 
The teacher obviously appalled by the question replied 
""Jonny!, how dare you ask such a question. Go to the Principal’s office right this minute.""
Jonny, confused, picked up his things and made his way to the Principal’s office.
Once there, the Principal welcomed him in and had him take a seat. 
“So Jonny” He said “What brings you here?”
“Well” Jonny said. “I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me here. So do you know what Purple Passion Is?
The Principal looked at Jonny and Said “I am very disappointed in you Johnny. 
This calls for a suspension. Get your things and go home”.
Jonny, again confused, grabbed his things and walked home.
When he got home, he surprised his mom who asked, “What are you doing home?”
To which Jonny replied “I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home. So what is purple passion?”
“JONNY!” his mother yelled “ How dare you ask such a question, you are GROUNDED! Get up to your 
room and stay there.”
So, confused Jonny is sitting on his bed board out of his mind when he decides he is going to sneak out 
of his bedroom window. 
Once out, he’s walking down the street of his neighborhood when the town Sheriff stops and says,
“Jonny! What are you doing out of School?”
“Well” Jonny says. “I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office, So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home. Then I asked my mom what Purple Passion was, and she grounded me. I snuck out 
of the bedroom window and now I’m here. So, What’s Purple Passion? 
The officer promptly grabs Jonny and handcuffs him. “You are going to jail young man” he says.
So there is Jonny sitting in jail. When the jail guard comes up and asks “What are you in for?”
Jonny looks at him and says “I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home. Then I asked my mom what Purple Passion was, and she grounded me. I snuck out 
of the bedroom window and was stopped by a cop and I asked him what purple passion was and he 
arrested me and sent me here.  So do you know what purple passion is?”
“Well son” the jail guard said. “You just earned an express ticket to see the Judge due to your vulgar 
expletives.”
When Jonny was brought in front of the Judge, he was asked to explain what he had done wrong. 
He said “Your Honor.  I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office, So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home. Then I asked my mom what Purple Passion was, and she grounded me. I snuck out 
of the bedroom window and was stopped by a cop and I asked him what purple passion was and he 
arrested me and sent me to jail, so I asked the Guard what Purple Passion was and he sent me here. So 
what is Purple Passion?”
The judge slammed down his gavel and said “For this outrage I shall send you to the Supreme Court.” 
(Just roll with it). 
When standing In front of the Supreme Court Judge, He was asked why he was there, to which he  
responded “Sir, I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home,. Then I asked my mom what Purple Passion was, and she grounded me. I snuck out 
of the bedroom window and was stopped by a cop and I asked him what purple passion was and he 
arrested me and sent me to jail, so I asked the Guard what Purple Passion was and he sent me to court, I 
asked the judge what purple passion was and he sent me here. So what is Purple Passion?”
“YOU ARE TO BE DEPORTED!!!!!” The Judge yelled. “Bailiff, Get this pond scum out of my sight.”
So now Jonny is sitting in Thailand and a man walks up to him and asks him why he is sitting depressed 
on the side of the street.
And Jonny told him the story. “I was in class and I asked the teacher what purple passion was. 
And she sent me to the principal’s office, So I asked him what Purple Passion was, And he suspended me 
and sent me home. Then I asked my mom what Purple Passion was, and she grounded me. I snuck out 
of the bedroom window and was stopped by a cop and I asked him what purple passion was and he 
arrested me and sent me to jail, so I asked the guard what Purple Passion was and he sent me to court, I 
asked the Judge what purple passion was and he sent me to Supreme Court where I asked that Judge 
what Purple Passion was and he had me deported, and now I’m here, Do you know what Purple Passion 
is?”
The man Said “You know kid, I don’t know what it is. But do you see that old man across the street?  He 
knows what purple passion is.” 
Jonny jumped to his feet, Overjoyed he ran across the street and BAM he got hit by a car and died. 

Moral of the story:  Look both ways when crossing the street.
","One time a kid named Jonny heard the phrase ""Purple Passion"".",12

His wife could see at once that something was seriously wrong.

Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.

Soon everyone had exited the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seeming oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence. 

So Satan walked up to the old man and said, ""Don't you know who I am?""
The man replied, ""Yep, sure do.""

""Aren't you afraid of me?"" Satan asked.

""Nope, sure ain't,"" said the man.

""Don't you realize I can kill you with a word?"" asked Satan.

""Don't doubt it for a minute,"" returned the old man, in an even tone.

""Did you know that I could cause you profound, horrifying, physical AGONY... for all eternity?"" persisted Satan.

""Yep,"" was the calm reply.

""And you're still not afraid?"" asked Satan.

""Nope.""

More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, ""Well, why aren't you afraid of me?""

My theory is the ignition is the best place not to lose them.
His theory is the car will be stolen if left at the ignition key slot..

Immediately, I rushed to the parking lot, I came to a terrifying conclusion.
His theory was right. The parking lot was empty.

I immediately called the police. I gave them my location, Description of the car, Place I parked, etc, I equally confessed that I had left my keys in the car, and that the car had been stolen.

Then I made the most difficult call of all, to my husband, ""Honey"", I stammered, ""I left my keys in the car, and it has been stolen.""

There was a big silence. I thought the call had been dropped, but then I heard his voice.

Harold ""Dickie"" Bird)

""Bomber"" Wells, a spin bowler and great character,
played for Glocuestershire and Nottinghamshire. He
used to bat at No.11 since one
couldn't bat any lower. Of him, they used to
paraphrase Compton's famous words describing an
equally inept runner; ""When he shouts 'YES' for a run,
it is merely the basis for further negotiations!""
Incidentally, Compton was no better.

John Warr said, of Compton ""He was the only person who
would call you for a run and wish you luck at the same
time."" Anyway, when Wells played for Gloucs, he had an
equally horrendous runner as the No.10. During a
county match, horror of horrors.......both got
injured.

Both opted for runners when it was their turn to
bat.

Bomber played a ball on the off, called for a run,
forgot he had a runner and ran himself. Ditto at the
other end. In the melee, someone decided that a second
run was on. Now we had all four running. Due to the
confusion and constant shouts of ""YES"" ""NO"",
eventually, *all* of them ran to the same end.

Note - at this point in time, the entire ground is
rolling on the floor laughing their behinds out. One
of the fielders - brave lad - stops laughing for a
minute, picks the ball and throws down the wicket at
the other end. Umpire Alec Skelding looks very
seriously at the four and calmly informs them ""One of
you buggers is out. I don't know which. You decide
and inform the bloody scorers!"". ",Best Cricket Joke Ever!,4

After another month of dismal sales, the Colonel panics, and calls again. ""Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll donate $50 million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken.'""

And the Pope responds, ""It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders. The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It would help us to support many charities. But, again, I must decline. It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words.""

So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible sales. The Colonel gets desperate. ""This is my final offer, your Excellency.

But he has one flaw-- he's missing an eye, and he's too poor to afford a good prosthetic, so he's had it replaced with painted timber. It's a reasonably good job, and it's comfortable, but it's still clear that he's missing the one eye.

He's very self-conscious about it, but he's also quite lonely. One evening he works up the courage to go out to the bar and try to meet a girl. While he's there, he's intimidated by every woman and simply can't work up the courage to talk to anyone. Then, he spots a woman who is absolutely stunning-- but like him, she has a flaw that draws the eye. Her mouth is sideways on her face.

He's excited-- here, finally, is someone who can understand what he's going through! She's also beautiful, save for her one little flaw!

He approaches her and starts talking to her. They hit it off instantly, and at the end of the night he asks, ""Would you like to come home with me?""

She replies, ""Would I!""

The other day I went to visit him after one of his workouts and walked by his room when I caught a crazy strong stench of marijuana. This was going to be awesome, I thought to myself - I'll pretend I'm a police officer coming to bust him for weed. He's a terribly paranoid stoner and falls for that all the time. Right before I knock on the door, however, I hear a faint moaning. I crack the door open and peek through, and there's my friend going down on some chick I had never seen before. Even better, I thought! I'll embarrass him for sure! As I swing open the door to surprise him, I noticed that something was a little different about this girl - she had Down Syndrome. Of course, my initial reaction was utter bewilderment. I immediately demanded an explanation for why my stoned friend was performing oral sex on an equally stoned Down Syndrome girl.

He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases and not to mention all of the tractor toys which he would lovingly play with every day.
On Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride in a tractor. Timmy was so excited as his dream of being in a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven round the farmer driving offered Timmy a quick go behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove round the field he started to become more and more confident behind the wheel and this is when disaster struck. Timmy ,now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out with pain.
Timmy awoke a week later in his local hospital, both his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life.
Throughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor.
We now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. ""Beautiful lady why are you crying"" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. ""Never fear"" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar, everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry ""how on earth did you do that?!"" ""It's easy"" Timmy replied ""I'm an ex tractor fan""",The tale of Timmy...,0

As the gentleman had a rare type of blood, it couldn't be found locally, so, the call went out.
 
Finally a Scotsman was located who had a similar blood type.  The Scot willingly donated his blood for the Arab.  After successful surgery, the Arab sent the Scotsman in appreciation for giving His blood, a new BMW, a 5-carat diamond and $50,000 dollars.
 
A few months later, once again, the Arab had to go through a corrective surgery.  So the hospital telephoned the Scotsman who was more than happy to donate more of his blood again.
 
After the second surgery, the Arab sent the Scotsman a thank-you card and a box of chocolates.  Needless to say, the Scotsman was shocked that the Arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had before.  He phoned the Arab and asked him: ""I thought you would be generous again, that you would give me another BMW, diamonds and money ... but you only gave me a thank-you card and a box of chocolates.""
