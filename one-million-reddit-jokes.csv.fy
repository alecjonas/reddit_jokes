""Sure,"" said Paul, ""but I don't have a couch so you have to sleep in the bed with my wife and I.""

""That's fine,"" Bill said, ""I promise I won't touch her.""

Later that night, Bill arrives at Paul's apartment. They quickly have dinner and head to bed. During the night, Paul's wife wakes Bill up.

""Bill, I'm super horny. Would you mind doing it with me?""

Bill was shocked. Was he dreaming? ""Well I would love to,"" Bill replied, ""but your husband is right beside us. Surely he will hear us.""

""No he won't,"" she said, ""he's a heavy sleeper. If you don't believe me, pull out one of his ass hairs."" So Bill reached over and pulled out one of Paul's ass hairs and sure enough, he stayed asleep. Bill was amazed! 

They ended up doing it nine times that night. On the tenth time, Paul woke up and said, ""Look, Bill, buddy. I don't mind you fucking my wife, but stop using my ass as a scoreboard!""

After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the ""Voodoo Dick.""

""How does it work?"" asked the businessman.

The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo Dick from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, ""Voodoo Dick that door."" The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half.

""Fantastic,"" said the man. ""I'll take it!""

He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo Dick and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: ""Voodoo Dick my pussy.""

The Voodoo Dick flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo Dick inside her that wouldn't leave her alone.

The policeman looked at her skeptically and said, ""Voodoo Dick, my ass.""

When the trooper asked the driver why he was speeding, the driver said he was a Magician and Juggler and was on his way to Austin Texas to do a show for the Shrine Circus. He didn't want to be late.
The trooper told the driver he was fascinated by juggling and said if the driver would do a little juggling for him then he wouldn't give him a ticket. He told the trooper he had sent his equipment ahead and didn't have anything to juggle.


The trooper said he had some flares in the trunk and asked if he could juggle them. The juggler said he could, so the trooper got 5 flares, lit them and handed them to him.


While the man was juggling, a car pulled in behind the State Troopers car. A drunken good old boy from central Texas got out, watched the performance, then went over to the Trooper's car, opened the rear door and got in. The trooper observed him and went over to the State car, opened the door asking the drunk what he thought he was doing.


The drunk replied, “You might as well take my ass to jail, cause there ain't no way I can pass that test.”",Juggler,70

“Well come look out here”, she says, “see that car outside?” She points out the window and he sees a brand new Ferrari.

She replies, “a blowjob will cost you $500.”

The woman says again, “come over here. See that house up there on the hill? I bought that completely off of $500 blow jobs.”

post,anr7go,2qh72,jokes,false,1549463262,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/anr7go/the_aquarium_joke/,self.jokes,,"In Plymouth there was a large aquarium, it was the pride of the town and had a worldwide reputation. Despite the decline in the fishing industry the tourism from the aquarium had bolstered the economy and prevented the town from slipping into the local recession that had struck many places along the same stretch of coast.
There were long halls full of crabs and eels and creatures from the deep of every description. All these long halls converged to a large central tank that contained the centre piece of the entire aquarium. Living within this vast tank were some of the oldest and rarest creatures housed anywhere on earth. There was a dolphin with 3 dorsel fins, a large walrus with tusks in the shape of the last 2 popes, a thin frail porpoise that was said to be 250 years old, and a giant squid that was every colour of the rainbow.
It was just last year that a startling thought came to the mayor of the town. He had been on his annual tour to show his appreciation for the aquarium when it dawned on him that there was little or no security overseeing the towns aquatic asset.
During a hurried conference with the directors overseeing the facility he demanded that more stringent measures be put in place to safeguard this hub of the tourist industry.
The scheme was an all round winner as not only did it provide the much needed security, it also gave the directors a chance to get themselves in the papers yet again. The mayor turned the whole thing into a political publicity coup by ensuring that five local fisherman who had lost their jobs through the fishing decline all became the new security force at the aquarium.
And so it was that Bob, Jim, Geoff, Bernard, and Sid all regularly patrolled the empty halls of the aquarium to ensure that no intruders ever made their way in to steal, disturb or damage the livestock.
A few weeks into the scheme, the tourists began to complain of small bags and wrappers on the floor and left on the edges of the tanks each day. Fearing any bad publicity, the directors quickly hauled in all five security guards and asked them to be extra vigilant in ensuring no people left any litter behind. The guards said that they would do their best.
The problem persisted and so the directors secretly installed security cameras in order to track down the culprits. The first morning that the tapes were viewed quickly established that it was the guards themselves that were the secret litter bugs.
In a heated meeting, the directors banned all food being brought onto the premises by any staff and the guards had a weeks wages docked from their pay.
Sleeping through the hot summer days and going hungry through the long nights soon began to became a drag. One particularly long night all five guards met near the central tank - hungry, tired, and exhausted.
""I need food,"" whimpered Bob.
""We could always eat the fish,"" suggested Sidney.
""Don't be stupid,"" said Geoff.
""Lets all stay calm,"" said Bernard.
""I've been thinking,"" said Jim, thoughtfully.
""Haven't we all,"" responded Geoff, ""there's nothing else to do round here but think. I'm all thunk out.""
""No, Look,"" continued Jim. ""Here we all are famished, and there's a snack machine just over there.""
""Oh, security guards vandalising the snack machine, that'll go down a treat,"" said Bob, sarcastically.
Jim sighed. ""No one need ever know.""
""And what about the camera pointing straight at it?"" asked Bernard.
""Aha, but there's no camera pointing at the back of it!"" announced Jim.
Sidney looked on in despair. ""Do you not think that has something to do with the fact that you would have to walk across the water of the main tank in order to reach the back of it? You idiot!""
""And what would we do with the wrappers?"" Said Bob nervously. ""There's talk of them searching us all soon, every morning!""
Jim smiled a long cunning smile. ""As I said, I've been thinking. We can drop the wrappers into the tank itself, no one will ever see them.""
Geoff was only half convinced. ""There's still the matter of getting across the water without getting completely soaked.""
""I've thought of that, watch this..."" Jim walked over to the tank and splashed the water while listening.
As the others all watched in amazement, the prize animals of the aquarium all swam to the surface and made their way over to the crowd of men. Without even blinking, Jim removed his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and then climbed aboard the walrus with the papal tusks. A difficult journey across the tank then ensued, followed by the even more difficult task of unscrewing the back of a snacks machine whilst astride a large walrus.
The pair were soon back safely across and the walrus was rewarded with a Crunchie, which it seem to enjoy. The men all enjoyed a feast of snacks and fizzy drinks and slipped the rubbish into the tank to sink out of view.
The next night, Bob said he would perform the ride as it looked like fun. He rippled his hand in the water and all the animals swam over with a look of pining on their faces. Bob chose the triple-finned dolphin and made his way to the machine. He selected a range of snacks for his colleagues and the dolphin chose a Twix.
The next night was more of the same with Sidney opting to perform the ride and the multi-coloured giant squid choosing a Snickers ice cream.
The following night, Bernard decided to give it a go and took the orders off all his colleagues. He was about to sit on the small frail porpoise when Geoff grabbed him back.
""Don't sit on that ancient thing"" snapped Geoff.
""What?"" asked Bernard.
""He's right"" said Jim. ""That creature is over 250 years old and very weak, if we were to kill it by riding it, that would ruin the little scheme we have going here. I say we never use this creature, the others are all strong enough anyway.""
So Bernard rode across on the walrus and everyone was happy.
Several months later, after a set of extraordinary circumstances, David Attenborough was sitting in the offices of the aquarium directors. The directors apologised for disturbing his busy schedule and explained that they had discovered something amazing and he was the only man on earth that might be able to explain the event.
They explained at how concerned they had become that the level of outgoing snacks had risen sharply and yet the financial takings from the machines had dropped significantly. They had also noticed that the animals in the central tank had become increasingly tired and their appetites had dropped.
They had not connected the two at all at first. However, when they reviewed the footage of the security cameras, they found that nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening to any of the machines. Then one of the directors suddenly noticed that during the night something funny seemed to happen near the machine by the central tank. Although nothing seemed to happen to the machine itself, there were signs of large ripples in the water nearby just in view at the corner of the screen. A quick check of that stock record showed that this was the machine that had lost the most stock out of them all.
""And this is why we have called you in Mr. Attenborough, the only explanation we have is that the animals in the central tank are actually stealing snacks from the rear of the snacks machine. We even found that they have hidden the rubbish in the bottom of their tank.""
David Attenborough agreed that it was all very exciting and that he would love to help out in any way he could. The directors said they were planning to open up 24 hours so that people could visit at night and watch the amazing creatures perform their daring raids.
Mr. Attenborough wasn't so sure. Too much human attention straight away could frighten the animals and make them stop their nightly snack swims. He suggested that the best idea would be to set up a hidden BBC film crew to film the animals at work. It could be broadcast live across the world and so give the directors the publicity they sought. if the animals slowly got comfortable witha human presence then night opening could follow later.
The directors thought this was brilliant. They also decided not to tell the security guards as the idiots would probably get a bit camera hungry and try and hog the limelight. It was thought best to just to leave the guards to wander round as normal, oblivious to the global spotlight suddenly focused on the central tank.
And so it was that on the fateful night that over a billion people worldwide tuned in to stare at the grainy night vision camera shots as the world waited to witness the moment the animals would display their dazzling intelligence tricks in order to find food.
The directors all sat round a TV with the champagne nearby, all ready to toast the 8th wonder of the world right here in their aquarium in Plymouth.
Words like shock, disgust, and outrage don't nearly go far enough in describing what the directors felt when they witnessed the hulking fat form of Bernard slump himself onto the rarest dolphin in existence and proceed to waggle the creature across the water before performing a blatant act of vandalism mixed with insider company theft.
David Attenborough was deeply disappointed and annoyed at someone of his age and standing being made to hide in the cold darkness for nothing. The world watching at home found the whole thing to be very funny, but the amusement would only last for one night and it certainly wasn't going to pull the crowds in.
The very next morning, all five guards were summoned to hear of their instant dismissal and to explain/plead why the company shouldn't have them all locked up on criminal charges.
The guards selected Jim as their spokesman, as he was the most clever, and besides which, he'd got them all into this mess in the first place. The directors took several minutes to calm themselves down before oen of them spoke.
""How? just How? how... How could you?"" he finally exploded.
""We're all very sorry. Really, we are."" Jim hesitantly replied.
""Sorry? you humiliate this company in front of the entire world and you say you're sorry!""
""Yes. We cannot say how sorry we are.""
""We hired you to keep the place nice and you just littered it!""
""We're sorry about that.""
""So we take away your messy snacks and you go behind our backs...""
""We're sorry about that as well.""
""...And, without a care, you steal from this company...""
""And we're very sorry about that.""
""And you selfishly drop your grubby litter into the main tank of the aquarium...""
""Ah, yes, we're sorry about that, too.""
""...And you intentionally put the animals at risk. Yes! You deliberately gambled the well being of all five of our rarest specimens, all for your own greed. We could have lost all five of our prize collection through your own very stupid and very deliberate actions!""
""Actually sir, that isn't quite true...""
""What?""
""We didn't do it on porpoise.""

As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.
Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.
For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,
One belonging to me and one to my Lord.  


After the last scene of my life flashed before me,
I looked back at the footprints in the sand.
I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,
especially at the very lowest and saddest times,
there was only one set of footprints.  


This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.
""Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,
You'd walk with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,
there was only one set of footprints.
I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""

Never, ever, during your trials and testing's.

I thought it would be funny if we hopped.""",Footprints in the sand,2

post,ann9ux,2qh72,jokes,false,1549429233,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ann9ux/traditions/,self.jokes,,"Back when I was growing up, my brothers and I used to play games outside in the driveway and around our yard. Our favourite game to play was football, although we didn’t have much space, we still loved the game. We created a rule, that whichever team won got to knock over the other team and drag them through the mud. A little harsh, I know, but it made us determined to do our best each game.

We took our passion for football all the way through school. Since all of us went to the same school, we ended up on the same team, and always played together no matter what. Although in the beginning we weren’t the greatest at football, we loved it so much that we spent all our time practicing, and we became the best at all the schools we went to. 

By some miracle, we all got drafted to the same local football team. We had finally made it above the school level, and were seriously good players. However, our coach began to get seriously concerned by our habit of knocking each other over and generally fighting at the end of every game we won. As a replacement, at the end of every game, we would gather up all the junk food from anywhere we could, and throw, rub, or smush the various treats into each other. Every time we won, we would end up being covered in chocolate, icing, and overall sugar. 

Finally the stars aligned, and the brothers and I were drafted to a real NFL team. We played our hardest every game, and every time we won, the donuts began to fly. The season for our team was turning out really well, and we were winning almost every game we played in! Fans began to bring in as much food as they could to throw around each time we won. Stadiums would erupt in chaos with soda and sugar-covered mini donuts flying everywhere amidst the cheers of joy from the crowd.

At long last, our team made it to the super bowl. The beginning of the game was slow, but as it picked up in the second half, we scored a touchdown and won 13-3! As soon as the game had finished, there was an outrage on the field.

A ton of officials poured out from the sides and wouldn’t let us do celebrate with sweet victory, so we went back to going sicko mode.",Traditions,0

post,anmnf3,2qh72,jokes,false,1549425045,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/anmnf3/johnny_loved_the_circus/,self.jokes,,"Especially this one clown named Bobo. He basically worshiped Bobo. He  had Bobo shirts, pants, underwear, lunchboxes, posters, everything. This  kid loved Bobo. Anyway, Jonny was at the grocery store with his mom one  day, when he saw a poster that said Bobo and his circus was coming to  town. Jonny lost it. He started crying tears of joy, screams of  happiness, and started farting uncontrollably. His body temperature went  up to like 101 degrees out of pure excitement. His mom thought she knew  how much this meant to Jonny, but she didn't know, she didn't know.  Anyway, the second Jonny got home, him and his mom got tickets to the  circus. The day of the circus comes and little Jonny is having trouble  controlling his bowels. He's that ecstatic. He wants to get the perfect  seat. So the show is going on, Bobo is on the stage with a horse. Bobo  then says ""I need a volunteer"". Jonny, obviously loses it at this point.  He raises his hand, starts screaming, everything he can do to get  Bobo's attention. Out of some act of God, Bobo calls on little Jonny. So  Jonny walks to the center.

Bobo points to the horse's head and says ""whats this"".

Little Jonny says ""well thats a horse's head, of course"".

Bobo points to the horses leg and says ""whats this"".

Jonny says ""thats a horse's leg"".

Then, Bobo points to the horse's rear end. ""And whats this"" asks Bobo.

""A horse's butt"" says little Jonny.

""It's a horse's ass"" says Bobo ""you're a horse's ass"".

The  whole crown of the circus laughs, Jonny sits down, and the act goes on.  As you can imagine, Jonny is shattered. This clown that he's worshiped  the past 3 years of his life completely dissed him. In front of  everyone. As you can imagine, Jonny went into a deep depression. He  started wearing all black. Never talked. Shaved his head. Often hid in  his closet. It was bad. Jonny's mom was worried, thinking about therapy.  She didn't know what to do. Jonny would just get home, and cry, every  day. All because of Bobo. So a years go by, Jonny still depressed. Then,  Jonny sees that the circus is coming back, with you guessed it, Bobo  the Clown. This was Jonny's opportunity for revenge. He wasn't going to  let this opportunity down. So he and his mom got the tickets. In the  meantime, Jonny began training. He became a blackbelt in 3 different  types of marshal arts. Started getting swole. Changed his diet. Started  training with swords, nun-chucks, anything destructive. Jonny was  prepared to let Bobo have it. No holding back. So the day of the circus  comes, and of course Jonny wants the best seat possible. Partway  through, Bobo brings a horse on the stage, and says ""I need a  volunteer."" All the other kids were waving frantically, while Jonny just  calmly raised his hand, not making any noise. Now of course Bobo didn't  recognize little Jonny, because you know, now he's all buff and looks  older and whatnot. Bobo decides to reward this kid for his calmness and  calls in Jonny. Little did Bobo know. ""This is my opportunity"" thought  Jonny. He had a knife in his back pocket.

Bobo points to the horse's head and says ""whats this""

Jonny says ""a horse's head"", so smiles.

Bobo points to the horses leg and says ""whats this"".

Jonny says ""a horse's leg"".

Then, Bobo points to the horse's rear end. ""And whats this"" asks Bobo.

""A horse's butt"" says Jonny, calmly. He was freaking out on this inside now that his time had come.

Bobo opens his mouth to say ""you're a..""

""Fuck you"" says Jonny",Johnny loved the circus,0

Looking for unattended purses in a super market, etc. He takes his hauls to the pawn shop and is able to get a decent price for his loot allowing him to pay his bills. He continue on like this for a few months, however the guilt of his thieving is eating him up inside and in order to remove it from his mind he takes to drinking. At first it was just a beer or two a night to help him cope, but that began to escalate until he was drinking half a bottle of whiskey every night. The only problem was his small petty crime couldn’t afford this boozy life style. He originally compensates by just more petty crime, unfortunately for him people start being proactive against thieves such as him and he starts running into more locked cars, more security guards at super markets and it is becoming harder and harder to make get enough money to pay his bills and support his booze. 

The man decides he needs to do a big job, like a movie style do this one job and retire. He played with the idea of stealing gold like the Italian job, but he didn’t know anyone with gold so that would work. He thought about robbing an armored car like in the movie the Town, but it didn’t turn out well for them in the end so he ruled that out. He then decided he could try a bank, but not in a dumb guns blazing way, that’s for unintelligent. He was going to walk in with his best cloths on and simply slide the teller a note. He know the policy for tellers is to hit the silent alarm but to compile. As long as he doesn’t get greed and go for the vault or multiple tellers he should be able to get in and out before police arrive. But that isn’t a retirement job, he’d have to do that 50 times to get enough to retire from his life of crime. So he develops a plan, he knows he can’t hit the same town twice, and if it’s an obvious trail of banks they cops will get wise and cut him off. He plans everything to the smallest detail doing recon at his local banks to see when the busiest times were, this would let him blend into the crowed as he leaves increasing his success chance. After all his planning he goes to the first bank right outside his hometown, his plan worked flawlessly. He goes to the next town the next day and again works flawlessly. He double backs and goes north 3 towns to again get away clean. He does this random attack pattern 50 times all successful. People are looking for the robber but they have no idea it is him. 

He has around 220,000 and knows he can live comfortable in Vietnam or Thailand for a long time on that. He’d be able to go to school over there and come back to America to restart his life. So that’s what he goes to do. He moves to Thailand (for those who will mention brining that much cash, he didn’t, he deposited it in his bank and declared it as gambling winnings paid his taxes and still had 130,000 more than enough). After initially living it up in Thailand celebrating he starts to feel the weight of stealing again. The partying isn’t helping and he doesn’t know what to do. One day he stumbled across a Buddhist temple, never being super religious and desperate to make his guilt go away he doesn’t care what they believe as long as it helps, so he goes to speak with a monk. The monk tells him that “any guilt that is felt is just the world’s way trying to create balance, and how for each misdeed we do in this life we will surly face that in the next. It is best to live our days at peace with ourselves.” Perplex at the monks nonsense and how little help it was he felt stupid for going into the temple and heads to the nearest bar. It happens the first one he comes across is an English pub with TV’s showing the new and sports. He see the red scrolling bar along the bottom of a TV with images of destroyed houses reading “largest tornado on record in Kansas destroys everything in its wake. Over 6000 homes reportedly destroyed.” 

Devastated and crushed by the news of a tornado destroying his old stomping ground he recalls back to what the monk said. He starts to understand, or at least thinks he does, so he decides he is going back home with the remainder of his money and is going to help rebuild his home state. This is surly a way to balance his terrible deeds he has committed and must relieve the guilt he has. In fact just coming up with the plan he felt a sense of relief in his guilt. That was the only sign he needed and purchased his ticket home. When he arrives back in Kansas he phones up a few acquaintances to see if they are okay and what they think the best way to help is. They tell him the insurance companies are doing what they can and the emergency relief effort helps, the only thing they can think of is all the livestock is forced into small pens as the property dividing gates were blow down and it isn’t a huge priority for insure or the relief effort. 

As if a God told him so, he knew this is where he can help, he will go to small farms and offer to help them rebuild. Not only is he helping people he would be helping animals, surly that will free him of his guilt! After a little searching he finds an elder couple who own a farm on the outskirts of where the tornado hit, luckily for them their house and property is fine but the fences all got destroyed. He offer to help rebuild free of charge. The couple graciously accepted his offer but wouldn’t let him work for free so offered to pay means of room and board. Not wanting to seem rude by declining he accepted their offer and began the work on restoring their farm. 

After about a week of physical work but not too bad as all the old foundation and holes for the fence were still in place he finished installing all the poles on the land, the only thing left was to wrap around it in wire. The elder farmer comes over with a glass of sweet ice tea to for the man and to view the progress. Stunned at how quick it’s coming along the farmer asked the man what he did as he previously claimed to have no experience on a farm or repairing fences. Knowing the farmer probably wouldn’t believe him anyway he figured he could tell the truth. 

He explained how he was down and out and took to a life of crime, how the guilt was eating him alive and took to drinking, how that became unsustainable and he had to increase his crime. He told him about the banks and fleeing to Thailand and finally how that’s why he ended up here. The farmer clearly stunned and not sure if he should laugh or if the man was telling the truth perhaps he should call the cops. He took a few minutes and then said, “If that is all true, why would you have come back to Kansas?” He responds to the inquiry with a small smirk on his face. A smirk that said I am wiser than I once was and have insights into how the world works. He tried to remember the monk’s words and said, “You know you’ve done something bad if you feel bad about it and in order to make that better you have to do good. Everything is a balance and we should live each day natural.” The farmer stares blankly at the man and responds, “What the hell are you talking about?” Trying to recover from his failed attempt to be Zen he simply states it like it is and says “It’s like this I needed to gain karma, so I became a re-poster.”

""I've bred apples that taste like different fruits, and furthermore, each half of an apple tastes different!""

The patent clerk looks up in boredom, ""Sure, sure... But I need to verify the truthfulness of this claim - anyone could falsify papers. May I try these apples in person?"" Even though the clerk was clearly skeptical, the man nods and says, ""Follow me to my orchard!"" 

Once there, the man brought the patent clerk to the rows dedicated to the different flavors of apple - one row was marked with a picture of a banana and a mango, one had a picture of a blueberry and a pomegranate, on and on down the line. The man picks the best of each flavor and hands them to the clerk. ""Take a bite from the side closest to you.

The clerk exclaims, ""This tastes exactly like watermelon! What's the other flavor?"" 

The man says, ""Cherry. Turn it a bit."" The clerk turns the apple and takes a bite from the unbutton half, and is again amazed at the taste. They go through the apple flavors like this for a while: 

""This could be the juiciest mango in the world, if not for the texture!""

""Turn it a bit.""

And so on and so forth until the clerk is nearly breathless with amazement. ""Do you have any idea how fantastic this is? Some of those apples tasted better than the actual fruit! We need to get your patent filed immediately!""

The man smiles and beckons the clerk to lean in before whispering, ""Look, if you're interested in it, I also have an apple that tastes like the sweetest vag you've ever dreamed of. Follow me and I'll give you a couple to take home.""

The clerk nods and follows the man in stunned amazement, excitement growing as they went further and further towards a more neglected section of the orchard, where a single apple tree stood. The man hands the clerk an apple and says, ""go on, take a bite.""

The patent clerk is practically shaking in anticipation and excitement at this point, but he manages to calm down, take a deep breath, then bite into it. After a couple seconds of chewing, he spits it onto the ground and says, ""My God, I hope it's still in development, because that tasted like utter shit!""

Now maybe not the hardest to get, but she still gives you butterflies talking to her. 

Now you can’t simply walk up to her and ask, you gotta be smooth about it. After some thought you decide on flowers and chocolates! A cliche is cliche because it works right? You go to the store after school and wait in the line. So you wait. 






And you wait.  






And you wait. 






Finally you get through the line, checkout, and go home. 

Now today’s is the day you ask her! Go ahead she’s right over there. 

*Goes exactly how you imagine it would*

I knew she’d say yes! There’s no way she could resist you. Now you got yourself a date! First things first you got to get yourself a tuxedo. I know just the place, here’s a freebie rental card, drop by later today. 

You go the the tuxedo shop, and the place is packed. You somehow manage to find a worker to take your measurements, fit on a shirt or two, fit a few pairs of pants, and finally the jacket. The worker fits your tux on to two hangers and throws a clear bag over it and refers you to check out. So you wait. 









And you wait. 







And you wait. 







And finally they scan the freebie and are on your way home. 

Now it turns out your date has A LOT of friends. Something you’re unfamiliar with I’m sure. It seems like she has put together a group and the consensus is that everyone wants a limo. The money all comes in, but seems like you’re stuck with scheduling the limo. 

You call the local limo company just to find their phone line is down. Emails take two to three businesses days, which is time you don’t have! So you decide you drive down there yourself. The place is absolutely swamped with a line out of the door. Prom season is the worst. So you get in line and wait. 








And wait. 








And wait. 









And finally you are able to schedule your limousine rental.

The big day is finally here! All the gents are downstairs talking about how badly Clemson spanked Alabama, while all the ladies are upstairs still getting ready. Eventually pictures are taken, parents start crying, and THAT couple are already making out. The limo arrives soon after, and you’re all on your merry way. 

You arrive at your venue, it happens to be at an aquarium. Unfortunately you arrive just after the gates have opened, so the line is massive. So you get in line and wait. 












And wait 













And wait. 














And finally you get in. You and your date go straight for the food. You both find the fish exhibit and wander for a bit. Eventually you two find a seat and she says she’s a bit thirsty. 

So you decide to go wait for some punch and there was no punch line. ",Here’s how you get the perfect prom date.,9

So the Buddhist jumps off the cliff and calls to Buddha.

When he was near the ground his fall started to slow down until eventually he levitated. 

The Muslim, unimpressed by the Buddhist said that Allah can grant him the power of flight. So he jumped off.

As he falls he calls for Allah.

""Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.""

As he nears the ground his calls became desperate.

""Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!""

The ground broke his fall.

The Buddhist, while still levitating, nods to the Christian to tell him it's his turn.

Surely the Lord will save me from any harm he says to himself. So he jumps off the cliff and prays to god.

""Lord Jesus Lord God Holy Spirit save me save me"" he said as he was falling.

Midway to the ground he calls for the blessed mary and the saints for help.

When the salesperson brought out the first item he asked how much it was and was told $100. “I’d like something a little more sheer” said the gentleman. The salesperson brought out a second item, whereupon the gentleman asked the price and was told it was $250. “That’s still not sheer enough”, replied the man - “bring me out the sheerest nightgown that you have.”. When the third nightgown arrived and he saw how thin it was he ponied up the $500 that was on the price tag.
When he brought it home he excitedly asked his wife to try it on. She obliged and headed upstairs to change. She noticed the sales receipt for $500 in the box and thought to herself, “My goodness-this is so sheer that I doubt he’ll even be able to tell if I’m wearing it. I’ll just stand naked at the top of the stairs, return the item and spend the $500 on something that I really like.”  She shed all of her clothes and headed out to the top of the stairs, calling to her husband, twirling around and asking him what he thought of the nightgown.

It is by far my favorite little Johnny joke. I’ve searched the archives of Reddit and haven’t seen it posted before so here goes:

Little Johnny’s parents were having problems with him swearing and couldn’t get him to stop, so his dad goes to a psychiatrist and tells him the issue. 

The psychiatrist says “as you know, Christmas is coming up so what I want you to do is tuck little Johnny into bed on Christmas Eve and ask him what he wants for Christmas. Every time he swears, replace that gift with a pile of dog shit. 

He dad replies “well that seems strange, but I’m out of options so I’ll give it a shot.” 

So Christmas Eve creeps up and little Johnny’s dad is tucking him into bed. He asks little Johnny, “What do you want for Christmas this year?”

Little Johnny replies “ When I wake up Christmas morning I wanna see a god damn teddy bear laying right next fucking next to me on this pillow. When I go downstairs, I wanna see a fucking choo choo train wrapped around the god damn Christmas tree, and when I go outside I wanna see a big fucking red bike in my god damn garage.”

His dad says “Ok little Johnny. See you Christmas morning.”

Christmas morning comes and little Johnny wakes up and rolls over in bed. He sees a pile of dog shit. “What the fuck?” He goes down stairs and sees dog shit all over around the Christmas tree. He screams “What the fuck is this!?” He goes outside and sees a big pile of dog shit sitting in the garage. 

He is sitting there cursing up a storm and his dad walks out as asks, “So little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas this year?”

Little Johnny says “I think I got a fucking puppy but I can’t find that son of a bitch!”
