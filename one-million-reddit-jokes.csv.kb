A Russian and Ole the Norwegian wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic Gold Medal. Before the final match, the Norwegian wrestling coach came to Ole and said, ""Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has"". Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished'.

Ole nodded in acknowledgment.

 As the match started, Ole and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbing Ole and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold.

 A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the coach buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.

 Suddenly, there was a scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the coach raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and Ole collapsed on top of him making the pin and winning the match. The crowd went crazy. The coach was astounded.

 When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!""

 Ole answered, ""Vell, I vas ready to give up ven he got me in dat hold, but at da last moment, I opened my eyes and saw dis pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nuttin' to lose so wid my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit dose babies just as hard as I could.""

She married at a young age and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son. 

Unlike her own mother, she gave her offspring actual names. 

But their names don't matter.

One day, the daughter and the son came across a small puppy they found left alone in an alley near their house.

They brought it back into their home and fed it, took care of it and nursed it back to health. 

But they knew that their mother, 90, wouldn't dare let them keep a dog in their home, so they decided to hide it. 

In order to continue successfully keeping their dog a secret, they named the dog ""This."" 

During conversations about the dog which took place in front of their mother, the daughter and the son would refer to their puppy as ""This"" so as to avoid any suspicion at all.

 It worked for a while, but unfortunately, a few years later, their secret dog, named This, died.

And so it goes...

The boy replies, “I dont think so”

The woman asks him, “would you like to come to our house for supper dear? We live just down the lane.”

The boy tells the woman, “ I don’t think that’s a good idea, I need to get home so I can eat dinner with my family.”

The man says, “ why don’t you stay? We’re having a delicious pork roast and my wife here is making apple pie for dessert!”

The boy agrees, although after a minute of walking he thinks to himself, *i really should get back to my parents, they’ll be upset when they hear what I’ve done.*

After a delicious supper and a delectable apple pie for dessert, the woman says to the boy, “why, you have such wonderful manners!”

“Thank you ma’am,” the boy replies.

“You know, id like to meet your parents. Maybe they could come over now and have some apple pie with us,” the man says to the boy.

The boy says to the man, “I don’t think mum and dad can visit right now.”

The man replies, “why not, son?”

The boy says back to the man, “because they’re still stuck under my wagon.”

I’ve suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs … phone rings but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when I ask their names, she always says, “Just some friends from work, you don’t know them.”
I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home, but she always walks down the drive. Although I can hear a car driving off, as if she has gotten out of the car around the corner. Why? Maybe she wasn’t in a taxi? I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her?
I have never approached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn’t want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson motorcycle next to the garage and hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street when she came home.
It was at that moment, crouching behind my Harley, that I noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a little oil. Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?

It takes heavy liberties with the cymbal part. Joe is ecstatic; cymbal players rarely ever get the recognition they deserve. This could be a revolution in the music industry!

They begin tuning and setting up to start the jam session. All of a sudden, the tuning is drowned out by the obnoxious sound of Joe murdering his cymbals. Dave, annoyed, turns to Joe and says, “can you quit it? Your instrument doesn’t even require tuning.” Joe, miffed, shakes his head quietly and stops.

They begin the song and hit it off immediately, except for one small issue. Joe cannot seem to get in rhythm with the rest of the band, and the tempo is suffering for it. Tommy, annoyed, turns to Joe and says, “can you pay attention? It’s not that hard to hit a cymbal on key.” Joe, quickly losing confidence, shakes his head and adjusts his instrument.

The whole band is playing in tempo and the song is going quite well. Joe gets his solo, and he plays the single note with artistry. Towards the end, the entire song is interrupted by loud sobbing. Rodney, infuriated, turns to a teary-eyed Joe and says, “can you stop crying? Your cymbal part isn’t even that emotional.” Joe, all soul devoid from his eyes, shakes his head and grabs a tissue.

At the end of the rehearsal, their first recording in the bag, the band gathers to reflect on what they’ve accomplished. Rodney, the established frontman of the band, looks at each of them and asks, “what additions or suggestions do you have to make the band even better?”

Immediately, both Dave and Tommy chime in.

“Ban Joe.”","Joe, Dave, Tommy, and Rodney start a folk rock band. Joe plays cymbals, Dave is on the 6-string, Tommy has the drums, and Rodney adds his unique twang to the vocals.",9

""Couldn't give a shite if you got the shit stains out of the emperor's pants mate, show 'us what you have in your saddle bags.

The guard then proceeds to search Greg's saddle bags. He pulls out a large bag of coins, clearly more than anyone would dare travel with in bandit ridden lands such as these.

""Why are you carrying so much money my friend? Looks a bit like the telltale signs of a bandit to me"" the guard asks

""I just informed you that I was a nobleman!"" Greg responds

""Under the fiefdom of whom?"" the guard responds.

""Sir Hanz Jobs of Ravenhausen!"" Greg says

Sir Hanz Jobs was popular with the lords of the land and is known for his wealth, so the guard let it slide. 

The guard then looked to the man's quiver and found several bloodied arrows flipped so that the blood would not be visible to passers by.

""Explain why a member of the aristocracy would be in possession of a bloodied arrow dear sir?"" the guard asked

""Fairly obvious dear fellow! I have just returned from a light bit of hunting in these fair woods. I sold the hares to the trader near the southern gate!"" Greg retorted.

The guard then went to search Greg himself and found a bloodied dagger, a thumb and a letter reading: 'You are to bring me the thumb of the miller who is refused to pay as befitting someone who disobeys us, take his money and return with both to the creek at dusk'. 

""Explain your innocence in harbouring these items lad!"" the guard says

After some hesitation, the staff escorted the elderly woman to the president's office. The president asked how much money she wished to deposit in the bank.

'$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.

Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.

'Gambling' she muttered.

'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.

'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'

'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'

'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.

'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'

'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'

'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.

That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.

The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.

'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'

The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!

That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.

'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'

'Oh, nothing. Only that yesterday I bet him $100,000 that today I'd hold the president of the Canadian National Bank's balls in my hand.'",An elderly woman enters the Canadian National Bank with a bag full of money,170

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?” The monk graciously accepts him, feeds him dinner, and even fixes his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. 

The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” 

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. 
We shall now show you the way to the sound.” 

The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. 

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk 😉",You have to be a monk.,6

""Monday's the best night, when my husband goes out to darts,"" she said.

The girl agreed to have a bath the following Monday.

After her husband had gone to the pub for his darts match, the woman filled the bath and watched the girl get undressed. She was surprised to see that the lass didn't have any pubic hair. She mentioned this to her husband when he came home. He didn't believe her, so she said: ""Next Monday, when you go to darts, leave a little early and wait in the back garden. I'll leave a gap in the curtains so you can see for yourself.""

So the following Monday, while the girl again got undressed, the wife asked: ""Do you shave?""

""No,"" replied the girl. ""I've just never grown any hair down there. Do you have hair?""

""Oh, yes,"" said the woman, and she pulled up her nightdress and showed the girl that she was really generously endowed in the hair department..... very generously indeed.

The girl finished her bath and went to bed.

Later that night, when the husband came in, the wife asked him, ""Did you see it?""

""Yes,"" he said, ""but why the hell did you have to show her yours.""

""Why ever are you worried about that?"" she said. ""You've seen it often enough before.""

One man says, ""Six feet from snout to tail.""

The hunter says, ""No, that's too small""

Another Inuk speaks up, ""Eight feet!""

""No, too small""

""Ten feet!""

""No, too small""

""Twelve feet!""

""No, too small""

At least the elder of the village speaks up, ""Sixteen feet is the largest bear around here.""

The hunter was given directions by the wider and is out looking for the beast. Suddenly he feels hot breath down the back of his neck, slowly turning around he sees a giant 16 foot long polar bear.

Scared for his life he starts running across the ice field. Next thing he knows he's sprawled out on the ice, his foot stuck in a crack, and just like in the movies his gun sitters away across the ice.

Knowing there is no escape the hunter gets on his knees and starts to pray, ""God, please let this be a spiritual bear, please let this be a spiritual bear!""

Noticing he is still alive he turns to where the bear was and sees the bear in its knees saying, ""Thank you Lord for this wonderful meal!"" ",So there's this big game hunter...,14

The customer goes to punch the bartender, but before he can land the hit the bartender grabs his head and smashes it into the granite countertop, breaking the drunkard's nose.

The police show up, and learning they were witnesses ask the fencers--an epeeist, foilist, and sabreist--whether they thought the bartender was acting in self-defense. The foilist, twirling his moustache dramatically, quips ""The whole affair was so boring that  neither could have possibly attacked, arrest neither one of them."" The epeeist, patiently waiting through the foilist's monologue, blurts out ""Both hits were within 10.95 milliseconds of each other, so both attacked: arrest both of them!"" The sabreist, smiling the whole time, passes the police a note. It reads, ""Arrest the granite"".  When the police look at him quizzically, he says ""What?

No one wants to go and get the ball back since the owner is very strict, so they pick the kid who has the best manners to go and apologise.

...

The house owner opens the door and the kid can tell he's already cross, so he starts apologising straight away, ""We're terribly sorry Mr Johnson, for breaking your window, but it was an accident. We were playing football when Barry miscalculated the trajectory of his kick so it ended up breaking your window. Can you please forgive us and give our ball back"".

Mr Johnson's pretty taken aback by the courteousness of the kid, so he calls over his wife, ""Jane, you have to come here and listen to this!"" Then he turns to the kid, ""These days kids don't have manners anymore, but you son, we'll I am pleasantly surprised, repeat what you just said to my wife"".

...

The kid starts off again, ""We're quite terribly sorry ma'am, for breaking your window. You see we were playing football in the park next to your house, and then as Barry was preparing to take his shot, he miscalculated the trajectory and kicked the ball across the fence to your property, breaking your window. It was an accident you see. Can you please forgive us and give our ball back, we'll even pitch in to fix the window. Please ma'am"".

Mr Johnson's wife, like her husband is so shocked by the politeness of the kid that she calls her father over, ""Father, can you please come to the front door, you have to hear this. Remember how you always complain that kids these days have no manners...?""

...

The kid starts off again, ""Oh for fuck's sake, you can keep the fucking ball you poncy pricks!"".

The town was small, in fact, if you googled it nowadays you probably wouldn't find much about it. In the Subway, it was just me and my manager Billy. He worked the day shift and I worked the night. It was a very cordial relationship and once he allowed me to even take the day off for an important test I had to take. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Man, I had a bunch of great experiences at that Subway. I remember once I had to stand outside in the freezing cold for an hour, waiting for a shipment of sodas. I waited by the door for the delivery van (we were too small to justify a delivery truck) to come from the nearest town. As I was packing up the last of the Hi C Berry Blend syrup, the diet coke container broke and sweet, cold juices dripped down the edge of the box. It took another hour to clean up the mess, but since we didn't have any customers, it was fine. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another time, our cheese supplier from Iowa suddenly died and we needed to make do for a week with the limited supply of cheddar that we had. After our third customer in a day, we discovered that our reserves were empty. Panicking, I remembered that you could make a cheese substitute from milk whey, and so I went to work. The customer left us a one-star rating, claiming that she had gotten food poisoning from our sandwiches. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Because of our recent bad reviews, and similar bad reviews in the area,  management at the larger Subway in Little Rock decided to implement a new policy. They mandated that we had to weigh and measure out each ingredient that we had put in every sub down to exact specifications. To top it all off, we had to weigh the sub and if it was .05 pounds over or under the given weight, we couldn't sell it. The system was terrible. I had to throw out two of the three subs we made that week. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This new policy, coupled with the fact that Billy was getting married, were the reasons why I decided to leave. I applied for a transfer to Springfield Community College in Springfield, Illinois and packed my bags. When I turned in my letter of resignation to Billy, he was shocked. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ""But I thought you liked working here, /u/omegafig!""


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ""No,"" I said, ""In my time at Subway, I've had to sub in whey and weigh the subs. I'm planning to transfer to a new Subway in a city that doesn't have a subway, but has many Subways.""


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Billy started laughing, so I pointed at the soda fountain and said, ""You think this is a joke, but this Sub sucks and there's no punchline.""",Did I ever tell you about my job at Subway?,1

Satan greets him and shows him a series of doors. ""While our job is to torture you and make you suffer for all eternity, we also treating our guests well. Hence, we would like to offer you a choice in how you would like to be tortured,"" said the devil.

Satan opens the first door and through the doorway, the man sees a line of people in a row, shackled in chains. A demon stands in front of each of them and repeatedly kicks them in the groin. ""This looks rather painful,"" the man says. ""Can I see my other options please?""

With a snap of his fingers, the door closes and Satan opens the next door. Through the door way, he sees another line of people in chains. There is also a demon standing next to each person, but this time, each demon is whacking their prisoner in the head with a baseball bat. ""This looks even worse than before!"" the man exclaimed. ""Can I try the next room please?""

With another snap of his fingers, the devil closes the door and opens the next one. This time, the man was surprised to see another line of chained prisoners, but this time there were no demons in the room. Each of the prisoners are looking battered and bruised. ""Oh, I'm afraid we are a bit short-staffed at the moment,"" Satan explains. ""The demons running the room have probably gone for a lunch break. If you like, I can show you our next torture room?""

""Actually, I might try my luck with this room,"" the man replies.

""As you wish."" As Satan snaps his fingers, the man suddenly finds himself chained with the other prisoners in the room. 

After a few hours of waiting, the demons in charge of the room finally return. These demons however were the biggest, baddest and meanest demons the man had ever seen. Each demon had enormous biceps and fists the size of watermelons. ""Ye gods! What kind of the torture room is this?"" the terrified man asked the prisoner he was chained next to.

""Didn't you know?"" the other prisoner replied.

""This is the punch line.""

He storms out of the super-market and goes back home.
While the father is cooking the lobster the child asks him very disappointedly, “Why do we have to eat lobster again!.”
The dad slowly turns around and says,
“Because you can’t keep your fucking mouth shut.”

Their skin was clean, their bodies were in shape, and I wanted to be like that. So I decided that I would get a jug of my own. After about a week of carrying around my own jug, those popular, beautiful people began to hang around me more often. I left my old friends in the hopes of being one of them and I enjoyed feeling so included with the ""popular"" crowd. One day I caught the eye of a girl I had never really noticed before. Her name was Veronica and she had beautiful blue-green eyes and long brown hair that flowed over her perfectly tanned shoulders. We began to talk some and things were progressing well in our friendship, hopefully headed to a relationship. One night, I got a text from Veronica inviting me to come with her and a few other jocks to go to the beach. Of course, wanting to spend more time with her, I texted back saying I'd love to join. One of the football players showed up a few minutes later in his Jeep loaded with people. I got to sit beside Veronica and chat the entire hour-long ride to the beach, talking about classes, family, summer plans, etc. When we finally arrived, everyone hopped out of the Jeep and ran quickly towards the freezing water, leaving a trail of clothes behind them. I was the only one left standing on the beach while the others called for me to join. I told them that I would much rather just stay on shore. As soon as those words crossed my lips I saw Veronica's lips pout and a dejected look crossed her face. Not wanting to be the party pooper, I figured a little cold wouldn't be too bad. After adjusting to the water's temperature, I swam out into the deep area where everyone else was. I panicked as I felt something cold and scaly rub my leg and I screamed as I looked down and saw a mermaid tail. Looking around, I noticed everyone was looking at me funny and questioning what the deal was. I looked at them and realized everyone other than myself had mermaid tails. Then it all clicked- they carried water around to stay hydrated and when I carried my jug with me, they assumed I was like them. I apologized for the misunderstanding,  assuring everyone that their secret was safe with me. The next day at lunch, I was back with my old friends, separated from the ones I once had. I apologized to them as well for leaving them to join some other people. When they asked why I left them to come back, I said, ""We just are very alike. Plus, I knew from the start that there was something fishy about them.""",This last week in college...,3

Example, the trade name is Tylenol and its generic name is Acetaminophen.  Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.

The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.  After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.

Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.

Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer.  It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.  Obviously, we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of 'cocktails', 'highballs' and just a good old-fashioned 'stiff drink'.

Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO

Thought for the day:  There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.  This means that by 2020, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.

A few days later the cop sees the car on the road again, and pulls the man over. As he walks up to the car he's infuriated to see the pig still in the passenger seat. As he approaches the car, he gives the man a stern reproach, ""Hey, I thought I told you that you can't keep that pig as a pet and that you need to take him to a zoo or something.""

The man responds, ""I did take Bill to the zoo, and the farm, and we had such a good time we're going to go to a baseball game tomorrow.""",[Long] A cops pulls over a man...,3
post,87frc0,2qh72,jokes,false,1522126246,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/87frc0/chinese_joke/,self.jokes,,"A young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""

 Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. The female Earthling and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He's got only a teeny, weeny member; very short and very narrow. 

""What can you do with THAT!?"" exclaims the woman. 

""Why?"" he asked, ""What's the matter?"" 

""Well,"" she replied, ""it's nowhere near long enough. It'll never reach!"" 

""No problem,"" he said and proceeded to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead, his member grew until it was quite impressively long. ""Well,"" she said. ""That's quite impressive, but it's still pretty narrow."" 

""No problem,"" he said again and started pulling his ears. With each pull his member grew wider and wider until the entire measurement was extremely exciting to the woman. 

""Wow!"" she exclaimed as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love. The next day the couples rejoined their normal partners and went off together. 

As they walked along the Earthling male said, ""Well, was it any good?"" ""I hate to say it,"" she said, ""but it was really wonderful.
