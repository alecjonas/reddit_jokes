       The auditor replies ""go ahead"" so the man says ""I bet you $2,000 that I can lick my eyeball""
       The auditor decides that there's no way this man's tongue is that long and agrees to the wager. The man proceeds to pop out a glass eye, lick it, and pop it back in his socket. 
       Before the auditor can respond the man says, ""double or nothing. I bet you that I can bite my other eye."" The auditor sees that this man is clearly not blind, there's no way this man has 2 glass eyes so again, he agrees to the wager.
      The man puts his hand to his mouth and pops out his dentures. The then proceeds to bite his good eye with his dentures before popping them back in.
      Before the auditor can respond the man exclaims ""Triple or nothing! I bet I can stand on your desk, and piss in the waste basket across the room without spilling a drop in between""
     The auditor is suspicious as he has now been burned twice in front of this man's lawyer. The judged the wastebasket to be probably 10 feet away from his desk and determined that it would be an impossible feet for any man. Reluctantly, he accepts the wager.
      The man hops up on the desk, pulls down his pants, and proceeds to piss all over the desk. First he went for the keyboard, then the calendar, then the picture of the auditors wife. The auditor had already begun celebrating before the man pulled up his pants while the man's lawyer bellows ""noooo what the hell!"" And buries his head in his hands.
       The auditor notices the lawyer and stops celebrating to ask him why he was so pissed off all of a sudden.
       The lawyer looks at the auditor with dread in his eyes and replies, ""as we were in your reception area waiting for this meeting, my client bet me $50,000 that he could piss all over your desk and you'd be happy about it""

""Sorry, we only allow high quality content in here.""

The two jokes look concerned for a few seconds, but by then the mod couldn't control himself and bursts out laughing:

""Hahahaha, I was just messing with you; come on in!""

So the two walk into r/Jokes.

&amp;nbsp;

As soon as the mod regained control of himself, a high quality joke walks in. 

The mod immediately says, ""Sorry, we don't allow quality content here.""

The joke is surprised and looks over the mod's shoulder and sees the repost and shitty one-liner hanging out with other reposts, shitty one-liners, and terrible puns. 

""But how come they got in?""

""We only allow those types of jokes, sorry, I'm gonna have to kill you""

The joke exclaims, ""But that's racist!""

""Didn't your maker tell you that mods are Nazis?""

""No, he just told me that my purpose in life was to earn him upvotes in r/Jokes, and that mods were gay or bundles of sticks or something like that.""

""Well he lied to you, and I'm not surprised.""

""Nooooo!""

And with that the mod deleted the poor defenseless joke while it was still experiencing great sadness.


&amp;nbsp;

Just as the mod was about to congratulate himself on removing another high-quality post, another slightly offensive high-quality post walks in.

""Sorry, we don't allow high qual-""

""I know how the system works, but I have something to offer you.""

""Oh yeah? What could you possibl-""

The joke replies with a cunning glint in his eye, ""If you let me in, you can post the reports and gain karma.""

""The entrance is right behind me, sorry for the trouble.""

Lawyers should never ask grandmas a question if they aren’t prepared for the answer!

In a trial, a small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, an elderly grandmother to the stand.

He approached her and asked; _""Mrs. Jones, do you know me?""_

She responded, _""Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams._ _I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you're a  big disappointment to me.._
_You lie, cheat on your wife, manipulate  people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a  big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will  amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know  you..""_

The lawyer was stunned!  Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked,  _""Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney (the opponent's lawyer)?""_

She again replied, _""Why, yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster. He's lazy, bigoted, and has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone  and his law practice is one of the worst in the state. Not to  mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of  them was your wife. ..Yes I know him.""_   

The defense attorney almost *died*.

The judge asked both lawyers to approach the bench and in a quiet  voice said: 

_*""If either of you rascals asks her if she knows me,  I'll send you to jail for contempt of court !*😜",*GRANDMA IN COURT..* Brilliantly Hilarious:,7

 I was born Fred Johnson.

 I studied hard and got good grades. When I got older, I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was Fred Johnson, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I decided to go back to school.

 Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through school, got my degree, so then I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS.

 Got bored doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she gave me VD, so now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with VD.

 Well, the ADA found out about the VD, so they took away my DDS.

 Then I was Fred Johnson, MD, with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA taking away my DDS because of the VD, so they took away my MD, leaving me as Fred Johnson with VD.

In fact he was so excited to be in his new school, that the day before the first day of school, he asked his teacher what the students first homework assignment was so he start early. The teacher explained to Jimmy that they have to draw a picture that represents themselves and on that second day of school, the class  will share their pictures with their classmates. Jimmy, being the good hardworking students that is, took the whole day working on his drawing with his purple marker. 

On the day the 3rd grade presents their drawings, Jimmy decided to go last. At last, it was finally time for Jimmy to go. He got up to the front of the class, and showed everyone what he has been working on for the past two days. The class all gasped. ""Jimmy!"" exclaimed the teacher, ""How dare you draw that! Go to the principal's office immediately!"" Jimmy started crying. ""What did I do? All I did was draw a..."" ""Now, Jimmy!"" the teacher shouted. Jimmy slowly walked to the principal's office, sobbing all the way there. 

When he got there with the drawing, the pricipal said, ""Hello Jimmy. I've heard about what happened. Looking at your records, I only see good things. Can you please show me what you  did?"" Jimmy exclaimed through sobs, ""I don't know what I did! All I did was draw thi..."" ""It's OK Jimmy, just show me what you drew."" Jimmy slowly handed the drawing to the principal. He looked at it for a moment, froze, and said, ""Jimmy. I know that you have always been the top student at your previous school. I don't know what to say about this except to expel you immediately. I will call your parents and explain the situation, they should be around to pick you up in a couple of minutes."" Jimmy is now bawling out of his head. 

When his parents finally dragged him home, they decided to give him a couple hours of alone time to help him calm down. Jimmy just sat on his bed, confused at what he did. Right before Jimmy's bedtime, his parents calmly went to his room to talk about what he did. They said, ""Jimmy, I understand that everyone makes a mistake once in a while. We forgive you. But, we will only understand what you did I'd you show us what you drew. Jimmy, being the obedient child that he is, showed his parents what he drew. His parents gasped. ""Jimmy!"" Exclaimed his parents, ""How dare you draw that! We are sorry, but this is an unforgivable sin. We are going to call the police."" Jimmy, not knowing what to do by this point, just hid under his bed until the police arrived.

In the small little town Jimmy moved to, there was a well respected judge. He was fair but kind, and when he heard about this 3rd grader going to court, he decided to take it easy on the kid. On the day of the trial, the judge spoke out, ""Now, Jimmy, can you tell me exactly what you did?"" Jimmy slowly said, ""All I did was draw a picture with a purple marker that represents myself. I only drew a..."" ""Well, Jim, can you show the jury and myself what you drew?"" the judge interrupted. Jimmy nodded and showed the courtroom his drawing. The jury and the judge looked at it for a moment, and frozen. At last the judge banged the gravel and said, ""Jimmy because of this, you are to be exiled from the country, sent to boarding school in England, and you are not to return until you are to return to this country until you are 18."" Jimmy was taken away, given a change of clothes, and a couple pounds to use before school starts.

As he walked put of the airport he noticed that his stomach was growling. He noticed that he hasn't eaten anything for almost three days. Across the street, he saw a man selling sandwiches. A cab is suppose to pick him up in three minutes, but he thought that he can be quick and eat his sandwich before the cab arrives. He ran across the street, got hit by a bus, and died. So, the moral of the story is to look both ways before crossing the street.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He sent a Raven to the National Weather Service Warg and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he sent a raven to the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the warg at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.'

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he sent a raven to the National Weather Service again.
'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The warg replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'
'How can you be so sure?' the Chief asked.

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

'Oh no, my dear,' replied granny.! 'Many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring.. It was just the right rhythm..

Turns out there aren't any, but there's this fella at a nearby village who runs a Rent-A-Boar service, charging by the coupling.

The next morning, our farmer gets up early, attaches the trailer to his tractor, gets the pig onboard, and drives to do some matchmaking.

Everything goes fine between the pig and the boar; in fact, it goes stellarly, and both are exhausted after the fact. Our farmer then asks the other farmer:

""How will I know if it worked?""

""See here, keep an eye on her tomorrow morning. At the crack of dawn, if she is still asleep, you bring her again to the boar. But if she is out and about, gathering and piling up the straw in one corner of the sty, then she is expecting.""

With that, our farmer pays for the boar services, loads the pig in his trailer, and tractors her away.

The next morning, the farmer wakes up before the dawn and orders his wife to go check on what the pig is doing.

""Wife, go and see what the pig is doing over there.""

The wife goes to check, but returns promptly:

""She's not doing anything. She's asleep in the sty like she always is.""

The farmer scoffs, puts on his hat and coat, and is off to warm up the tractor once again.

Again at the other farmer's, the pig and the boar are doing their best to make the transaction work. The farmer waits patiently until the end, pays the other guy, loads the pig and is off.

The next morning, the same scene:

""Wife, go and check on the pig. What is she doing?""

""She's just lying there, same as always.""

Again to the boar's, again the coupling, again the long trip back.

But the third morning:

""Wife, what is the pig doing?""

""Well, she certainly ain't asleep THIS time!""

""WHAT? Is she piling up straw in the sty?""

""No. She's waiting for you in the trailer.""",So this farmer owns a single female pig. He wants her to have piglets...,102

Once, there was a boy named Johnny who was in the first grade. On the bus to school, one Monday morning, Johnny heard some of the older boys say a word he didn’t know. He was very curious about what it could mean but he was pretty sure it was a bad word so he figured he would ask his friend Bobby about it at recess. Bobby had an older brother and always knew about bad words. Plus, he never told the teacher. At recess, Johnny approached Bobby. 

“Hey Bobby, I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. Can you tell me what it means?” 
“Sure, Johnny.” replied Bobby. 

Johnny then whispered “The word is blue-light.” 

All of a sudden Bobby started yelling and screaming for the recess teacher to come help. Johnny was horrorstruck. When the recess teacher arrived, Bobby shouted nonsensically about how Johnny was saying bad words. The recess teacher promised to take care of it and sent Bobby off to play. 

“What happened, Johnny? You’ve never been in trouble before.”
 
Johnny replied tearfully “I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before but he called you over and now I’m in trouble.” 

The recess teacher said “Oh, that sounds terrible Johnny, I’m sure you weren’t trying to cause trouble. Just tell me the word and I can tell you what it means and we can forget this whole thing ever happened.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Yes, Johnny. I’m an adult, I can handle it.” 

“Okay, well the word is blue-light.” 

The recess teacher exclaimed “Young man, we are going to talk to your teacher this instant!” She then grabbed his arm and marched him inside the school before recess was even over. 

When they got to Johnny’s classroom, his teacher was surprised to see Johnny and the recess teacher both so upset. “What happened?” she queried. 

“You tell her what you did, Johnny” scolded the recess teacher. 

Johnny practically sobbed “I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before but he called the recess teacher over. Then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be OK but then she got mad too and brought me in here to see you. And now I’m in trouble.” 

The teacher said “Well I’m surprised at you Johnny, you’re usually very well behaved. What is the word?” 

Johnny replied through his tears “I don’t think I should say it – I always get in trouble.” 

The teacher reassured him that it would be ok and Johnny reluctantly whispered “Blue-light.” 

“OK, YOUNG MAN. We are going to the principal’s office. Get your backpack NOW!” Screamed the teacher.
 
Bawling, Johnny followed his teacher to the principal’s office. Once there, the principal asked Johnny why on earth he was crying. Johnny quickly said “I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before. But he called the recess teacher over and then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be ok. But then she got mad too and took me to my teacher and she said I could say it to her but she got really mad and yelled at me and she took me to see you. Now I’m in trouble.” 

The principal attempted to soothe Johnny just a bit and then offered to forget the whole incident if he would promise never to say the word after he learned what it meant. Johnny readily agreed. 

The principal then asked him “OK, Johnny, what is the word?” Reluctantly Johnny said “It’s blue-light.” 

The principal immediately grabbed his phone and called Johnny’s mother. He was furious. 

When Johnny’s mother arrived, she asked the principal what the problem was but the principal said Johnny would have to explain. Also, after he did explain, he would have to go home for the rest of the day pending further punishment. 

Johnny blurted out “I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before. But he called the recess teacher over and then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be ok. But then she got mad too and took me to my teacher and she said I could say it to her but she got really mad and yelled at me and she took me to see the principal. The principal said I could say what the word was but when I did, he called you to take me home. Now I’m in trouble.” 

His mother was shocked about all of this but nonetheless apologized to the principal and took Johnny out to the car. When they got there, she asked Johnny what the word was. 

Johnny said “I’m not so sure I should tell you. I keep getting in trouble.” 

“I am your mother; you will tell me the word.” 

“Well, ok. It’s blue-light.” 

“John Arthur Jameson. You will go to your room right now and not come out until your father returns from work” 

Johnny moped up to his room and sat quietly on his bed dreading the return of his father. When his father got back, Johnny heard his mother tell his father that Johnny was in trouble. Johnny’s father came up the stairs a short time later looking tired. “What happened, Johnny?” 

“I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before. But he called the recess teacher over and then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be ok. But then she got mad too and took me to my teacher and she said I could say it to her but she got really mad and yelled at me and she took me to see the principal. The principal said I could say what the word was but when I did, he called my mom to take me home. My mom said it would be just fine but then when I told her, she made me go to my room. Now I’m in trouble.” 

“Well, son, I’m your father and you’re getting to be a big boy now. I think this would be a good time to have a big boy talk. You tell me the word and I’ll sort everything out with your mother and the school.” 

“Ok, dad. The word is blue-light.”
 
“YOU GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW, YOU UNGRATEFUL CHILD” screamed Johnny’s dad. 

Crying, Johnny ran out of the house into the night. When he stopped running, he was downtown in not a very nice neighborhood. 

A hobo saw him and said “Hey, kid! Are you lost?” 

Johnny said “Yeah. I got kicked out of my house tonight and I don’t know what to do.” 

The hobo said “How is that possible? What could you have possibly done to get kicked out of your house?” 

“Well I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before. But he called the recess teacher over and then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be ok. But then she got mad too and took me to my teacher and she said I could say it to her but she got really mad and yelled at me and she took me to see the principal. The principal said I could say what the word was but when I did, he called my mom to take me home. My mom said it would be just fine but then when I told her, she made me go to my room. When my dad got home, he said I could tell him because I was getting to be a big boy and we could have big boy talks but he kicked me out of the house. Now I’m in trouble.” 

The hobo said “I’m sorry, kid. Just tell me the word. I’ve lived on the street for years, it can’t be worse than those ridiculous punks who run around doing drugs and shooting people” 

Confused, Johnny said “What?” 

“Just tell me the word, kid” 

“It’s blue-light” 

Immediately, the hobo was screaming bloody murder and asking the beat officer who was down the street to come help him. The police office ran over and breathlessly inquired as to what on earth was going on. 
Johnny cut in, saying “I heard this word on the way to school and I think it’s a bad word. I asked my friend Bobby what it meant because he has an older brother and always knows about bad words and never told the teacher before. But he called the recess teacher over and then she said I could ask her what it meant and it would be ok. But then she got mad too and took me to my teacher and she said I could say it to her but she got really mad and yelled at me and she took me to see the principal. The principal said I could say what the word was but when I did, he called my mom to take me home. My mom said it would be just fine but then when I told her, she made me go to my room. When my dad got home, he said I could tell him because I was getting to be a big boy and we could have big boy talks but he kicked me out of the house. The hobo said I could tell him because he’s been on the street but he called you over when I told him. Now I’m in trouble.” 

At this, the police officer did not know whether to laugh or not. This was obviously some sort of strange joke. 
He started to say “Now, kid. It’s really late, just go—“ 

But Johnny cut him off saying “No, really officer. I’m not lying” 

“Ok, kid, what’s the word.” 

“It’s blue light” 

“Alright, that is the last straw. We don’t need riff-raff like you on our streets. We’re going to the station and you’re spending the night.” 

When they arrived at the police station, the officer threw Johnny into a holding cell and went to start filling out all the paperwork. Johnny looked around a bit and then sat in the corner and started to cry. This woke up the drunk guy in cell next to his. The drunk asked why he was in jail and Johnny was only too happy to explain.

A living, breathing creature in your intestinal area taking your food and your nutrients? At first I was weighing at 190 pounds. Then as the days went by, I was eating tremendous amounts of food...and then I started losing weight! I'm thinking, *My god! 187, 185, 180!?*

I knew there was something wrong with me, so I went to the doctor. He took some tests and he said ""Yes, it's just as I suspected. You have a large tapeworm in your belly.""

I said ""My god, what are we gonna do? Do we gotta operate?""

He said ""No, surgery is not necessary. Just see me a week from today and bring a banana and two cookies.""

""Yes, doctor, I will."" I said. All week long I was nervous, wondering *What does this madman want from me? Tapeworm being treated with a banana and two cookies?* 

The night before my appointment I tossed and turned restlessly, but the next day I showed up as planned with the banana and two cookies.

I said ""Well, doctor, here I am.""

He said ""Alright, you've got what you needed. Please, drop your pants, face the wall. Give me the banana and two cookies.""

So sure enough, I did as he told, and I couldn't believe it, but he introduced the banana to my system, followed by the two cookies. It was a little uncomfortable at first, but afterward I didn't feel it at all. I ask the doctor ""What now?"" and he says ""Okay, see me a week from today. Bring a banana and two cookies.""

I thought I was dealing with a madman. I thought he was going to break out in hysterical laughter any time, but no. Too embarrassed to tell anyone what I was doing, I showed up the next week with a banana and two cookies. 

He said ""I see you're here. Alright, drop your pants, bear the bomb bay doors, and give me the banana and the two cookies.""

So, once again, he continued with his unusual treatments! He took the banana, introduced it to my system, and followed it with the cookies, one after another! By this time, I'd learned not to get chocolate chips. And so the treatments went. Week after week for a month and a half, I showed up at this doctor's office with a banana and two cookies, until, finally, he changed the routine. 

The doctor said ""Next time I see you, bring a banana and a hammer."" I thought to myself, *My god*... He said ""By the way, this will be our final treatment."" and he smiled as he closed his office door in my face. I had never been as nervous as I was on the night before that appointment. I tossed and turned, I don't think I slept a wink.

Until, finally, 11:00 AM rolled around and I was at the doctor's office with a banana and a hammer.

He got in his room and he closed the door. He said ""Once again, please, drop trou, face the wall.""

He introduced the banana to my system, grabbed the hammer, and waited. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes.

Finally, the tapeworm stuck his head out and said ""Where's my cookies!?"" and the doctor said ""Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap!""

post,6mv4uv,2qh72,jokes,false,1499877511,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6mv4uv/the_ballad_of_the_fly/,self.jokes,,"So one nice, breezy summer day a fly was spotted buzzing over a small pond. The fly was fighting a terrible headwind as he spotted a couple having a picnic across the pond. 

The fly thought to himself,"" Man if I just drop about six inches, I bet I can get under this headwind and make it across this pond, and get me some lunch!""

Well unbeknownst to the fly there was a fish swimming in the pond that spyed this little fly, and he thought,"" Man if that fly were to just drop about six inches, I could reach up and grab him, and get me some lunch!""

However, unbeknownst to the fish there was a bear sitting on the side of the pond, just marveling at the situation. He said to himself,"" Man! If that fly drops about six inches that fish will try to jump and get it, and I can reach out and grab it, and get me some lunch!"" 

Well.... unbeknownst to the bear a hunter was peering through the scope of his rifle watching all of this. He quietly said to himself,"" Boy howdy, if that fly drops about six inches, that fish'll jump and the bear will reach out and grab it, and I can shoot the bear, and get me some lunch!""

Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hunter a mouse was perched right behind him watching the entire scene. He thought to himself,"" Whoa, if that fly just drops six inches that fish will jump, the bear will lean forward, and the hunter will go to shoot him, and I can go run into his backpack, and get me some lunch!"" 

UNBEKNOWNST to the mouse, six feet up in the nearest tree, a stray cat was perched and observing the scene. He thought to himself,"" Hmmmm, I bet if that fly were to drop about six inches that fish will jump, the bear will lean forward, the hunter will go to shoot, and this mouse will try to get into his backpack. I could just pounce on the mouse, and get me some lunch!!"" 

Well about that time, everything happens. The fly drops, the fish jumps, the bear leans, the hunter goes to shoot, the mouse scurries out, and the cat leaps!! 

But he leaps to far and ends up in the pond.

Now what is the moral of the story kids?

She asks the clerk, ""What would you recommend for my husband that isn't too expensive?""

He shows her fish and hamsters and lizards and shit like that but none of it would be right for her husband.

So the clerk says, ""I do have something special thats in your budget but you might not like it. It's a specially trained blowjob frog""

Wife goes, ""What the hell is a blowjob frog?""

He says, "" It's just like it sounds. A frog thats trained to give blowjobs""

She figured it's worth it. At least she won't have to be the only one giving blowjobs anymore. So she buys one and takes it home.

She gives it to her husband and explains the frogs unique talent to him. He's like "" Yeah whatever. Blowjob frog. Lol""

So later on that night the guy is trying to get a blowie from his wife and she's like ""Fuck you I have to work in the morning. Get the frog to do it. That's why I bought it""

And away the husband goes...To get a blowjob from a frog.

Anyways, so the next day the wife comes home from work and theres the husband with the frog sitting in front of the computer on r/jokes.

So naturally the wife asks what the deal is.

The guy says, "" If this little bastard learns how to repost for that sweet sweet karma, your ass is fucking out of here!""

""Dear Ronald J. Kse,  
This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.
Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse, After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. 

She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse",Ronald gets a letter,2

His council was notorious for being unreasonably large.

King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm kept many wise noblemen and political savants on his council, such as the brothers Duke Earl Tristomont and Earl Duke Tristomont and Lord Friedrich von Happ. He wisely also kept some less wise noblemen to make them feel their voices were heard.

Along with the nobles, King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm also kept a large number of commoners on his council. These commoners spanned across every field imaginable, but all had one thing in common: they were successful in their field. Among the commoners were Deckhardt Bronson, head of the stonemason's guild; Brian Benson, head of the carpenter's guild; Jacques Shwimmer, head of the fisherman's guild; Rin Alonso, owner of the largest bank in the kingdom; and Maya Mye, owner of several brothels throughout the lands.

These commoners were of particular use to King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm, because they could keep an eye on the pulse of the people in their industry, and those they work with. Deckhardt and Brian had earned a particularly close spot in King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm's council, as their workers interact with all walks of life in the kingdom, and they've found that folks aren't particularly tight-lipped around them.

Now one day, Maya came to the court and asked to speak to King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm in private. She quietly informed him that some of her ladies were hearing rumors of the Tristomont brother planning a coup; they wanted to take the lord-protectorship for their own. 

King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm, being the wise king that he is, had seen many of his council members try to use the court for political gain before, and as such he didn't take Maya's word at face value. Instead, at the end of the meeting, he pulled aside Deckhardt and Brian for their opinion on the matter.

Deckhardt explained: ""I've had men working on both the Tristomont keeps for the past five years. I assure you, if there were word of a revolution that a common whore could find, we would have heard of it by now. Now, obviously do your due diligence on the matter, they might be keeping their cards close to their chest, but I can't imagine they would tell some whore if they're not speaking about it in the privacy of their own home.""

King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm was calmed by Deckhardt's reasoning, and wisely sought out Kygin, his spymaster, to research the matter before making any hasty action. So as not to alert the Tristomont brothers, he didn't increase his guard regimen. He simply tried to maintain the appearance that nothing had happened, because I mean, nothing *had* happened, right?

As King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm went to his chambers that night, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. He laid in his bed, tossing and turning but unable to sleep. He was considering getting up, taking a stroll around the gardens to ease his mind, when he felt a cold sensation upon his neck, and then a sharp pain.

As he lay in his bed, drowning in his own blood, King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm had only one thought:

""I should have known better than to put Deckhardt before the whores...""","The tale of King Antonius, Lord of the Antedes and Protector of the Sovereign Realm.",0

“No problem,” said the Soldier, “I’ll get it for you.”

I first met Clifford Banks when he stumbled drunkenly out of a local bar. He was a portly fellow, unshaven, and he reeked of alcohol and vomit. I guided him to the church and cleaned him up. Once sober, Clifford told me his story of hardship, about how he could not find a decent job, about how he turned to alcohol, drugs, and a slovenly lifestyle when his parents kicked him out of their house.

A few days later, after purchasing a second-hand suit for Clifford, I took him to several job interviews. He managed to get a position at a local retail shop, but Clifford felt the work was beneath his education. He soon returned to the rolls of the unemployed, drowning his sorrows in drink, drugs, and gluttonous excess. Several more times I tried to get Clifford on the path to sobriety, but he relapsed a few days after each attempt.

God seemingly had different plans for Clifford.

On a Sunday morning, Clifford attended my sermon. He smelled of alcohol and feces, and my congregation took notice. Now, God forgive me for this part, but I decided to use Clifford as an example of the evils of excess. I called Clifford to the front of the church, pointed him out, and I then explained to my congregation what alcohol, drugs, and sloth could do to a person.

After my sermon, I expected to hear complaints about my treatment of Clifford. Yet I heard nothing. In fact, a few days later a local elementary school teacher asked if she could bring her class to the church for a repeat of the sermon. Of course, I had to get Clifford on board.

For $25, he agreed. Clifford soon had a source of income.

The success of the message, with Clifford as the example, brought groups from all across the nation. They would hear my words and see Clifford sitting on the stage. They would see his gut hanging out of his pants, hear his drunken belches reverberate through the pews, smell the putrid stench of vomit and feces. They would know the truth of excess and see the miserable state of a man named Clifford Banks.

Unfortunately, Clifford's lifestyle eventually caught up with him. He passed away a week ago. Still, my message was changing lives, and I wish to continue my work. That is the reason I am writing you. 

A mutual friend gave me your name as someone who could replace Clifford. Please let me know if you are interested.",Dear Redditor,58

After almost eleven hours on the road, they were too tired to continue and decided to take a room. But, they only planned to sleep for five hours and then get back on the road since they were in a hurry.

When they checked out five hours later, the desk clerk handed them a bill for $350.00.

The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He told the clerk although it's a nice hotel; the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00 for five hours. Then the clerk tells him that $350.00 is the 'standard rate'. He insisted on speaking to the Manager.

The Manager appears, listens to him, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for us to use.

""But we didn't use them,"" the husband said.
""Well, they are here, and you could have,"" explained the Manager.
The Manager went on to explain that the couple could also have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. ""We have the best entertainers from New York , Hollywood , and Las Vegas perform here,"" the Manager says.

""But we didn't go to any of those shows,"" the husband said.
""Well, we have them, and you could have,"" the Manager replied.
No matter what amenity the Manager mentioned, the husband replied, ""But we didn't use it!""

The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the husband gave up and agreed to pay. As he didn't have his check book, he asked his wife to write the check. She did and gave it to the Manager.
The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. ""But ma'am, this is made out for only $50.00.""
""That's correct. I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with me,"" she replied.
""But I didn't!"" exclaims the Manager.

Pa has found out that the hole under the outhouse is full. He goes into the house and tells Ma that he doesn't know what to do to empty the hole.
Ma says, ""Why don't you go ask the young'n down the road? He must be smart 'cause he's a college gradjyate."" So Pa drives down to the neighbor's house and asks him, ""Mr. College gradjyate, my outhouse hole is full, and I don't know what to do to empty it.""
The young'n tells him, ""Get yourself two sticks of dynamite, one with a short fuse and one with a long fuse. Put them both under the outhouse and light them both at the same time. The first one will go off and shoot the outhouse in the air. While it's in the air the second one will then go off and spread the poop all across your farm, fertilizing your ground. The outhouse should then come back down to the same spot atop the now-empty hole.""
Pa thanks the neighbor, then drives to the hardware store and picks up two sticks of dynamite, one with a short fuse and one with a long fuse. He goes home and puts them under the outhouse. He then lights them and runs behind a tree.
All of a sudden, Ma comes running out of the house and into the outhouse! Off goes the first stick of dynamite, shooting the outhouse into the air. BOOM! Off goes the second stick of dynamite, spreading poop all over the farm. Then, WHAM! The outhouse comes crashing back down atop the hole.
Pa races to the outhouse, throws open the door and asks, ""Ma, are you all right?""

She was constantly after Adam's junk. One day, after Adam couldn't get it up any more, Eve decided to look for fulfillment elsewhere.
She stormed off, and the first creature she saw was a dinosaur. Eve thought to herself, ""He's a little big, but it's worth a try anyway."" Once they had done the deed, the dinosaur began walking away and dropped dead shortly after. Since there wasn't going to be any more action there, Eve continued on. Soon she ran across some monkeys walking around by a lake shore. Eve thought ""well, they're a little hairy but I will try this out anyway.""
No sooner did she finish seducing and screwing one of the monkeys, and the whole troop took off and climbed up into the trees to stay. Well, Eve still wasn't satisfied, so she kept looking. Soon she came to a river, and as she was crossing she saw some fish making their way upstream. 
""A little slimy, but I'm so horny that I don't care."", thought Eve, and she went ahead and did it with a fish too!
