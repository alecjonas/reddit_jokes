“Yes, Sister?”

""What a weird thing to think."" says the man to himself as he works at his desk.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

The voice persistently states as he drives home. The man again ignores it and kisses his wife hello.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He hears it as he's eating his dinner. His wife asks him what is wrong. ""Nothing honey, just have some work things on my mind.""

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He wakes up in the middle of the night, the voice becomes louder and louder.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He can no longer sleep. He feels like a zombie as he drives into work.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

Right in the middle of staff meeting the voice in his head screams.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

""Fine! Boss, I'm sorry, you've been great, but I got to go, I'm sorry I didn't give you two weeks."" He drives home.

*Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He sells his car and fine watches, his wife threatens divorce as he tries to list the house. He lists it anyways and sells it. His wife cries as she leaves him.

*Go to Vegas.*

He goes to the airport without even a handbag and buys a one-way ticket to Vegas. He lands at McCarron International airport.

*Go to the Mirage.*

Excitement begins to build in his mind. Whatever this is, it's finally moving. He takes a cab to the Mirage.

*Color up to a single chip.*

The man brings his life savings to the window and gets a $100,000 chip.

*Go to the third roulette wheel.*

He almost runs to the third roulette wheel.

*Put the chip on green 00.*

The man puts the $100K chip on 00, the roulette croupier looks stunned and announces ""We have a gambler here, folks."" and throws the ball in the wheel.

The wheel spins, the ball bounces, and slowly, slowly the ball drops on Red 25.

*Fuck.*",A man hears a voice in his head...,0

In spite of all her attempts, she couldn't free herself and had to wait for her husband to come home.

When he got there, he pulled as hard as he could, too. But she remained completely stuck. So they decided to call the doctor.

The doctor came, but couldn't get her off the floor, either. So he suggested calling a tiler.

The tiler came and quickly offered a solution: ""We have to break the tile she's on.""

""NO WAY, "" the husband yelled - ""those tiles are 100 dollars a piece. There must be another way?"".

""Well,"" said the tiler. ""You could kiss and caress her all over her body.""

""Will that free her?"" the husband wondered.

no, but then we can slide her into the kitchen, where your tiles are only $2.50 a piece",A young woman had a habit of doing naked gymnastics in the living room in the afternoon,18

They’ve always wanted to live in a rural area because it would allow them to escape the madness of a big boomin’ city. 

However, one night when they were sleeping, a rooster starting going crazy and making all of this noise. This noise was nonstop and kept the couple up all night. This would continue for days on end. 

On the 6th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. So the husband got outta bed and went to go talk to the farmer to see if he could do anything about it. 

The farmer did nothing. 

On the 7th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. The husband then gets ready to go over to the farmer again but the wife stops him. She says, “Hey Sweetie I got this. Go back to bed.”

So the wife gets up and heads over to the farm. 

Twenty minutes later she comes back and goes to sleep. The rooster didn’t make any more noise for the rest of the night and wouldn’t make noise for the months to come.

The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out.

The virus has been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let's Get the Bastard.” They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”

The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from “No worries” to “She'll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.

The Russians have said “Its not us”",I'm a bit cross,8

""Come back to my office tomorrow and bring with you a banana and a snickers bar.""

The man looks confused but agrees. He returns the next day with the banana and a Snickers bar.

The next day, the man returns and the doctor repeats the same procedure. This goes on for 5 more days until the man is about to break.

""Yes. Just trust me."" say the Doctor.

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

 Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave.

Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there
was ""something wrong"" with one of the two lizards he holds prisoner in his room.

""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me. ""I'm serious,Dad. Can you help?"" 

I put my best lizard-healer expression on my face and followed
him into his bedroom. One of the little lizards was indeed lying
on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do.

""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the lizard!""
""Oh, my gosh!"" my wife exclaimed. ""She's having babies."" 

""What?"" my son demanded. ""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!""

I was equally outraged.

""Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them
to reproduce,"" I said accusingly to my wife.

""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?""
she inquired. (I think she actually said this sarcastically!)

""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" 

""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" my son agreed. 

""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, you know,""
she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm!)

By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was
going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it.

""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""

""Oh, gross!"" they shrieked. 

We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked
like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. 

""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted.

""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified.

""Do something, Dad!"" my son urged.

""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot
when it next appeared, giving it a gentle tug. It disappeared.
I tried several more times with the same results.

""Should I call 911?"" my eldest daughter wanted to know.

""Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a
pattern here with the females in my house?)

""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly. We drove to the vet
with my son holding the cage in his lap.

""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged. 

The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered
at the little animal through a magnifying glass.

""What do you think, Doc, a C-section?"" I suggested scientifically.

""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,
may I speak to you privately for a moment?""

I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.

""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" my wife asked.

""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us. ""This lizard is not in labor.
In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen. . Ernie is a boy. You
see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come
into maturity, like most male species, they um . . um . .. . masturbate. Just the way he did, lying on his back"" He blushed, glancing at my wife. 

We were silent,absorbing this.

""So, Ernie's just, just . . . excited,"" my wife offered.

""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. 

More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle.
And giggle. And then even laugh loudly.

Tears were now running down her face. ""It's just ... that ...I'm picturing you pulling on its . . . its . . . teeny little . . ..""

She gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.

""That's enough,"" I warned. We thanked the vet and hurriedly bundled the lizard and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.

""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you did, Dad,"" he told me.

""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, collapsing with laughter.

Two lizards: $140.

One cage: $50.

Trip to the vet: $30.

Memory of your husband pulling on a lizard's winkie: 

Priceless!

Moral of the story: Pay attention in biology class.

Lizards lay eggs!",Lizzard,20

On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, ""Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon""

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale,

""Good morning, Ma'am"", he said, ""I've come to...

""Oh, no need to explain,"" Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, ""I've been expecting you.""

""Have you really?"" said the photographer. ""Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my speciality?""

""Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat""

After a moment she asked, blushing, ""Well, where do we start?""

""Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.""

""Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me!""

""Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.""

""My, that's a lot!"" gasped Mrs Smith.

""Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.""

""Don't I know it,"" said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ""This one was done on the top of a bus,"" he said.

""Oh my God!"" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her chest.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider her mother was so difficult to work with.""

""She was difficult?"" asked Mrs. Smith.

""Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.""

""Four and five deep?"" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

""Yes"", the photographer replied. ""And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.""

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ""Do you mean they actually chewed on your, um. equipment?""

""It's true, Ma'am, yes. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.""

""Tripod?""

""Oh yes, Ma'am, I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too heavy to be held in the hand very long.

With that, Mrs. Smith fainted.",The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family.,439

When it was time to take the children to the bathroom, it was decided

other.




The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the mens room when 
one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the 
urinal.




Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and 
began hoisting the little boys up one by one, holding on to their 
'wee-wees' to direct the flow away from their clothes.




As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually 
well endowed. Trying not t o show that she was staring the teacher said,

Inside he meets the farmers wife and their beautiful daughter. When he walks into the kitchen, he's astounded by the biggest pile of dirty dishes he has ever seen. 'We have one dinner rule', the farmer says. 'Whoever speaks during dinner, has to do the dishes.'

Dinner is served and everyone is enjoying the meal in total silence. When desert comes, the farmers daughter takes off her top, and starts frisking the man. In about two minutes they are making love, right there on the table. Nobody utters a word. 

After they finish, the farmers wife gets under the table, and blows the man like he's never been blown before. Right after she climbs on his lap, and rides him like a bull. Still, nobody has said a word. 

When she's done, the man lights a sigarette and peeks out of the window. He notices it's started drizzling outside, and remembers his bike is out in the open. He jolts up, grabs the vaseline and bolts to the front door, only to find it locked. 

He sprints back into the kitchen, making wild armgestures to the farmer, pointing outside, to the door and to his tiny jar of vaseline. The farmer, white with fear, then says: 'Allright allright, I'll do the dishes!'",A young man buys a brand-new bike,540

He calls the barman over and asks him what the deal with the cat is and can he have a look at it. The man shrugs, goes into the back and returns with a mangy old Tom cat.

“Here you go,” says the barman, “have a chat with him yourself. He’s still for sale - five quid.”

“Hello.” Says the cat.
“Wow, you really can talk!” The man says.
“Oh yes, buy me a pint and packet of pork scratchings and I’ll tell you all about it.” So the man buys the cat a pint and some scratchies.
“It all began,” the cat begins after taking a long drink, “back in the 1860s. India, don’t you know. I was The viceroy’s pet. Went everywhere with him, watched the birth of a great nation. Marvellous really. One day I met this ancient yogi who taught me the secrets of the universe - infinite bliss, how to communicate in any language, immortality, the lot. I studied under him for weeks and weeks. Well, after that I couldn’t stay confined to the Raj for much longer and took off on an extended quest; travelled through Asia and ended up in Novograd, Russia. Beastly cold place - don’t go, take it from me. There was this tall beardy chap, Radputin or something his name was. Anyway, I convinced him it would be a grand idea to get in with the tsarina, gullible little thing but quite rich and I’d picked up a liking for caviar and bolly by then. Then I got bored again and wandered off halfway through one of their many parties.”

The cat has another deep drink and looks meaningfully at his nearly empty glass.

“Another one?” The man says.
“Splendid! So, I left the tsars and that wild eyed Georgian fellow to get on with whatever they were doing and made my way along the Danube to Central Europe. Ended up in this coffee shop in Vienna, inhabited by the strangest types. One of them, painter he said he was but they were dreadful really, took kindly to me. I tried to encourage him by shredding his papers and shitting in his shoes but he just got angrier and angrier. One day I brought him back a half dead mouse as a treat and he just flipped, started going on about “untermensch” and “filthy mausen” infesting the land. Quite put the willies up me, so I fucked off again. Luckily Avi Lieberwitz came by just at that moment to check how Ad was doing. I heard them playing about all the way down the road.

I don’t remember much of the next few years- got in with a bad crowd. I started hanging out on this airforce base and some of the yanks there sort of adopted me as a mascot. It was alright I suppose. One night I was out for a stroll when I came upon this great big wall, all grey and new. I hopped up on it to have a look and you wouldn’t believe what I saw on the other side. This whole family was there, hiding in the shadows. The man had a ladder and he placed it up against the wall and held it steady while his wife climbed up. Now I now about ladders - you’re supposed to weave in and out of the bottom rungs, making a yowling noise while it shakes and quivers. I’ve just started my routine when the man goes to kick me - I mean the nerve of him! So I hissed and spit and clawed his shins until he let go of the ladder and it fell with a crash. Then there were all these bright lights and shouting voices so I ran away before the banging started.”

The man is sitting there gobsmacked at this point.

“Ahem.”

“Oh right.” The man gestures for the barman who pours another pint for the cat.

“Go on, what happened next?”
“Really old boy? Ok. So there was this greasy fellow on the airforce base, Elvis something or other. He took me in and when he eventually finished his service he took me back to Tennessee. Great place. Good music, good food, more ladies than you can shake your tail at. Anyway I developed this irritation in my anal glands which left me walking rather oddly. I’d sort of strut, shifting my weight about so as not to leak anywhere. He thought this was great fun, we spent ages together, him with his guitar, me prowling, stiff legged across the floor in time to the beat.”

The cat stopped again.

“I’ve got to go for a slash. Watch my stuff, yeah?”

“Sure, of course!” After the cat has left he calls the barman over again. “This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen! What a life story! And all from a real TALKING cat!”

“Mm. yeah, whatever.” The barman mutters gloomily.

“What are you talking about! This is incredible! Why does no one else know about this?” The man stops and pauses briefly, thinking hard.
“And why are you selling him so cheaply?”

The barman gives a weary sigh and plonks the glass he is polishing down on the bar. He looks over at the man.

“You wanna know why I want rid of him?”

“Yes, of course!”

“Because it’s all bullshit, he never did any of that stuff and the little prick never buys his round.”",My take on a shaggy dog story,6

Day 1. Oh, that's nice.

Day 3. I read books and rest.

Day 5. I bingwatched ""Friends"".

Day 7. I talked to the washing machine, but I had worse days.

Day 9. My washing machine is angry. I never had worse days.

Day 11. I'm fine… So-so… Probably… Well, I guess according to my cat I am fine.

Day 13. My mind and subconscious mind have been drinking wine for three hours and singing ""Star-Spangled Banner"".

Day 15. I have no fever. So at least Chocko - my mixer - told me.

Day 17. I befriended the washing machine and finally stopped crying. Now I'm just laughing .. for what I don't know too ...

Day 19. The camel that I grow in my bathroom told me that it was no longer wrapped in one place, so I would walk it a little on the terrace.

Day 21. Dumbledore is in my living room and peels peppers. I am helping him. We're fine.

Day 23. I dreamed of Donald Trump. He told me to not go anywhere, then slapped me and became Kim Jong-Un. I woke up calm.

Day 25. My seven chakras turned out to be fourteen. How did I know? I caught them in my bedroom hugging each other.

Day 32. Today my washing machine, mixer and camel were offended and now no one but the cat is talking to me.

Day 40. Quarantine was extended today. The good news is that the cat caught a mouse that speaks French and cooks. I'm not going to be hungry anymore.

Day 44. Me and the antenna on the top of the roof have a secret connection. Basically, she goes out with the Cable, but what shall I do. Love does not ask.

Day 50. The cat found out about our relationship and told the Cable. No one talks to me now.

Day 98. The aliens came to Earth, but they do not let them in the country, because they do not have Visas and need to be quarantined for 120 days.

Day 108. I came to enlightenment. This isolation helped me connect to space. From there, I was told that Dwayne Johnson and Madonna are KGB agents, and that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un are Siamese twins, but they do not know that the Lord is American.

Day 110 and ... Is it night ... I ate the cat, mouse and camel. I also tried to eat the mixer, but I broke a tooth.

DAY 120 and… I watched the news… I took a rope and decided to do bungee from the terrace… but… The last thing I hear after it cuts and I break my neck is how they announce that quarantine is lifting…

Day 1 at the hospital. I lie in plaster, and Dumbledore brings me juices and fruit.

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. 

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.

 So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time she attempted the step, and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. 

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!' The Texan smiled and drawled, ""Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we are friends.""",A girl with tight skirt tries to get on a bus....,11251

They began drilling through the crust and discovered lakes of water, something they’d never seen before. Soon they were planting crops and irrigating water to the surface where new life forms were created and thriving. 

Then, one day as they were digging up their harvest, one of them noticed something completely foreign and amazing in the sky: A cloud. The human stared in awe at this massive spectacle floating through the barren Mars atmosphere. After a while, the cloud neared and began drizzling water all across their fields.

With haste, the first human raced back to the bunker and exclaimed, “It’s happening, just like the books said it would! It’s raining!”
