One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight.

The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler dogs in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, killed his siblings, and gave him all the milk. They used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it. 

When the day came for the fight, the Americans showed up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog. ""When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out and wrapped itself around the outside of the ring. It had the Russian dog almost completely surrounded. When the Russian dog leaned over to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund leaned up and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog.

The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. `We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler dogs in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.""

The pickaxe got pretty depressed about this, convinced it was never gonna get used. The guy who made it reassured it that, no, it might not be much good as a pickaxe, but one day, everyone was gonna want a tool like that.

Later, it was discovered that the pick's unique weight distribution and ability to correct itself made it an ideal hammer; however, by that point, the plans for it had been lost, so the hammer was the only one of its kind. People started fighting over it, before someone finally came to the conclusion that the hammer should be communal property.

Of course, like all tools, the hammer eventually broke and had to be retired. It decided to give one last hurrah to the people it had helped over the course of its life, and so published an autobiography. The first chapter reads like so:

post,97vlw8,2qh72,jokes,false,1534449478,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/97vlw8/the_tale_of_three_brilliant_brothers/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there lived a rich old man in a remote town. This old man had three sons who are among the smartest people of the century. One day, this old man fell extremely sick, and felt the inevitable is coming. He asked his sons to gather around his deathbed and wanted to talk to them for one last time.

– My sons, my time is almost up. Of course, when I am gone, all my wealth will be yours. However, I do not want you to fight over who inherits what. Go to the judge of the city, he is a just and a smart man, I am sure you will not object to his final decision on the matter.

Not long after, the man passes away, and the sons start their trip to the city. On the way there, they pass meadows, bodies of water, muddy plains, hills, and valleys. At some point, they come across a man, and after a small chit chat, he asks them if they saw his horse.

The oldest brother asks:

– Did it have a blind eye?

The man says “Yes.”

The middle brother asks:

– Was its tail cut?

The man says ""Yes.""

The youngest brother asks:

– Was it limping?

The man says ""Yes"" to him, as well.

After these, the brothers tell the man they did not see his horse. The man gets angry and asks them ""How can this be possible if you know all the features of the animal? You are obviously lying! I will come with you to the judge and will have him sentence you to some kind of a punishment.""

The boys, fearing no punishment, agree, and after a while, they all arrive at the house of the judge. The boys explain why they came to see him, and the owner of the horse also explains his problem with the brothers.

The judge asks the brothers one by one:

– How did you know that the animal was blind in one eye?

– Sir, while we were coming here, we passed by some meadows, only one side of the path was damaged as if something was eating the grass only from that side. That's how I figured it out.

– And, how did you know that the animal's tail was cut?

– Sir, while we were coming here, I saw horse droppings all scattered around. If it had a full tail, the droppings would be more ""orderly."" That's how I figured it out.

– And, how did you know that the animal was limping?

– Sir, on our way here, we passed by a lake. I saw three full footprints and a half one alongside them. That's how I figured it out.

The man finally admits that the brothers have not seen his horse, and goes away. And then the judge thinks ""These three brothers are way more smarter than me, how can I ever think of a way to divide their father's wealth that they have not? They would easily see a flaw in my decision, and they may accuse me of being unfair. I should throw them a feast and just stand nearby while they are talking to see their ordinary conversations. Maybe they are up to something, or maybe they have something in their mind to divide up the wealth.""

While they are eating their dinner, the judge makes up an excuse to leave the room and moves behind the door to eavesdrop on them.

The oldest brother says:

– The sheep is delicious. I only wish it did not suckle a dog.

The middle brother says:

– The wine is delicious. I only wish the grapes were not grown on a cemetery soil.

The youngest brother says:

– The judge is an excellent person. I only wish he was not a faggot.

Hearing enough, the judge goes around to ask...

...To the shepherd he purchased the sheep from:

– What did that sheep suckle on?

The shepherd says:

– Well, its mother was dead not long after it was born. So, I gave it to the dog to raise it.

...To the winery:

– Where were the grapes of that wine harvested?

The owner says:

– Well, the best soil around here is in the cemetery. So I just grow them there.

The judge, seeing the brothers were right about the first two, goes to look for his mother and asks her:

– Mother, am I a faggot?

She answers:
– My dear boy, you seemed not to remember it, until now; but, yes, you had a ""fling"" with the lumberjack's boy when you were both little. You must have suppressed your memories.

The judge, amazed, returns to his house to finally face the brothers:

To the oldest brother:

– Tell me, how did you know the sheep suckled a dog?

– It was obvious! Normally, a sheep would not have fat in a certain area of its hind legs; but, this one had.

To the middle brother:

– Tell me, how did you know the grapes for the wine were grown in the cemetery soil?

– It was obvious! I could not enjoy myself no matter how much I drank. It only gave me a certain sense of sorrow.

To the youngest brother:

– And tell me, how did you know that I was a faggot?

– It was obvious! You would not have a Confederate flag at your porch if you were not a faggot.",The Tale of Three Brilliant Brothers,16

There are only three spears. 

Zog grabs a spear and proclaims “I am oldest hunter, I must have spear.” He runs out to fight the tiger. 

Oonda gets up, and states “Since I am the smartest hunter in all the land, I will humbly take a spear, and, in service to our great tribe, I will use my cunning to trap and kill the beast.” And he goes out the cave stealthily. 

Krunt looks at the boy with the glassy eyes of one who has witnessed much death, much misery, and much abandonment. 

The boy says to Krunt, “Don’t worry, esteemed one. We can both take a spear. The smartest hunter in all the land just went of to fight a saber tooth using my ceremonial spirit-calling rod!”

Determined to find out why he has a fruit where his head should be he casually walks over and asks, 

“Excuse me sir but I am just dying to know what happened to your head?!”

“Why what happened to it?”

“Well... its an orange!”

“Oh yes, it’s a long story and I would rather not get into it now if you don’t mind.”

This man refused however, to take no for an answer. Still determined he bought the man a drink and once again politely requested he tell the long story. 

The orange-headed man, now with an extra drink, grudgingly accepts to tell the tale. 

“So I was walking down the boardwalk with my wife at the time and we decided to go into this lamp shop that has since gone out of business. I stumble upon this dusty old one that caught my eye and brushed off the coat of dust. To my surprise a big ol’ genie popped out and offered me three wishes!”

Knowing that genies had reputation for being tricky when granting wishes, the man was eager to find out what wish had gotten turned around to make this man have an orange for a head. 

“So what was your first wish?” The man asks. 

“My first wish was to be the wealthiest man in the world.”

“Well congratulations, you should be buying me the drinks! What was your second wish?”

“My second wish was to have every woman to fall madly in love with me. My wife has since divorced me due to all of my affairs.”

“That seems to come in handy now that you have an orange for a head. And the third?”

The orange-headed man goes silent for a minute. 

“Well? What was the wish sir, I am dying to know!”

“My third and final wish... was to have an orange for a head.”

‘All these function together in a system known as politics.’ The boy was confused and admitted that he did not follow. He went to bed disappointed. In the middle of the night, he felt very restless and went up to his dad again. He went to the master bedroom but his dad wasn’t there. The boy checked in his brother’s room, but he wasn’t there either. Instead, he noticed that his brother had soiled his nappy and went looking for the maid to clean the mess. There he saw his dad having sex with the maid. He saw everything and went back to sleep 

Next morning, at the breakfast table, the boy’s dad asked him if he understood what politics was. The boy nodded and said, ‘In politics, the capitalist screws the working class while the government sleeps and the public watches, while the future of the country lies in shit.’

At the end of the training, the instructor tells the class he’s going to release a rabbit and they are to track it, capture it, and bring it back.

First, a rabbit is released for the FBI agents, and the FBI agents return 15 min later with the rabbit in tow. The instructor asked what led to their success, and the lead agent says “I just thought like a rabbit. I knew where it would run and how it would hide. Approached from downwind and took the rabbit into custody.”

Next, a rabbit is released for the troopers. About an hour later they return with the rabbit in hand. The instructor asks how they were successful, and the senior trooper says “We used our radios to call for the helicopter and 8 more troopers from a different post. Took a bit of manpower, but we eventually took it into custody.”

Then a rabbit was released for the Detroit cops.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.

The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.

The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.

Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist list the others.""

""It almost looks like he's waving,"" said the second Alien.

""Let me see,"" said the third Alien. ""Wow! I don't believe it.""

""What?"" Asked the second Alien.

Terrified, the man begins to run towards his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him

He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door and rushes in and locks the door behind him.

In a trial in Tullamore recently a small-town prosecuting solicitor called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Murphy, do you know me?' She responded, 'Yes, I do know you, Mr. Burke. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big lad when you haven't the brains to realise you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit pen pusher. Yes, I know you.'
The solicitor was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Murphy, do you know the defence lawyer?'
She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Cummins since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, snobby, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire country. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'
The defence lawyer nearly died.
The judge asked both counsellors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,
'If either of you idiots ask her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the Mountjoy prison for ten years each.",Good old Irish Granny....,6

He kisses his wife and promises to be a better man. He decides to do all the chores in the house for the entire day. The man vacuums the whole house, does the laundry and then decides to walk his dog. 

He puts his dog on the leash and walks out the front door. But then, just when he is about to start his walk, he sees the milkman lying dead on the pavement.","A man and a woman had a child together, but after two years the child had not yet said a word...",297

As I was about to tee off at the fourth hole I heard a voice say, three wood. I looked around and no one was behind me so I took my stance. Then once again I heard ..three wood. I looked down and there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and it was telling me to use my three wood. I thought it was stupid but I was playing so badly that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out my three wood. It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight 250 yards with that three wood. Since the frog seemed to be lucky I picked it up and took it along with me. At the next hole it told me to use my five iron. It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever. I made a least a birdie on all the rest of the holes, and all I had to do was listen to that frog.

That night I took the frog to the casino in my hotel. We played Roulette. I put my money where the frog said and won on every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I went up to bed. I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on the dresser. Suddenly it looked at me and said, kiss me. Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but it said it again. So I kissed the frog and it turned into the most beautiful fourteen year old girl you have ever seen in your entire life. And that your honor is how that fourteen year old girl ended up in my hotel room.

There was a little boy named Timmy. He was too young to shower by himself so he had to shower with his Mom.

One day he was showering with his mom as usual. He noticed her boobs and realized he didn't know what they were called. 

""Mommy,"" he asked

""What are those?"" he finished, pointing to her chest

""Oh Timmy,"" she said, ""these are Mommy's headlights.""

Timmy gave out an 'oh'. After a moment he turned to her again and pointed to her Vagina.

""Well Mommy, what is that?""

""That's just Mommy's garden, Timmy."" replied his mother. After, they finished up their shower like usual.

Some time after that, his Mom was busy running errands so he had to shower with his dad.

He knew he and his Dad both had a *thing*, but he didn't know what it is called. 

""Daddy,"" he asked, pointing to his Dads dick.

""What is that called?""

""Why Timmy,"" the Dad said after thinking a monent ""That is my snake.""

Timmy, now content in his new knowledge, finished up his as per usual.

Later that night, Timmy had a nightmare, and walked to his parents room to sleep in their bed because he was scared. They accepted and he climbed in to the foot of the bed. Though he tried to fall asleep, he was still scared, and a half hour had gone by. Suddenly, he felt the bed slightly shaking and noises coming from his parents. He crawled under the covers to investigate. His eyes needed a moment to adjust, but when he realized what he was seeing he was sent into a panic. 

""Mommy, Mommy! Turn on your headlights! There's a snake in your garden!""",A dirty joke my dad told me,8

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door. ""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",Long but has a great end,6

And I felt pretty bad for the little guy, maybe something terrible happened to him, maybe he was late for a birthday and wouldn't be able to pay the bills - who knows, right? I mean, I don't speak koala.

But this koala, he looked like he used to have clothes and then he didn't and he had this look, and I don't know how to really describe this look, it was just this look that connected me to this koala in a deep sense of mutual understanding, and this look told me that this koala's clothes were somewhere near by.

So me and this koala, we start looking for those clothes. We're searching all over, I'm scoring the streets and the sidewalks, looking under bushes and inside trashcans for a jean or a boot or anything because after a while I start feeling bad for this naked koala. Not only is he naked, but he's out here searching for clothes naked, it's just shameful you know? Like it lacks dignity, and there's nothing worse than an undignified koala. 

So anyway, we're searching fro clothes for like four hours and we're not finding anything (except for a tie, which obviously wasn't the koala's) so I plop down in this field and I'm thinking and I'm looking around and up in this tree I see this piece of blue fabric flapping in the breeze. So I point it out to this koala and his eyes light up and he's super stoked and he shoots up that tree, which is odd because koalas are usually pretty slothful, but not this guy, this guy's an entrepreneur, climbing trees and working birthdays. 

But he climbs up and up and up and way up this super huge tree, like I have no idea what this tree is even doing here is so much taller than everything else around it barely makes sense, but he gets up there and he gets his shirt and he puts it on and he comes back down and we have this moment, like another look moment where we're not speaking but I know exactly what he's thinking and it's ""how can I repay you?""

And the second I pick up what he's putting down I kind of give him the old ""phssha"", with the hand wave and the face and everything and I tell him, ""you don't have to worry about a thing, koala. I'm going to go on to /r/jokes and I'm going to type up this story and they're going to laugh and laugh and laugh and that'll be all the payment I ever need. And this koala, he looks at me in disbelief and he shoots a message deep in my mind, ""why o
