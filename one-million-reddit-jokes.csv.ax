He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,158

The head coach, Bob, knew the team needed a different approach next year. 

In the off season, Bob was driving around town when he saw a panhandler at a stoplight, and realized that this panhandler was around college age, and looked close to 7 feet tall. Bob stopped his car to talk to him and found out the panhandler, Louie, was a homeless orphan. Bob asked Louie if he was any good at basketball. Louie replied that he never got many chances to play, but he enjoyed it. 

Bob realized that Louie could be the solution to his problems, and that he could also give Louie a scholarship to help him get a home, an education, and a future. After seeing him practice, Bob realized that Louie was an undiscovered prodigy, and was a natural at basketball. His height allowed him to dominate on both ends of the floor. Bob and Louie agreed that Louie would be the team captain the next season. 

With Louie on the team, Indiana went undefeated through the regular season, and were a #1 seed headed into the NCAA Tournament. The whole state was excited to see if Louie could lead the team to a national championship. The story of Louie panhandling and being discovered by Bob was all over national news.

The day before their first game of the tournament, the head NCAA referee gave Bob a phone call. 

“I just heard on the news the story about you finding Louie,” the referee said, “and unfortunately, I can’t let him play in the tournament.”

Bob was furious. “What do you mean?! Why can’t he play???” Bob asked.

“Well,” replied the ref, “there’s actually an old rule that clearly states that Louie can’t play for your team. Everybody knows that beggars can’t be Hoosiers.”",The college basketball team at Indiana University had just finished their worst season in school history.,6

The California woodpecker then challenged the Hawaiian woodpecker to peck a tree in California that was absolutely im-peckable (a term woodpeckers like to use). The Hawaiian woodpecker expressed confidence he could do it, so accepted the challenge. After flying to California, the Hawaiian woodpecker successfully pecked the tree with no problem. 

So the two woodpeckers were now confused. How is it that the California woodpecker was able to peck the Hawaiian tree and the Hawaiian woodpecker was able to peck the California tree, but neither one was able to peck the tree in their own state? 

After much woodpecker-pondering, they both came to the same conclusion...

Your pecker is always harder when you're away from home.",A Hawaii woodpecker and a California woodpecker were arguing about which place had the toughest trees.,67

And that was perfect for Oskar, the burly Russian guide. He had been working as an outfitter and helping stragglers cross the treacherous mountains for years at this point. He knew the mountains like the back of his hand. While his English may not have been perfect, he was smart, loyal, and capable.

For Robert and Emily Wagner, this was the perfect man for the job, for their families had already left and made it to California in the months ahead of them. The newlyweds were not ready to leave Missouri as they did not wish to interrupt their honeymoon and first few months as a new couple. The time had come for them to leave, but no one was willing to cross the mountains in the dead of winter, knowing how dangerous the paths could be. And that's when they found Oskar. The only man willing to take the couple across the mountains and to their new home.

""Don't vorry,"" said Oskar, ""you and vife vill be good care taken. Vill chews many good foods in California.""

""Ah, yes,"" replied Robert, ""we hope to be eating fulls meals with our families soon!""

And so the three departed from the Midwest and set off for California, with Oskar guiding their steps the whole way. The first few weeks were nothing to speak of. Long days on the wagon and nights under a full sky of stars. It was getting colder, but nothing they couldn't manage with a few blankets and a warm fire.

Then it was time to cross the mountains. There were safe passes that would get them to California and to the land of sunshine, but it would be a few more weeks of crossing. The Wagners, impatient newlywed couple they were, asked Oskar if he did not know of a faster way. Canned meats and old beans were manageable, but their stomachs were growing tired of the same thing day in and day out and they wished to be in California as soon as possible.

Ever pragmatic, Oskar was unwilling to go along at first. He had already sent word of their arrival time weeks before they left with another wagon train. Were anything to happen to them, the Wagner's families would not be looking for them right away. The Hastings Cutoff, the quicker path, would save them almost a month on their journey if all went to plan, but that month could make or break them if it all went awry.

After needling and prodding their Russian guide, the Wagner's finally got their way. A whole month sooner in California! Fresh food and warm beds! And for Oskar, it meant more opportunity to get back to work with another group to guide. It was decided. They would taking the Hastings Cutoff and brave the mountain paths and the cold, cold winter skies.

At first, all seemed to being going to plan. They were making headway, and the dream of California was growing closer. And then, the snow descended.

While set up for camp one evening, the winds began to howl and the snow began to fall. And fall it did. First it was inches, then it was feet. Before they knew what could be done, they were locked in snow banks taller than three men. The mules had run off to seek their own shelter as the storm began. When Oskar managed to tunnel out of their snowy prison, he could see nothing but a blanket of white around them for as far as he could see. Without the mules to pull the wagon, they were stuck. And even with the animals, who knew how long it would be before the snow had melted off enough for them to move. Making the trek on foot was out of the question, they would not have enough food for the trip, having to carry it all on their backs, and a young woman in tow. They were stranded. The dream of California was suddenly looking very distant.

In the weeks that followed, their hopes were raised and dashed, raised and dashed. Just when the sun seemed to come out for long enough to possibly melt away their frozen prison, the clouds would descend and they would find inches more snow atop their icy tomb. With each glimpse of sun and further snowfall, the snow around them froze harder and harder as it melted and solidified. What seemed like a temporary setback was becoming far more dire.

It was after the second month that the food began to run out. They had hoped to cut a month off their trip, but being stranded for so long, they had not anticipated that their supplies would dwindle in this fashion. With each passing day the growl in their stomachs grew louder and the hollowness of their cheeks ever more apparent. They were starving and help was nowhere to be found.

Robert and Emily were in love. They were young and they were naive. And they had no one to blame but themselves for pressuring their guide into this horrible situation. As the days wore on and the hunger intensified, Emily grew weaker and weaker, but her love for Robert grew ever stronger. It was when she could barely raise herself to sit up that she spoke the words that would haunt Robert for the rest of his days.

""Robert, I am not going to make it. But you will. You need to eat, Robert.""

And with that, she grabbed Oskar's knife and slit her throat. In her weakened state, there was nothing the two men could do to save her. She bled out and died, leaving the two men with her last words hanging in the air between them.

For the first few days, Robert was inconsolable. He lay in a heap near Emily's body, whimpering and sobbing. His wife was gone and he was all alone in the world, trapped in an icy hell. But hunger will do terrible things to people. It finally became too much for him to handle. The emotional pain was ever present, but the physical pain in his stomach was becoming too much to bear. Emily's last words rang in his ears when he looked up at Oskar.

""We have to do it, Oskar. She will have died for nothing if we don't.""

Fate is cruel and fate is fickle. Not long after the men had consumed what they could to stay alive the sun finally came out and stayed out. How quickly their snowy hell became a sheet of ice solid enough to walk on. With the energy of full stomachs for the first time in weeks, it was decided they would push on, on foot. The disastrous newlyweds' families would surely be looking for them by now. They had been delayed so long, if only the two men could make it far enough along their route, perhaps they would find worldly salvation, having left heavenly salvation behind with the grisly choice they made with the young bride.

The hike on foot was treacherous, but manageable. They had food, as far as it could be described, in their packs and a willingness to survive. They carried on for two weeks in this fashion, dining on their regret and making headway. And then they saw it.

A fire! Someone else! Another human soul!

They approached the encampment and found the newlyweds' fathers with a group of cousins and siblings. They were saved! The rescue posse had set out not long after the arrival date of the newlyweds had come and passed. With no way of contacting them, they stayed out every night, eyes on the horizon, looking for their kin. Of course, the celebration was not long lived. Someone was obviously missing.

And with that, Robert broke down in front of the patriarchs of the family and told the tale of their plight. He wept uncontrollably, describing the grisly decision he and Oskar were forced to make in light of Emily's actions. A look of horror passed across the faces of the men in the group as they understood what they were hearing. Horror and disgust and a mixture of pure pity for this soul in front of them who had crossed a line no man ever wished to cross.

It was then that Robert's father looked over at Oskar, who had remained silent during the young man's tale of life saved by a life given. ""You too, Oskar? Did you...eat...her as well?""

And with that, Oskar hung his head. In all his years of guiding, he had never had to make a decision like the one he had made, trapped in the snow, high in the mountains, with a pain in his stomach like no pain he had felt in his many years on this earth. He looked up at the old men and answered:

""It is true. I also chews dis guy's dead vife.""",The journey to California in 1846 was a treacherous one,3

Inside the small boat were several large yellow-fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.  


The Mexican replied: “Only a little while.""  

&amp;#x200B;

The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? 

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican said he has enough to support his family’s immediate needs.

 The American then asked: “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”

&amp;#x200B;

The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”  


The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”  


To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”  


“But what then?” asked the Mexican.  


The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”  


“Millions – then what?”

     A store that sells new husbands has opened in Nashville, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:
       You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!
      So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:
   Floor 1- These men Have Jobs
        She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:
   Floor 2- These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.
         'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'
so she continues upward. The third floor sign reads
    Floor 3- These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.
        'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.
 She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:
    Floor 4- These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.
         'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'    Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:
     Floor 5- These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.
     She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:
     Floor 6- You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.

Problem was it was night shift and it was seriously cutting into their drinking habits.
That was until a Concorde landed and was taxied over to where they were working, and obviously Paddy had to go have a look and ended up under the wings. 
He called Shamus over after he noticed a slight smell and a dripping noise, Paddy ended up tracking it down to a leaking fuel tank and stood directly under the drip hoping to catch a bit in his hand. 
But Shamus took that exact moment to nudge him and Paddy got a big splash right onto his tongue. To say it caught him by surprise was like saying the Irish don’t drink.
Shamus was shocked when Paddy screwed up his face and turned a horrible shade of white, ‘Begorrah that’s got a kick like a mule!’ Yelled Paddy.
Well Shamus not to be outdone grabbed the mop bucket nearby and waited patiently until it had a few millimetres inside and skulled the precious fluid. He immediately tried to bring his hands up to his neck as his throat constricted but found them forced back by some invisible force. 
And that was the last thing he remembered, waking up the next day in a hospital bed with drips coming out of arm. What he couldn’t believe was that his nose was now twelve inches long and brilliant white and ending in a point. The nurse saw he was awake and bought a phone over to his ear, confused Shamus answered the mumbling on the other end. 
‘Shamus, Shamus is that you? It’s Paddy and I’m not sure where I am, are you alright laddie?’ Asked Paddy.
Shamus half heard him and couldn’t stop staring at his nose, but he replied, ‘Paddy, what happened to us? This is the work of the devil, I have a nose I can use for spear and I’m sure the nurses here painted me white!’
Paddy calmed him down and replied, ‘Twas the rocket fuel we drunk last night, you started running up and down the runway and flapping your arms and tried to rape a Cessna ya silly bugger!’ 
‘Well, I seem to remember you doing circles and started talking French, but where are you Paddy?’ Asked Shamus.
‘Last thing I remember was sitting on the airport throne with a cigarette and had to seriously fart and then a bright white light appeared!’ Paddy exclaimed, ‘ Now I have two French policeman and an airforce pilot claiming I violated airspace over Lyons!’",Airport Drinks.,1

Now Timmy loved growing up on the farm with his family. He enjoyed helping out in the fields, he loved feeding the sheep and cows, and he was always happy to help out in the barn. The one thing Timmy did not like, was having to clean out the outhouse. He absolutely hated that.

Now one day there was a massive storm. Rain was coming down in sheets and it lasted so long that the small river than ran next to the outhouse swelled up so high that the outhouse was only about a foot away from it. Little Timmy saw this and realized this could be his chance to get rid of the outhouse. 

He ran and got one of his dads shovels and some planks and quickly ran over to the side of the outhouse to dig away the dirt and lever it up with the planks. Finally, he gave it one last hard shove and the entire outhouse toppled into the river and drifted downstream.

Little Timmy was pretty happy with himself until later that night, while he was in the kitchen helping his mother make supper, his dad walked into the house. Now little Timmy saw his dads face, as his dad began to take off his belt, and knew the game was up, so he thought fast and decided his best chance was to immediately come clean.

""Pa.""

""Yes son""

"" I pushed the outhouse into the river""

""I know that son. Now bend over""

At this Little Timmy was taken aback, ""but pa, George Washington told how he cut down the cherry tree and he didn't get in trouble for it"".

His dad pauses for a moment, before replying ""son. George Washington's dad wasn't IN the cherry tree""",Little Timmy and the Outhouse,9

Paddy Flanagan is the first man in his small country town to buy a motorcycle and he takes his friend Seamus for a ride. 

They are buzzing along through the glens and hills when Seamus begs for a break. ""The wind is coming through my jacket and cutting me chest up."" Thinking quick, Paddy tells Seamus to turn his jacket around so it closes up the back and he won't have any more issues with the wind. ""Good idea,"" says Seamus as he turns his jacket around and they are on their way. 

Now a good ways from town, out beyond the pastures and dairies, Paddy stops to see how Seamus is feeling. At his shock, Seamus is missing from the back of the bike! Paddy turns around and heads back, where, a mile down the road, he sees a group of farmers standing in the middle of the street.

As he approaches, he sees Seamus laying motionless on the road. ""Aw shite,"" exclaims Paddy, ""is he alive?""

 ""Ay, he was,"" says one of the farmers. ""he was even talking to us, right up until we spun his head around the right way!""

(Stolen unashamedly from a comment on Quora)

Some years ago the Pope was visiting New Zealand as part of a world tour.

On a day when he had a few hours to spare he asked if he could be shown one of the famous beaches of New Zealand, so his hosts took him to a beautiful, secluded beach on the South Island.

As the Pope and his entourage were walking along the pristine sand, a sudden commotion in the water caught everyone’s attention—a man wearing a green and gold top was seen to be swimming furiously towards shore, with a great white shark in hot pursuit.

Just as it appeared that the Australian was about to be torn to pieces by the shark, a motor boat carrying four men wearing All-Black tops rounded the point.

They ran their boat directly at the shark and stabbed it with grappling hooks just before the shark reached the Australian. They then carefully lifted the man from the water and gently placed him on the bottom of their boat before turning the boat to go around the point again, with the shark in tow.

The Pope asked his entourage to get their attention—he wanted to talk to these heroic New Zealanders who had rescued a foreigner, and an Australian at that, from certain death.

As requested, the Kiwis turned their boat towards shore and glided gently up on the sand, next to where the Pope was standing.

His Holiness was effusive in his praise, saying that he had heard about possible bad relations between Australians and New Zealanders, but that their prompt action was an inspiration to all mankind, showing how people could live in peace and harmony, and selflessly help each other when help was needed.

After the Pope and his entourage left, one of the Kiwis asked: ‘Who the heck was that?’

One of his mates replied: ‘That was the Pope. He has direct communication with God and knows all there is to know about doctrinal matters’.

‘Well’, said his companion, ‘he knows stuff all about shark fishing. Anyway, is that bait still all right, or do we need to get another one?’",New Zealand Humor,15

One day he rented out his boat to a group of out-of-staters who sank it. Joe spent all day trying to salvage as much stuff as he could and was out of touch all that day and most of the evening. Unbeknownst to him, his brother John’s wife died suddenly.

When he got back on shore he went into town to pick up a few things at the grocery. A kind old woman there mistook him for John and said:

“I’m so sorry for your loss. You must feel terrible.”

Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat said:

“Hell no! Fact is I’m sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish. She was always holding water. She had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn’t very good and smelled bad. But they wanted her anyway. The damn fools tried to get in her all at one time and she split right up the middle…”.",Joe and John were identical twins.,138

Sharon &amp; Tracey are walking home from the pub one night.

As they turn the corner, they come across a circus in the field over the road that has closed up for the night. One of the main attractions, a huge 12 foot tall bull elephant with a 6 foot long penis could clearly be seen quietly eating hay in it's enclosure.

The girls, who had clearly had a skinful of booze start staring and laughing loudly at such a site.

Tracey - ""Look at the size of that cock!!, Imagine having something that large inside you.""

Sharon - ""Go on then, I dare you. Have a bash on it.""

So Tracey asks Sharon to act as lookout whilst she sneaks into the enclosure for some very inappropriate action.

15 minutes later Tracey comes staggering back ""Fuckin' hell Sharon you've got to have a bang on that, I've never felt so filled, it was amazing""

Excitedly, Sharon climbs into the elephant enclosure to get some of her own action.

Afterwards he showered and went downstairs.  There Mrs. Jones had prepared a fine array of foods: eggs, sausages, waffles, etc.  To top it all off was a freshly made cappuccino with a small origami crane folded from a single dollar bill.

Still reeling a bit from the shock of the morning John said ""This has been simply amazing but I really must ask, why the dollar bill?""

Mrs Jones replied ""Last night I told my husband that today was your last day and asked him what we should get you.""  He replied..

When I continued to ignore him, he got more vulgar, and began to insult me personally. Finally throwing in a shot at my mother.

I looked up at him, and said...

Mary, the girl behind the counter,  was almost 20 and knew what they were for. She could see that I was  really embarrassed because I turned red and started stuttering.

When Mary handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one, I said ‘No, not really.'

So she unwrapped the package, took one out, and slipped it over her  thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure.

Mary could tell that I was still confused, so she looked all around the  store to see if there were any other customers. Then she said 'Just a  minute,' and walked me into the storage room. Then Mary took off her  blouse and bra and said ‘Do these excite you?'

Well, I was so  dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and  nod my head. Mary told me to put the condom on, and then she dropped her  skirt, took off her panties and laid down on a desk.

'Well, come  on', Mary said, 'We don't have much time.' So I climbed on her and it  felt so incredible that I couldn’t hold back and KAPOW, I was done in  less than a minute.

Mary looked at me with a big frown and said,  'Did you put that condom on?' she asked. I said, 'sure did,' and held up  my thumb to show her.

His wife, who is a little thick and well rounded, wakes up, goes to the bathroom and gets naked to take a bath. Just before she got in, she decided to take a quick detour to do the number 1. 

Just as the husband is about to leave, his wife's screams make him run to the bathroom. There she is, sitting in the toilet, completely nude... and stuck. No matter how hard he pulls, how much she wiggles her derrière, no luck, she's completely glued to the thing. 

\-I'll have to call the building's janitor, I got the meeting with the supervisor today, I cannot spend the whole morning here trying to help you!

\-Are you nuts? You cannot leave me here alone! I'm nude, give me something to cover myself before he gets here! Hurry up!

He then goes inside, makes some calls and it's trying to arrange everything when the doorbell rings. Unable to think of something else, he takes the sombrero from the wall where it was as decoration and gives it to his wife so she can cover. He opens the door and tells the janitor that he has to be completely discrete and professional about the situation. The janitor enters the bathroom as he tries his best to remain calmed.

\-Well sir, have to tell you... I can free your wife, she will probably be fine. I might have to break the toilet, so please have that in mind because we're going to need a replacement as soon as possible... Now...

At that moment the janitor goes silent. The husband looks at him worried.

Knowing I could trust the shoes, I next asked them to take me to get a gift for my wife. It was our anniversary.

The shoes walked me right into a jewelry store, and stopped in front of a beautiful necklace. I bought it.

Happy with my purchase, I asked the shoes to walk me home. There I gave the gift to my wife; she said it was beautiful, and told me she loved me very much.

However, I wasn't done yet. It was a sinful, awful thought, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation:  lastly I asked the shoes to take me to the best hooker in town.

This time, however, the shoes failed me: they led me to a church, where a priest was giving a sermon on the 6th Commandment.

A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your laundry in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung at me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" he replied with a cheeky grin, “He choked on a sock.""",Old but gold,26

So they sit in front of this therapist and the therapist says “the problem is obvious. I know how to help. You need to search at Craigslist for a specific kind of man. He needs to be tall, athletic and needs to have a dick that makes a horse feel jealous. If you find such a guy, tell him to get naked and swing his dick round-round standing next to the bed while you have sex with your wife. I am 100% sure your wife will get her orgasm!” The old guy asks confused “You sure this works?” “It will!”

So they search via Craigslist for such a guy and wonder-wonder after a few days they receive a phone call and it is exactly the kind of man the therapist has recommended. So they tell him what he should do whilst they are occupied with sex. 

They tried immediately the following night. The old guy is treating is wife and the athletic guy is standing naked doing the cock helicopter next to the bed. And what do you think happened? Nothing. After 1 hour of desperate sex the wife still does not have an orgasm. 

Angry they visit they therapist once again and want to get back their money. 
The therapist tells them “Calm down. We still have a better option! The next time we do it the other way around. YOU stand naked close to the bed swinging your penis round-round and the athletic guy is taking care of your wife! I am sure this will work if you try your best!”

They agree, call the other guy and so the upcoming evening they try what the therapist recommended.

And the tall athletic guy starts to fuck the shit out of the wife whilst the old one is standing naked close to the bed doing the cock helicopter. And after 30 minutes of the wildest fuck ever seen the wife cums with a never ending scream! So the tall guy and the wife fall exhausted into the bed, the wife’s body still shaking. 

The old husband leaves his position, walks round the bed naked to the tall one laying there and bends down to his face and yells “Look, motherfucker! That’s how you swing your dick!!!!!!”

The man took a basket of grapes with him to the room. The couple changed into their birthday clothes. The boy kept a grape on his wife's love canal and devoured it out of the canal in one go. The groom's father was secretly watching them from a small crevice in the room.

The groom's father decided to try it out on his wife. He informed his wife that he was going out to get some grapes. His wife asked him to get some apples instead. The man ignored. He came back sometime later with a bag of grapes. The old man led his wife into their bedroom. The old man was excited to replicate the experiment he had just seen.

They changed into their birthday clothes and the old man placed a grape on his wife's canal. A moment later the grape disappeared, before he could devour it. He was surprised as to where the grape went. ""Must have dropped it"", he thought to himself and proceeded to place another grape, which to his surprise again, disappeared in thin air. His wife was smiling all the while. Finally, she spoke- ""Well, this is why I asked you to get apples instead.""",Replication of a Bed Experiment,1

The teacher said to the student in the back, ""Stop that right now, or I will alert the principal!"" The anonymous student replied to her, ""I didn't do anything wrong, everything I said was perfect!""  Pedro frantically yelled at the top of his voice, ""Donald Trump, 2020."" 

The teacher stormed out of the class to get the principal, and as the classmates looked at each other, someone said, ""Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble now!"" Pedro whispered, ""Saddam Hussein, 2003."" 

Finally someone throws an eraser at Pedro to get him to shut up, while someone else yells ""Duck""! Pedro calls out, ""Dick Cheney 2006!""",It was the first day of school...,160

The therapist said ""Did you have sex before you were married?"" 

And they both shook their heads no. He then said ""Alright, this may be uncomfortable for you, but I'll need you to videotape yourselves having sex. Let's see what we're working with.""

The couple were uncomfortable at the thought, but were determined to help their marriage and showed up next week with the tape. 

After watching it, the therapist said ""You two are both so stiff, so formal! You need to have fun with each other! First, get a bunch of grapes and a box of donuts. John, the next time I want you to take some grapes and place them into Rebecca's vagina. Slowly eat them out of her one by one. And Rebecca, take a donut and place it around John's penis, and slowly eat it off of him. Once you learn to relax around each other, everything will be fine.""

John and Rebecca went home and that night had the best sex of their lives. They were so happy they told their friends Rob and Amy, and raved about how much he'd helped them. The next day, Rob and Amy arrived at the therapist's office and explained their problem. Once again, the therapist recommended they record themselves.

The week after, the therapist sat down infront of Rob and Amy, handed over the tape, and said ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do to help you."" 

""But doctor!"" cried Rob ""You helped John and Rebecca! Please, you have to do something for us!"" 

The therapist looked at them for a long moment, then heaved a large sigh. ""Alright. First, get a bag of apples and a box of cheerios...""",John and Rebecca were newlyweds,2

When his friend arrives, the country boy tells him, ""We'll head out to my uncle James' place. He's got a big spread and won't mind if we do some hunting on it.""

 So they head out and upon arrival, the country boy steps inside to speak with his uncle while the cityslicker waits in the truck.

 Uncle James is happy as can be to see his nephew, and readily agrees to let him and his friend hunt on his property, but has a request of him.

 ""My old mule, Bessie, ""the uncle says, ""She's been doing poorly, and the vet says she's suffering. Could you put her down for me? I haven't got the heart to do it.""

 The nephew agrees to do it, and on his way back out to the truck, he decides he's going to have some fun with his cityslicker friend. He hops into the truck, slams the door, and starts beating his hands against the steering wheel.

 ""Do you believe that old motherfucker said we couldn't hunt on his property!"" he yells. ""After all I've done for that son of a bitch, he says 'No! You can't hunt on my land! Now get your ass and that cityslicker friend of yours off my property before I call the law!'.

 He then cranks up the truck and goes blazing back down the dirt road. Just up ahead, he sees ole' Bessie in the field. Pulling off to the side, he jumps out, grabs his rifle and screams ""I'll show that fucker!"". 

He takes aim, and BOOM! Bessie drops to the ground dead.

 As he turns to see the look on his friend's face, he hears BOOM - BOOM - BOOM!

The  man looks at the barkeep and says ""If I can show you the most amazing  thing you've ever seen, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the night?""  
The barkeep thinks about it for a moment and says ""Sounds  interesting but I warn you that I'm not easily impressed. Lets see it then"".  
The man reaches into his bag an produces a tiny, perfect piano and a stool.  
The barkeep admires the craftsmanship and says ""Cool toy but I'm not into doll houses"".  
The  man raises a finger of acknowledgement and reaches back into his bag  before producing a dwarf hamster dressed in a tiny tuxedo and places it  gently onto the stool.  
""Cute,"" says the barkeep ""but I've seen better"".  
The  man feeds a sunflower seed to the hamster and after stuffing it into  his cheek the hamster turns to the piano and starts to play some of the most beautiful music the barkeep has ever heard.  
""Wow"" says the wide eyed barkeep ""That's pretty good, but I've seen better.""  
The man lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches deeper into his bag before producing a big green frog and sitting it on the bar next to the hamster and his piano. The barkeep raises an eyebrow as the man bends down and appears to whisper something to the hamster before handing over two seeds. The hamster gleefully stuffs the seeds into its mouth before striking up a different tune on the piano and as if by magic the frog  starts singing the most sonorous and powerful operatic performance in  time with the piano.  
By this point a crowd of stunned onlookers has gathered around the bar, the barkeep can't believe the spectacle taking place in front of his eyes and as soon as the performance finishes he turns to the man and says ""That's incredible, your drinks are on the house"".  
The man orders a beer and starts to carefully put the show  back in his bag. The barkeep returns with his order and says ""Look, I'd  be a fool if I didn't ask if you could be tempted into selling your little show, how much do you want for it?  
The man sips his beer and replies politely ""Sorry, the creatures are my pets and I won't sell  them"" before moving to a corner table for the rest of the evening where  he quietly enjoys his free beers by himself.  
The night eventually  draws to a close and the barkeep rings the bell for last orders. The man returns to the bar to order a final drink, the memory of that show has  been twirling around the barkeeps mind all night and as he returns with the mans order he decides to make one last offer.  
""I know you said  they weren't for sale but I've got $2000 worth of tips upstairs that I  was saving, it's obvious you've got no money otherwise you'd not be making deals in bars like this so how about it, can we make a deal?"" He  says to the man.  
The man takes a big sip of his beer and looks into space as if deep in thought. After a moment he sighs deeply and says  ""Well, I'm trying to get to the big city where I can make some real  money but things are getting pretty tight on the road and the show's not worth anything if I never make to the big city at all so I guess we can talk"".  
The man reaches into his bag and puts the ensemble back on the bar where he sits and studies them while mumbling quietly to himself  about years, numbers, training and occasionally counting on his  fingers. He eventually stops, takes a deep breath and begins to explain.  
""Well  the piano took me 4yrs to build and several hundred in materials so that's off the table straight away, the hamster took 5yrs to train and  has been a well mannered, loyal friend on the road and I don't think I could part with him but the frog has only been with me for a year and  has been foul mouthed and nothing but trouble so I potentially be  tempted to offload him for just a little bit more. I'm not a fool and I  know what these creatures are worth.""  
The barkeep ponders this for a  moment before disappearing upstairs and returning with the jar of tips,  he places it on the bar and opens the cash register, he counts out another $500 and pushes the money towards the man. ""$2500 should take  you anywhere in the country first class, it's yours for the frog.""  
The  man looks pained for a moment and stares at the frog before looking at the cash, he looks back and forth a few times trying to make his  decision before eventually saying ""Deal"" and tucking the money into his  bag.  
""Great!"" says the barkeep ""A pleasure doing business with you"".  
The  man takes one long last look at the frog before walking towards the  exit. As he proceeds an elderly patron who had been watching them all  evening gets up and follows him out the door.  
""Excuse me"" the patron says ""Could you hold on a minute?""  
""Sure, what's up?"" say the man.  
""I  just wanted a final look at the stupidest man on earth as he parts with  his fortune!"" sneers the elderly man ""You could have made millions with  that little show of yours!""  
""Yeah I do kinda feel like a dick, I should've-"" The man starts to reply  
""You should feel like a dick!"" The old patron interrupts ""You should have  thought about the big picture, you kids these days never thi-""  
The man reaches up and gently presses a finger to the old patrons lips silencing him.  
""I should have told him that the hamster is a ventriloquist.""",My favourite disappointing joke,8

Long one so get ready..

A young guy goes to purchase an old motorcycle from an old timer. When he arrives he's floored at how clean and spotless the bike is. It's flawless. He asks the old gentleman how he has kept this 40 year old bike in such great condition. Just then it starts to drizzle a bit. The old man takes out a jar of Vaseline and wipes down the whole bike. He states it's his secret for keeping it spotless and asks the young man to keep his secret safe and to always wipe it down before a rain. The young man promises he will. Deal done and the old man even throws in his jar of Vaseline.

  Later that evening he takes his motorcycle over to meet his girlfriends parents for the first time. Walking up to the house his girlfriend warns "" We have a weird sort of tradition in our house, we don't speak a word during dinner otherwise you have to do all the dishes.""  Odd but just then a smoking hot girl answers the door and introduces herself as the younger sister, Dad seems nice and introduces Mom, who is also very good looking. 

 Some small talk and it's time for dinner. The young man walks into the kitchen to help serve dinner and is shocked. No one has done the dishes for what seems months! Dirty plates stacked to the ceiling. It's a mess. He brings the food to the table thinking "" I'm not going to say a word!""

 Dinner is actually good and he just smiles along. His girlfriend starts to play footsie with him, then starts feeling his inner thigh. He's getting excited but realizes this maybe just a ploy to get him to speak. He's not falling for it! She then goes under the table and starts to give him a blow job right at Dinner!! He's so confused but also so turned on. The family notices but says nothing, they just keep eating. Mom is visibly getting turned on and the younger sister is too! 

  The girlfriend comes back up from under the table and takes off her pants, they start banging right on the table! ""This is insane"" he thinks but is so turned on he can't stop. He bangs the girlfriend, then the mom, and even the sister all while nothing is being said!!  The dad just keeps eating the whole time! 
 Just then the young guy looks out the dining room window and notices it's starting to drizzle, so he whips out the Vaseline.  ""Fine! Fuck it I'll do the dishes!""  yells the dad.",Dishes,40

When they arrive today they see a sign that says ""under new management"". Apprehensive at first, they decide to eat there anyway. Why break tradition now, right? 

The hostess seats them and the waiter comes for their order. 
""Here's da menya, you know what you ta drink?"" 

Abraham speaks up first and says ""three waters and we're ready to order. I'll take the fish, Lou will have the steak and Martin will want the chicken.""

The waiter nods once and heads to the kitchen while the three friends catch up. 

Shortly there after the first dish arrives. The waiter asks "" who had da fish?"" 
Abraham speaks up and takes his plate, and the waiter leaves. Then Abraham marvels at what is before him. The most dry and burnt attempt at cooking he'd ever seen. In fact he could hardly believe it ever was a fish unless there were wild charcoal salmon swimming somewhere he'd never heard of. 

Before he could even voice his complaints the waiter was back.
""And da chicken."" the waiter again takes off as soon as Martin grabs his plate. 
Martin looks at his plate of chicken in shock. In front of him is the most poorly cut, undercooked, and (most importantly) bloody mess that he'd ever even heard of. He was confident that there would have been less blood if the chef had come out there and killed the chicken right there on his plate. 

Lou is trying to take in all that he's seeing spread out on the table and he just starts shaking. Then before he can even express his feelings, the waiter is back. 

Before he can get a word out, Lou jumps up and shouts ""NOPE! We're getting out of here!""

The waiter looks on confused. 

Lou continues "" I thought my nightmares were over but after seeing what you did to da fish and da chicken, I don't even want to imagine what fresh, gruesome, and fiery torture you've got planned with Dachau!""",3 old friends were having their annual Holocaust remembrance dinner,0

The elderly couple appears pleased.

But the lawyer's brow furrows a bit, and he says, ""I hope you won't mind my getting personal right out of the gate here, but... I have to ask... how old are you?""

The man says, ""I'm 96, and my wife is 91.""

The lawyer chews on this for a second. He then says, ""I hope you won't mind my mentioning this, but I have to say, I've never seen... I mean, it's most unusual that..."" Then he blurts out, *""Why did you wait so long?""*
