""There it is! That's the shrimp!"" Johnny exclaimed, pointing between her legs.

Johnny's parents were mortified, and scrambled to find the words to explain the situation. 

""Uhh, Johnny.. That's um.. Well.... You know.. Well you don't but uhh.."", Dad stammered.

""It's your Grandma's clitoris Johnny, NOT a shrimp"" Mom chimed in. ""I'm sorry you had to see that sweetie, let's get you back in bed.""

One day he goes over and stands by a beautiful boat, powered by a motor. This boat was amazing. It had a small cabin inside with a luxurious bed. It was divine.

While he was stood there, an equally beautiful blonde big breasted woman, with two small dogs on leads, walked up and asked ""Excuse me, is that your boat?""
Shocked by the size of this woman's breasts, he managed to stutter out the words ""Uh y-yeah. Wanna come in?""

After processing what he had just said, the man had an internal facepalm. Before he could correct himself, the woman picked up her dogs and hopped on. 
After going on himself, and realising he couldn't start this thing without the keys, he felt determined to get the boat started. After all, what would this beautiful woman think of him if he didn't?

He looked all over for the keys, but it was to no avail. He decided to hotwire the boat. He needed to make this woman happy. 

Just as he had finished starting the engine, he heard a shout, and it was coming closer. He started up the engine and shot off with the boat.

During the ride, he and the woman got closer, and eventually she asked him if they wanted to go to the bedroom, and he could have his way with her. And he did.

Upon arriving back at the slip, my friend was greeted by four policemen and the owner of the boat. He was arrested, and as there was no one else he was close to, I went to post his bail.

On the journey back, I asked him what drove him to do what he did. 
And he said: ""I just had to motorboat those puppies!""",My friend worked at a dockyard,2

The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explained the trial to him.""You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten.""

They go home with the horse and make it stay in the living room.

One of the friends pull out a bong and they all take hits until they're stoned.

While stoned they come up with an idea to have fun with the horse.

They attach a feeding muzzle onto the horse and funnel in smoke from the bong.

Eventually, they detach muzzle the horse and the horse's eyes get bloodshot, it is visibly high.

As a consequence, the horse starts talking:

""You have awakened me"", the horse says.

The stoners, shocked, reply, ""whoa, you can talk?"" In unison.

The horse proceeds to tell them that they must jerk him off or die.

The first stoner says ""nuh-uh, i aint like that"", and the horse mauls him and chews his face, killing him slowly.

The second stoner tries to escape, screaming ""Id rather die than jerk off a horse!""

The horse opens a safe, takes out a shotgun, and unloads a shell into the second stoner, making him slowly bleed out to death.

The third stoner, horrified, approaches the horse and fulfills the act until the horse is finished. The horse then spares the third stoner, and leaves him a diamond worth a great fortune.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should get off your high horse.

They visit the Reptile House, Monkey Island, Chimpanzee Forest, and the Avian Habitat. As they're walking toward the exit, they pass the Elephant Sanctuary. 

Little Johnny points to the elephant and says, ""Mommy, what's that thing hanging down from the elephant?""

The mother replies, ""That's the elephant's trunk, dear.""

Johnny points again and says, ""No, that OTHER thing!""

The mom's starting to get a little nervous, but she replies, ""Oh, that's the elephant's TAIL.""

Somewhat frustrated, Little Johnny says, ""No - that OTHER thing, hanging down between the elephant's legs!""

Mom, in a hurry to get to the car before rush hour (and, just a little embarrassed and not wanting to get into an anatomy lesson), says, ""Oh, that's nothing.""

The next day, she has to work and the dad has the day off. She tells him that they ran out of time at the zoo, and there was still a lot more for Little Johnny to see, so Dad takes him back to the zoo.

They visit the Komodo dragons, the Zebras, the Lions and Tigers and Bears (oh, my).  Finally, they walk by the Elephant Sanctuary.

Little Johnny points to the elephant and says, ""Daddy, what's that thing hanging down from the elephant?""

The father replies, ""That's the elephant's trunk, bud.""

He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can. The sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.
The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.
After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.
The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.”
The man asks, “Why not?”
And the sheriff replies, “Because this is the punch line.”",A rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.,379

""I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, ""What's 2+2""? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, ""10101000101"", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. 
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you.""

All of London was full of pigeon poop, the people of London could not walk on the pavements or drive on the roads. It was costing a fortune to keep the streets and pavements clean. 

One day a man came to the Town Hall and offered the Mayor a proposition. *'I can rid your beautiful city of its plague of pigeons without any cost to  the city. But, you must promise not to ask me any questions. Or, you can pay me one million pounds to ask one question.'*

The mayor considered the offer briefly and accepted the free proposition.

The next day the man climbed to the top of the Nelson's Column, opened his coat, and released a blue pigeon. The blue pigeon circled in the air and flew up into the bright blue London sky. All the pigeons in London saw the blue pigeon and gathered up in the air behind the bird. The London pigeons followed the blue pigeon as she flew eastwards out of the city. 

The next day the blue pigeon returned completely alone to the man on top of Nelson's Column. The Mayor was very impressed. He felt the man and the blue pigeon had performed a wonderful miraculous service to rid London of the plague of pigeons.

Even though the man with the pigeon had charged nothing, the mayor presented him with a check for 1 million pounds and told the man that, indeed, he did have a question to ask and even though they had agreed to no fee and the man had rid the city of pigeons, he decided to pay the 1 million just to get to ask ONE question. 

The man accepted the money and told the mayor to ask his ONE  question.

I stooped down to try to pick him up when I realized his entire body was stiff. And stone cold. I froze. Breathing heavily and trying to collect my thoughts, I tried to get the attention of the guy standing in front of him, when the same thing happened!

Now I was getting really freaked out. I tried the guy in front of *that* guy, and the same thing happened again. Now this was just plain weird. Now the place was dark so I couldn't really see anything properly at this point, so I took out my phone and used my flashlight too look at them properly. 

They were made of plastic. All of them.

Then I feel a light tap on my shoulder. It's Phil. ""What the fuck is the meaning of all this, Phil!?"" I yelled. Phil paused for a moment, and burst out in hysterical laughter.

""You're hilarious, Arlon!"" He said, once he had recovered. ""That's the fake one!""",I was at Phil's Halloween party the other day...,5

“Very good,” said the teacher.

Little Vicky was next: “I sold magazines,” she said, “I made $45 and I explained to everyone that magazines would keep them up on current events.”

“Very good, Vicky,” said the teacher.

Eventually, it was Little Joey’s turn. The teacher held her breath.

Little Joey walked to the front of the classroom and dumped a box full of cash on the teacher’s desk. “$2,467,” he said.

“$2,467!” cried the teacher, “What in the world were you selling”

“Toothbrushes,” said Little Joey.

“Toothbrushes,” echoed the teacher, “How could you possibly sell enough tooth brushes to make that much money?”

“I found the busiest corner in town,” said Little Joey, “I set up a Dip &amp; Chip stand, I gave everybody who walked by a free sample.”

They all said the same thing, “Hey, this tastes like dog crap!”

Jesus wakes up after a long time of sleeping. He hears two of his followers shout, ""My Lord, it is time for your second coming!"" He sits up and feels the wounds on his hands and feet ache. He groans and goes up to his mirror. 
By this time, Jesus had grown quite a beard from being asleep. So he reaches for his razor and tries to grab it, but he recoils, thinking about his hands. He grabs it with force and groans with pain. While shaving, Jesus asks his servants, ""do the humans really need a second coming, after all they did to me?"" 
The servants say quickly, ""why, of course, my Lord! They have been waiting thousands of years!""
Jesus ignores them and asks, ""what time is it?""
""It's January 30th, 1933, my lord,"" says one of the servants.
Jesus suddenly stopped shaving. His beard was gone, but he had his hair, styled as an undercut, and a small, thin, greasy black mustache that was not shaven. He put his razor down, washed his face, and declares....

Although initially hesitant the two holy men gave it a chance. 

At the first strip club the bachelors group is stopped from entering, with the explanation that they cannot go in if the priest and the rabbi are with them.

 The leave but the best man has an idea that the bouncer must think it’s a bit disturbing if two men in holy vestments enter strip bar … so maybe if they changed out of said vestments maybe they will be let in. So the holy men change, and yet still they are stopped at the door with the bouncer explaining that there is no use hiding and that they can’t go in. 

So the group go with their back up plan, but sure enough the group is stopped at the door, with a firm rejection explaining that they can’t come in if the holy men follow. Upon leaving they are given a further explanation that no peep show to brothel will serve them as long as the two holy men are in their party.

 At this point the groom makes a comment that it must be Gods will that prevents them from entering these places. 

The priest chimes in that he doubts this as just a week ago God was perfectly fine in letting him and rabbi go place to place …
 
The best man asks them what they did to get such response from all of these establishments.

The rabbi explains that last week they went place to place, providing lectures on Old Testament and the bible to the employees of these establishments, in attempt to get the girls out of these houses of ill repute and back on the path of rightness and God.

Best man then reasons that maybe if they made promise to not lecture at the door they will get a chance to get in.

To which the priest replies that they better get pretty drunk at the bar first as their lectures didn’t work on the ugly ones.

As he watched, Moses saw the rabbi Ben Simmons playing the best game he had ever played. The rabbi got a hole-in-one on the toughest hole on the course and then again on the next hole.

Moses turned to God and asked, 'I thought you were going to punish him. Do you call this punishment?'

Henry replied, “Vicky that helicopter is 50 dollars -- and 50 dollars is 50 dollars"".

The pilot overheard the couple and said, ""Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word I won't charge you! But if you say one word, it's 50 dollars.""

Henry and Vicky agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word. When they landed, the pilot turned to Vicky and said, ""By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm impressed!""

""That's perfect!"" Donald exclaims. ""It's one of the very best haircuts around, believe me. It's a tremendous improvement and I'm very proud of it!"" 

Donald heads out into New York City to show off his fancy new hairdo. He strikes up a conversation with a woman in a flowery dress, and after a few minutes notices that she doesn't seem to recognize him. Seeing an opportunity to get an inside look on his popularity with the female voters, he asks her, ""so who do you want to win this election?"" 

""Certainly not Trump!"" exclaims the woman. ""He's a sexist pig who treats women terribly. I hope he never sets one foot in the White House."" 

Trump is flabbergasted, but stumbles onward and tries to shake it off. He sees a black woman in sweatpants walking around and decides to see how he fares with the black working class. 

""Excuse me!"", Trump calls out. ""I was wondering if I could ask who you want to win this election?"" 

""Definite not that racist pig, Trump!"", the woman retorts. 

Donald is now visibly upset and sulks about throughout the city, unable to shake off the two blows to his ego. There, in the street, he spots his dear wife, Melania. Desperate for support, he approaches her. 

""Mrs. Trump!"", Donald calls out. ""May I ask who you are rooting for this election?"" 

Melania lets out a long sigh. She says, ""Don't tell anyone this, but I can't wait for my husband to lose to Hillary so we can get on with our lives. He's horribly unqualified, he's making us look bad, and he's dragging his family down with him."" 

This is too much for Trump to hear, and he runs off into the streets, denouncing his candidacy and thereby dropping out of the election. 

That evening, CNN's Anderson Cooper is covering this groundbreaking news, and announces that three guests will be speaking out about Trump's withdrawal. The woman in the flowery dress, the black woman in sweatpants, and Melania Trump appear on screen. 

Cooper addresses the woman in the dress. ""Ma'am, how do you feel about this shocking turn of events?"" 

The woman cackles and replies, ""What? Don't you recognize me? It's me, Hillary Clinton! I decided to ditch the pantsuit today, and I am thrilled to hear that my opponent has dropped out."" 

Cooper is shocked. ""Oh, Secretary Clinton, my apologies!"". 

Trying to recover, he addresses the black woman. ""Ma'am, what's your take on this fascinating turn of events?"" 

The black woman snappily responds, ""What, don't you recognize me? It's me, Michelle Obama! Can't I go one day without dressing my best? And yes, I'm so happy to hear that racist, Mr. Trump, has finally dropped out of this election."" 

Flustered, Anderson Cooper turns to Melania Trump. ""Mrs. Trump, how do you feel about your husband dropping from the election?"" 

Melania looks shocked and says, ""What, don't you recognize me? It's me, Michelle Obama!""",Donald Trump goes for a haircut...,0

The teacher came over and asked what was going on. The boy told the teacher he wrote the girl a note and she slapped him.

 The teacher asked, ""What did the note say?""

The boy responded with, ""I love you with a purple passion.""

The teacher highly offended sent the boy to the principal's office.

The principal asked why the boy was there. The boy relayed the story.The principal asked, ""What did the note say?""

The boy responded with, ""I love you with a purple passion.""

The principal highly offended expelled the boy from school and sent him straight home.

When the boys father got home he asked why the boy was expelled. The boy relayed the story about the note. ""Well, what did the note say?""

Again the boy responded with, ""I love you with a purple passion.""

Furious the father kicked the boy out of his house saying he did not have a son.

Years later the boy is living on the street and decides to make something with his life. He applies for a job at a fast food joint. The manager asks why he never completed school. With a sigh the boy tells the story of his life.

Thinking this was ludicrous the manager asks, ""Ok I'll bite what did the note say""

""I love you with a purple passion""

The manager yells, ""Get the hell out of here and never come back!""

The boy walks out the door and sees the girl across the street. He is determined to find out what was wrong with the note. He walks across the street and BAM he is hit by a bus and killed.

Morale of the story: Look both ways before crossing the street.

post,571wo0,2qh72,jokes,false,1476239365,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/571wo0/a_duck/,self.jokes,,"A man and his son live alone on a failed farm, the man turns to hi son and says, ""Son, I need to take this duck into town and sell it for the highest amount you can.""

The son nods and quickly takes the duck into town. As he is walking through the streets a young woman spots him and calls him over. The woman says, ""That is a mighty fine duck you have there, I'll give you a fuck for that duck!""

The boy quickly agrees, the sex was worth far more than a few bucks for the duck. They lock the door and quickly get at it in the back of the small store.

After they are finished the girl turns to him and says, ""That was amazing! I will give you your duck back for another fuck!"" The boy nods and they do it once more. 

After they are finished once again the boy gets dressed and turns to the girl. ""That was amazing, but I really need to sell this duck!"" The girl stops him and continues chatting with him, trying to lure him back for a third time.

As they are chatting the duck wanders into the street and gets hit by a semi, the boy runs out and sees the duck as a bloody skidmark. The truck driver gets out in a panic. ""OH god, that must of been your prize duck! I am so sorry, here! Take $20,000 it's all of the cash I have on me! I am so sorry!"" The man says before driving away.

The son soon returns home and meets with the father.

""Well, Son, how'd you do?""

The boy looks at him and says, ""Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and $20,000 for a fucked up duck.""

((My father told me this joke when I was 11, I wasn't suppose to remember it, so I recited that joke to myself for years.))\
