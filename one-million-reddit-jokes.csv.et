I’ll show you a few traits of how people with the low educational level act.

They can’t express themselves clearly. What they’re trying to say is always so vague and hard to understand. It’s like they don’t even have the vocabulary to talk about how they are feeling.

They are moody. One moment they are cheerful, the next they are crying and nagging for no reason. They can only solve problems by crying and screaming. The worst thing is that they act like this even in public because they just don’t give a shit.

They are stubborn. They refuse to accept people’s word. They simply dismiss logic and completely ignore what people say. This is a nightmare when combined with the above one.

They have quite short attention spans. They are enthusiastic in the beginning, but give up easily when facing obstacles. They ask you to buy something for them only because they want it, but end up discarding it after using only a few times.

That’s just the tip of the iceberg, and I learned all these from my girlfriend.

That being said, I still think she’s adorable.

I wanted to get to know the new priest at my church.
u/FallenAngel113
My priest and I agreed to go fishing. We sat there talking and waiting for a bite until, finally, the priest snagged a large fish. As I helped him pull it out of the water I said,""This is a big son of a bitch.""

The priest stopped, ""Son, why such salty language?""

Wanting to save face I quickly replied, ""No, Father, that's the name of that fish. It's a Sonofabitch fish.""

The priest was relieved and we began walking back to the rectory and a nun met us at the door. The priest greeted her and said, ""Check out the Sonofabitch I just caught.""

The nun, shocked, exclaimed, ""Father, never in my life-""

The priest interrupted her and said, ""No, Sister, that's the name. It's a Sonofabitch fish.

The nun was relieved and took the fish to be gutted. After gutting the fish, she brought it out back where the Deacon was heating up the grill. The nun said, ""Deacon, here, I gutted this Sonofabitch for you.""

The Deacon, shaking his head, said, ""Sister, that language is unbecoming.""

The nun replied, ""No Deacon, that's the name. It's a Sonofabitch fish.""

The Deacon shrugged it off and said, ""Alright, I'll put it on the grill. The Bishop is coming over for dinner and he loves seafood.""

When the Bishop arrived we all sat down at the table. The priest brings out the cooked fish and says, ""I caught this Sonofabitch myself.""

""And I gutted this Sonofabitch.""

""And I grilled this Sonofabitch.""

The Bishop looked around. He took his hat off, leaned in and said,

""Pretty good fish""

Now, contrary to what you may think, Big Joel was not a rapist. In fact, he was the nicest man Myto had ever met. Big Joel helped him through his day, showing him where to eat, shower, and work out. Myto woke up every morning and had a Chocolate Brownie for breakfast. The only brownies the prison sold were from a strange company called Dria. Every night, however, Myto noticed something. The power always went out at exactly 9 PM. Being an electrical engineer, Myto decided to find out why this was the case. He asked his bunkmate, Big Joel why this happened. Big Joel shook his head and sighed. “Don’t know why it’s got to be this way. It just do. Power goes out every night at 9.” Myto was perplexed. He resolved to fix this issue using all his electrical engineering prowess. He realized that by using the strange brownies made by Dria, he could make a con brownie. He hid a very powerful battery that he stole from the guards and hooked it up to the wires of his cell. To his delight, the cell lit up! Of course, this didn’t sit well with the other prisoners. Why was Myto and Big Joel’s cell lighting up even after nine PM? One of the prisoners came up to Big Joel and asked him how the hell their cell was still lighting up. Big Joel promptly replied: We made a light outta brownies.",An electrical engineer is wrongly accused of a crime.,0

Myto woke up every morning and had a Chocolate Brownie for breakfast. The only brownies the prison sold were from a strange company called Dria.
Every night, however, Myto noticed something. The power always went out at exactly 9 PM. Being an electrical engineer, Myto decided to find out why this was the case. He asked his bunkmate, Big Joel why this happened. Big Joel shook his head and sighed. “Don’t know why it’s got to be this way. It just do. Power goes out every night at 9.” Myto was perplexed. He resolved to fix this issue using all his electrical engineering prowess. He realized that by using the strange brownies made by Dria, he could make a con brownie. He hid a very powerful battery that he stole from the guards and hooked it up to the wires of his cell. To his delight, the cell lit up!
Of course, this didn’t sit well with the other prisoners. Why was Myto and Big Joel’s cell lighting up even after nine PM? One of the prisoners came up to Big Joel and asked him how the hell their cell was still lighting up. Big Joel promptly replied:

It's one of the first examples of double-pane windows in the entire country, and made of wrought iron and irreplaceable glass.

They try everything they're allowed to and maybe a bit more: resealing it, putting shutters on it. But still, the window continues to moan, and it only gets worse. They complain to the old owners that they hadn't been warned about the window, but the sellers swear up and down that the window never did that.

They think of replacing the window on the sly, but before they do, the wife brings in a medium.

The medium looks at the window. ""Hello Fred Bargle, giving a fuss, are we? What, don't like that Poles moved into your home? Think that Hitler chap had some good points about them and the Jews? Oh, and what an earful you have about what you'd have done if one of those Polish pilots had bailed over your farm, even though he was doin' more defending of the crown than your old arse?""

The medium goes on like this for a few minutes. Then, ""Whelp, only thing can be done.""

To the couple's dismay, the medium takes out a rubber mallet and with all her might hits one of the window panes. It makes an awful racket, loud enough to reverberate through the house. But the pane hasn't either fallen out or cracked.

""That should do it!"" the medium tells them.

""But what did you do?""

A farmer bought a bought a rooster and said roster was delivered later that day in a wooden crate. The farmer was excited to finally get a new rooster because he had over 50 hens but not a single rooster. As soon as he pried the crate open the rooster went straight to the hens and started to have sex with them all. The farmer was shocked. He thought “how on earth is he having sex with all these hens? I’ve never seen anything like it.” 

The next day he gets woken up by the rooster crowing right at sunrise. He looks out the window and the rooster starts to have sex with all the hens again. The farmers mouth dropped. This was unbelievable to him. But it didn’t stop there. Next the rooster started to have sex with the cows, the horses, the pigs, the sheep, the ducks, the goats, every animal the rooster could get to he was having sex with. The farmer just watched with an astonishing look on his face. 

The next morning the farmer didn’t wake up at sunrise because the rooster didn’t crow. He first thought it was strange but with how much sex the rooster was having the farmer knew he was probably tired. 

He looks out the window and he sees two vultures flying overhead. All the farmer could see was something dead laying in the field but  couldn’t tell from his house. 

He quickly got dressed to see what was going on and as he got closer he saw that the rooster was dead and the vultures were getting closer and closer to landing. Lost for words he just stood there looking trying to figure out how did the rooster die after only a couple days. He inches closer to the rooster and suddenly the rooster looks at him and says “get the hell out of here. They are just about to land.”",The Farmers New Rooster,13

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them to posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

He immediately announced that he would only be reciting poems about personal spiritual experiences. Despite this limitation, it turned out he was gifted with words and he had made it all the way to the final. His opponent was the favorite to win: a Harvard linguistics professor on the top of his career and with a mind as sharp as a knife’s edge. 

The Harvard professor was up first. He was informed of the rules: ""Two minutes to come up with a poem, and it must involve Timbuktu."" The clock started, and when the time was up the Harvard professor approached the microphone: 

""On my way through desert sand

Met a lonely caravan 

Men on camels, two by two 

Destination: Timbuktu."" 


The crowd went wild. Commentators were lyrical. This was without a doubt the best poem of the competition. The Harvard professor had done it again! But as the crowd settled down their spirits sank. As far as anyone knew, the pope had never been to Timbuktu, which was soon confirmed by the TV commentator. How could the pope have a personal spiritual experience with such a word?! 

The elderly pope was walked to the stage and informed of the same rules: ""Two minutes to come up with a poem, and it must involve Timbuktu."" The clock was started, but after only a short thought the pope stopped it. Everybody in the competition had used all the provided time, and as the pope approached the microphone a sigh went through the audience. Was he withdrawing from the competition? Would it all end in anti-climax? 

No, to everybody’s surprise the pope started to recite his poem based on personal spiritual experience: 

""Me and Tim to Brisbane went 

Met some ladies, cheap to rent. 

They were three and we were two, 

So I bucked one, and 'Tim-bucked-two.'""","At last, the long-awaited finale of the televised poem competition had arrived.",38

""No, but that's illegal, aren't you afraid of being caught?"" asked Tom.
""Everyone here does it, so we don't worry to much about that"" Paul said.

Tom nodded to the grocery store where the manager was out front, ""You're telling me he makes moonshine?""
""Of course"" replied Paul, ""Where do you think we get our supplies?""

Tom pointed to the carshop nearby with a mechanic taking a smoke outside, ""And he makes moonshine as well?""
""Of course"" replied Paul, ""Who do you think sets up and repairs the equipment for us?""

Tom pointed to the bakery where a sweet old lady was making cookies, ""What about her?""
""Of course"" replied Paul, ""Who do you think made the recipe perfect?""

Amused, Tom pointed to the priest who was watering the front lawn of the church, ""Surely the priest doesn't make moonshine?""
""Of course"" replied Paul, ""Sunday School is where the young ones learn it. They're the biggest producers in town""

At that moment the Sheriff passed them in his patrol car, and Tom looked at Paul and asked ""Of all people, the sheriff doesn't make moonshine does he?

Son : “I’m not very sure daddy. I’ll have to think about it.”

That night, awakened by his little brother’s crying and discovering he has seriously soiled his diaper, the son went to his parents’ room. Discovering his mother who’s sound asleep, he went to the maid’s room.

Peeking through the keyhole, he saw his father and the maid in bed together. He knocked, but it was not heard by the father or the maid, so he went back to sleep.

The next morning, the son reported to his father, “Daddy, I think I know what politics are now.”

Dad : “Oh, really? How would you explain it?”

A man who just died is taken to the local mortuary. He is wearing an very expensive and high quality tailored blue suit.

The mortician is a blonde female and she asks the wife of the deceased man wife how she would like the body to be dressed.

The motician says that the man does look very distinguished in the blue suit he is already wearing.

His widow, however, says that she always preferred her husband in black, and that she would like him in a black suit.

She gives the Blonde mortician a signed, blank cheque and says, ‘Spend whatever you need no matter what the cost, but please have my husband in a well tailored black suit for the viewing.’

The woman returns the next day for the viewing and to her delight, her husband dressed in a fabulous black suit. The suit fits him as if it were tailor made.

She says to the mortician, ‘You have done a magnificent job and I’m very pleased and grateful. How much did the suit cost?’

To her amazement, the blonde mortician gives her back the blank cheque.

‘There’s no charge,’ she says.

‘No, really, I must repay you for the cost of that exquisite black suit!’ she says.

‘Honestly, ma’am,’ the blonde says, ‘it cost me nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband’s size was brought in yesterday shortly after you left, he was dressed in a very attractive black suit.

You play as a car and you level up and get cool new gear and it makes you better and also looks cooler.

Anyway, we played this game for quite a while, slowly improving and getting better and better cars and things for these cars. We were doing dungeons (races), quests (errands), and dailies (stunts). Eventually, we got to around the mid-game, we had slightly above average cars, and gear. Around this time in the game, the only way to get good gear is to grind out dailies, but the loot tables weren’t balanced in the slightest so we all decided not to do dailies, since it felt like cheating.

Although we made this agreement, when the rest of us logged off, one of our friends decided to go ahead and do a pretty easy daily anyway. This daily was just to carefully drive through a spiders nest, and go across it without getting stuck or letting them destroy your car. After completing it, he saw first hand the unbalanced loot tables. He got a top-of-the-line new car, an OP engine, gold and diamond wheels, rockets on the sides, but most importantly he got a new spoiler. The spoiler’s in this game were what really determined most of your car’s stats. His new spoiler gave him godlike levels of durability, power, and made him leagues above any PvE content in the game. 

The next day, we all logged back on together and we noticed his new gear. We questioned him about it, since we had that agreement and all. His defense was “I didn’t think the loot would be that unbalanced!” Then complained that the game would be no fun anymore since he can easily beat any of the game’s content until an update comes out. We decided we wouldn’t play with him until they fixed it, but he kept whining that we weren’t being fair since he didn’t expect to become that overpowered.

We weren’t having it, though, we told him “It’s not our fault! If you didn’t want endgame spoilers, you shouldn’t have gone on the web.”",My friends found a cool racing game.,6

So in his anger he leaves behind a hatefull coomment on the lack of talking.

His mother, having died years prior, left him distraught beyond comprehension.

The young man’s father, riddled with cancer, breathed his last few words to his only son before he moved onto the dying light.

“Great rewards come to those who wait.” In his hand, the father held a pressed envelope.

Taking his father’s words to heart, the young man didn’t open the envelope. He kept it close, the red ink seal untouched and unmoved.

A month later, his child was born. The envelope still occupied his thoughts, and he, like felt his child, like the envelope suggested, would become greater over time. It was then that the young man, now a father himself, vowed to only open the envelope after he could wait as long as possible.

So, his child grew. The man and his wife raised the child normally, eventfully, and beautifully, as parenting so often is. The man relived what his father had lived: seeing a child’s first steps, first words, first day of school, first day of college—all the hallmarks of being a parent to a conventional child. 

It was a good life.

The envelope still laid in his top drawer of his nightstand, year after year, decade after decade.

Eventually, it faded into the recess of the man’s memory, until his child’s eventual visit to his deathbed. 

*Ironic*, the man thought, *to be here like my father so long ago.*

It was then he remembered the envelope his father gave him. Though he would no longer be able to open it, for he was about to die, he told his son about the envelope, and what his father had told him about the value of waiting.

The son, in turn keeping his father’s words in mind, waited. Years passed on by once again, until the son got tired of waiting.

He’d been waiting his whole life and more for what this envelope contained. He traveled to his father’s father’s old home, which was still owned by his mother, and found the envelope, still in the empty top drawer of the nightstand. The pressed red ink on the envelope had faded to brown, the paper creased in contemplation.

He broke the seal, opened the envelope, and saw what lay inside.

It was a receipt, and at the bottom was a circled 16%, inbetween 12% and 20%. The total tipped was $4.16.

The son ripped the envelope open in disbelief, and found inscribed in the inside one simple sentence.

“Waiting’s a good career son, you should try it.”",“Great rewards come to those who wait.”,5

post,bhrjgz,2qh72,jokes,false,1556313243,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bhrjgz/one_of_my_favourite_jokes/,self.jokes,," 

A man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",One of my favourite jokes,20

A rescue boat was sent out imediatly, but there was only room on board for half of the survivors. The coastguards descided to fill the boat up and then come back after for the remaining passengers, so they got everyone on board they could until there was only one space left, and they called to the nearest man, ""Quick, get in the boat!""

""No, I do not need to,"" Said the man, ""I Know God will save me.""

The coastguards were confused but had no time to waste, they quickly got the next person on board and took the first lot of survivors to safety, before soon returning for the remaining people. They filled the boat up until there was only one survivor left in the water, the same man.

""Come on,"" The coastguards said again, ""Time to get in the boat!""

""No,"" The man said once again, ""*God* Will save me.""

The coast guards became frustrated, ""What are you talking about, we can't leave you here, please get in the boat.""

But the man remained stubborn, ""No, I am a man of faith, I know God will save me.""

At this point the coatguards realised a storm was approaching and they had to get those already in the rescue boat back to shore. A few minutes later however, they returned for a third time.

""Now, this is your last chance,"" They said to the man, ""We won't be able to come back again, you must get in the boat now.""

Once again the man repeated, ""No, God will save.""

""Listen,"" The coastguards said sternly, ""A storm is approaching, there's no way you'll survuive, and we can't stay here forever. You must get in the boat now.""

By this point the man had grown angry, ""How many times do I have to tell you? I Don't need your boat. I Am a faithful, God fearing man, and I *know* God will save me!""

At this point the coastguards could see the storm was starting to form, so with no other choice, they turned the rescue boat  around and retreated to shore in defeat and dismay.

The storm came, and the man drowned.

He sits down at the bar and starts reading the morning paper. The bartender walks over and asks him what he wants.

“Want coffee!” The chief says, proudly and firmly.

The bartender brings him a steaming mug of warm coffee. The Native American Chief downs it in three big gulps, then he stands, points his rifle at the big bull carcass, and fires. Blood and guts go everywhere. He slaps his money down on the bar and leaves.

The next morning, the bartender smiles at the shining surface of the walls and bar inside the pub he and his other coworkers have painstakingly cleaned over the previous day. The same Native American man walks in with a new bull carcass and his shotgun. Again he orders coffee, he shoots the bull carcass, and plasters blood, gore, and assorted bull parts all over the bar’s interior. He then rises, pays, and abruptly leaves.

This continues for two more days. Each time the same chief enters, drinks coffee, blasts bull carnage everywhere with his gun, and leaves the pub.

On the fifth day, the pub is in shambles. Red stains and blotches are all over the walls, having permanently stained the once immaculate interior of the pub. Customers have started to avoid the place. The bartender laments this to himself and the fact of how it is becoming such a burden to himself and the rest of the staff to have to rigorously and thoroughly clean the bar each day from the filth the chief has inflicted upon it daily. 

The Native American Chief once again comes in and sits down. He once again orders coffee. When he has drunk, he once again picks up his gun and aims it at his newly killed bull carcass. 

This time, the bartender runs in and, waving his arms, stops him.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second, buddy,” the bartender implores, “what’s this behavior all about? You’ve been at this for 5 days now, coming in here and making a mess like that? How do you explain yourself???”

The chief smiles and lays down the carcass and gun and happily explains.

“I run for Congress next term. Meanwhile, I practice to become politician. I come in, drink coffee, shoot bull, leave big mess for someone else to clean up, then leave!”",A Native American Chief Walks into a Pub One morning.,1

The priest stopped, ""Son, why such salty language?""

Wanting to save face I quickly replied, ""No, Father, that's the name of that fish. It's a Sonofabitch fish.""

The priest was relieved and we began walking back to the rectory and a nun met us at the door.
The priest greeted her and said, ""Check out the Sonofabitch I just caught.""

The nun, shocked, exclaimed, ""Father, never in my life-""

The priest interrupted her and said, ""No, Sister, that's the name. It's a Sonofabitch fish.

The nun was relieved and took the fish to be gutted. After gutting the fish, she brought it out back where the Deacon was heating up the grill. The nun said, ""Deacon, here, I gutted this Sonofabitch for you.""

The Deacon, shaking his head, said, ""Sister, that language is unbecoming.""

The nun replied, ""No Deacon, that's the name. It's a Sonofabitch fish.""

The Deacon shrugged it off and said, ""Alright, I'll put it on the grill. The Bishop is coming over for dinner and he loves seafood.""

When the Bishop arrived we all sat down at the table. The priest brings out the cooked fish and says, ""I caught this Sonofabitch myself.""

""And I gutted this Sonofabitch.""

""And I grilled this Sonofabitch.""

A young boy goes off to college.

Half way through the semester, having foolishly squandered all his money .... he calls home.

""Dad"" he says, ""You won't believe what modern education is developing!

They actually have a program here in our institution that will teach our dog, Jack, how to talk!""

""That's amazing,""his father says. ""How do I get Jack in that program?""

""Just send him down here with $10,000"" the young boy says "" and I'll get him in the course.""

So his father sends the dog and$10,000. About two-thirds of the way through the semester, the money again runs out.The boy calls home.

""So how's Jack doing son?"" his father asks.

""Awesome, dad, he's talking up a storm,"" he says, ""but you just won't believe this, they've had such good results they have started to teach the animals how to read!""

""Read ??""says his father, ""No kidding! How do we get Jack in that program?""

""Just send $20,000, I'll get him in the class.""
The money promptly arrives. But our hero has a problem.

At the end of the year, his father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. So he shoots the dog. When he arrives home at the end of the year, his father is all excited.

""Where's Jack? I just can't wait to see him read something and talk!""

""Dad"" the boy says, ""I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Jack was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading The Economic Times, like he usually does. Then Jack turned to me and asked, so, is your father still having an affair with that pretty lady Rachel who lives down the street ?""

The father went white and exclaimed, ""I hope you shot that son of a bitch before he talks to your Mother!""

Just listen to the parishioner’s confession, give them a penance you feel is suitable and send them on their way.""
He enters the confessional and the first person speaks. “Forgive me father for I have sinned. Yesterday I saw my neighbour arrive home in his new car. I felt a pang of jealousy, and for a short time wished him harm.” The man replies “Say three Hail Marys, and reflect on your thoughts. Go in peace.”
Shortly after, the next person enters and says “Forgive me father for I have sinned. This morning I found a wallet in the gutter. I kept the cash that was in it, and threw the wallet in the trash.” The man replies “Say ten Hail Marys, and try your best to find that wallet and return it to the owner. Go in peace.”
Minutes later a third person enters. A young female voice says “Forgive me father for I have sinned. Last night I went to visit my best friend. She wasn’t home, but her husband was. He invited me in to wait. While waiting he offered me a drink of wine. We drank a couple of glasses each, the talk turned a little risqué, one thing lead to another. I found myself performing fellatio on my best friend’s husband in their living room. I feel so ashamed.”
The young man doesn’t know what to do, so he quietly leaves the confessional and finds the pastor. He asks “Father, help me please. What do you give for a blowjob?” The pastor replies “Well it depends on the choirboy, but usually a pat on the head and a can of Coke.”",A young man has recently been appointed to a small church in a quiet little town while training to become a priest.,1

post,bhh455,2qh72,jokes,false,1556245513,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bhh455/official_facts_about_uranus/,self.jokes,,"

The following questions were answered by astronomer Dr. Cathy Imhoff of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

-The Sun doesn't shine on Uranus.

How far is Uranus from the sun?
Uranus is 19 times farther from the sun than Earth is. That is almost 2,000,000,000 (two billion) miles!

-Uranus is very uncomfortable.

Why is Uranus so cold and why is it blue?
Uranus is so cold because it is so far from the sun. It is 19 times farther from the sun than Earth is. It's like standing by a fire on a cold day — only the people who are close to the fire stay warm!

-Uranus produces gas.

Uranus looks blue because of its clouds. The methane in the clouds absorbs red light so only blue light is reflected back to us.

-Uranus got knocked sideways.

Why is Uranus turned on its side?
That's a very good question! It isn't easy to turn a planet onto its side. Our best guess is that early on, when the sun and planets were forming, there was a big collision between Uranus and another body that caused the planet to rotate on its side.

-Uranus is tipsy. 

What is the weather like on Uranus?
First of all, it is COLD. The surface temperature is about –300° Fahrenheit degrees! There are strong winds, and sometimes cirrus clouds made up of methane ice crystals are seen in the atmosphere. Since Uranus is tipped on its side, it has strange seasons. For part of its ""year,"" the north pole is pointed at the sun, and for another part, the south pole is pointed at the sun. The planet rotates pretty fast — once every 17 hours — faster than Earth even though it is much smaller.

Then out comes a printed diagnosis that tells you everything that’s going wrong &amp; what to do about it!

The next day he gets up earlier than usual, excited to test that machines abilities to the max— 
&amp; so he begins. Thinking... how to execute his plan exactly.  First he noticed his wife forgot to flush just before she stepped into the shower. So he scoops out a wee bit of her pee &amp; flushes the toilet! 
As odds might have it, later that morning his daughter forgot to flush as well— so he scoops out a bit of her pee too. Now with his concoction of pee in hand, he decides to do one of his favorite activities &amp; jerk off in it, you know... just for good measure! Then puts a cap on it &amp; heads straight downtown to the machine, quickly places his sample into it &amp; WAITS. He was waiting much longer this time when he thought, I’ve got this machine trapped now, hahaha. Seconds later the machine starts printing something. The man so obsessed with testing the machine, grabs the print out. IT READ: You’re wife’s pregnant, she’s got twins, they’re not yours... so get a lawyer.

He thinks I’ve got an idea on how to really test that how precise that damn machine is  &amp; goes to sleep.

The next day he gets up earlier than usual, excited to test that machines abilities to the max— 
&amp; so he begins. Thinking... how to execute his plan exactly.  First he noticed his wife forgot to flush just before she stepped into the shower. So he scoops out a wee bit of her pee &amp; flushes the toilet! 
As odds might have it, later that morning his daughter forgot to flush as well— so he scoops out a bit of her pee too. Now with his concoction of pee in hand, he decides to do one of his favorite activities &amp; jerk off in it, you know... just for good measure!

He was waiting much longer this time when he thought, I’ve got this machine trapped now, hahaha. Seconds later the machine starts printing something. The man so obsessed with testing the machines capabilities, grabs the print out. IT READ: You’re wife’s pregnant, she’s got twins, they’re not yours... so get a lawyer.

So he opened it and it read: 

""Dear God, I am an 83-year-old widow living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had a hundred quid in it which was all the money I had until my next pension payment. This Sunday is Easter, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?""

  
The postal worker was touched and went around showing the letter to all the others. Each of them dug into his wallet and came up with a few quid. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96 which they put into an envelope and sent over to her.

  
The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of the nice thing they had done.  
Easter came and went, and a few days later came another letter from the old lady to God.  
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. It read: ""Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?""

  
""Because of your generosity, I was able to fix a lovely dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day, and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. By the way, there was £4 missing. It was no doubt those thieving bastards at the post office.""",No good deed goes unpunished...,4

A little old grey-haired lady went into the bank one day carrying a bag of money. She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, ""It's a lot of money!""

After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president's office (after all, the customer is always right).

The bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit. She replied, ""$165,000!"" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk.

The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, ""Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?""

The old lady replied, ""I make bets.""

The president then asked, ""Bets? What kind of bets?""

The old woman said, ""Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.""

""Ha!"" laughed the president, ""That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!""

The old lady challenged, ""So, would you like to take my bet?""

""Sure,"" said the president, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!""

The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. as a witness?""

""Sure!"" replied the confident president.

President gets nervous

That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.

The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!""

The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president did.

The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.

""Well, okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""

Just then he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.

The president asked the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

She replied, ""Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 a.m. today, I'd have the bank president's balls in my hand.""",The little old lady who makes bets with bank presidents (NSFW),14

“Ah,” says the old man. “I use the ant eggs to make a dish called maengman chom. The Cambodians who visit here especially love it; they spend so many riel on it that I had that display made to show off the ants. It’s a specialty of mine; would you like to try some?”

“Ant eggs are a little exotic for my taste,” says the tourist. “How about just some regular fried eggs?”

“Sorry,” says the old man. “The post truck brings me eggs from the village down the road, but the road is so bumpy that the yolks get pretty shaken up by the time they get here. I can use them for cooking my rice dishes, but fried eggs wouldn’t turn out well.”

Disappointed, the tourist ponders the menu.

“Well since you have ants here for ant eggs, why don’t you get some chickens here too so you will always have fresh chicken eggs and you don’t have to worry about getting subpar ones in the mail?”

“Well,” explains the old man. “The ants in the display can’t possibly make all the eggs I need. I have many more ants on my farm out back. If I had chickens there too, they would eat all the ants and I wouldn’t be able to make my maengman chom anymore.”

“It just seems like you could appeal to more than Cambodians if you had good chicken eggs,” responds the tourist. “Who knows? Maybe you could get some more American dollars out here.”

“No offense, but the Cambodian money is what keeps this place going, and chicken eggs aren’t why they come,” says the old man. “I may get a few complaints about the worn out yolks in the post, but everyone around here can tell you that the riel yolks are in the chom ants.”","An American tourist is traveling in Thailand and stops over in a small border village for a meal.
