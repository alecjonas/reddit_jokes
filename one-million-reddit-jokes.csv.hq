The blonde replies ""I'm a blonde, I'm smart and have a good job.

So the flight attendant, now hot under the collar at the blonde's response, goes to another flight attendant and tells him what happened. 

so he goes up to her and asks her to move to the back of the plane.

She then responds ""I'm a blonde, I'm smart and have a good job. 

I'm not moving until the plane arrives in Jamaica"".

So the two flight attendants are steaming mad and they go to the co-pilot and tells him what is going on. 

He comes back to where the blonde is sitting and leans over and whispers something in her ear.

The two flight attendants were astonished when the blonde abruptly got up from her seat and moved to the back of the plane.
 
They looked at each other and then the co-pilot and asked him what he told her.

The co-pilot, feeling good about himself told them ""oh, this happened a while back with someone else. 

I just simply told the woman that the front half of the plane wasn't going to Jamaica"".",There's this blonde.,100

And no, the boy was not sad that his family was weird.

The family noticed the boys sadness and decided to try and cheer him up. The dad, Share, thought what cheers him up and decided to try and give the boy his allowance for the month a bit early. This had no affect on the boy and he continued to be sad. 

The mom, Borrow, thought maybe he'd like his favorite meal, so she cooked him up the biggest bacon cheeseburger anyone had ever seen. The boy, not feeling hungry from his sadness, didn't feel like eating and so they continued to try and cheer him up.

The uncle, Taking, thought that maybe he just needed to get outside and so he offered to take the boy out to play catch or whatever it is that kids do these days. Hey, he was just trying to help. The boy turned down the offer, still sad. 

Finally the aunt, Giving, sat the boy down and asked him what was wrong. The boy broke down crying saying a girl he was seeing had just broken his heart. The poor guy.  The aunt let him cry it out and soon he started to feel better. He played catch with his uncle, he took his dad's money and he ate that massive cheeseburger. He started to feel human again. 

His aunt came up to him as he finished his burger and asked him how he was doing. 

He looked up at her smiling and said those three little words.

She makes it through security and gets onto the plane. The plane starts to take off and she feels relieved.  A bit of time goes by and the pilot gets on the intercom saying ""alright passengers feel free to walk across the cabin at this time, thank you"". The pilot then proceeds to walk down the isle smoking a cigar, and go up to some of the passengers asking ""are you having a good flight?, how is your flight?, are you guys doing alright?"" while puffing on his cigar. He then goes up the lady and asks her ""are you enjoying your flight ma'am?"" The lady replies ""yes very much so..tweettweettweet"". ""I'm sorry what was that?"" Replies the pilot. ""What was whatweettweettweet"". The pilot pulls down his shades and says ""ma'am, is there a bird under your jacket"". ""No...tweettweet"". ""Ma'am I'm going to need you to open up your jacket"". The lady opens up her jacket and the pilot sees the bird and snatches it. ""Look lady, it clearly states that there are NO BIRDS ALLOWED ON THIS PLANE"" he opens up the window and throws the bird out of it.

Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said, ""I don't know what you're laughing about, Your wife fell three times this week.""",There's this old priest who got sick of all the people in his parish who kept confessing to adultery.,484

Unfortunately, he fell asleep; and when he woke up, he was badly burned especially at the groin region. Also he only had an hour before the date, so he was not able to do first aid. 


The guy drove off towards the blonde's house where, fast forward, they were having sex; and after he came, the sunburn acted up. 


The pain was too much at this point, so he excused himself and said that he was going to get a drink.


He went to the kitchen and opened the fridge where there was a bottle of wine, and two cartons of juice and milk.


He frantically took the wine and doused his crotch. He was relieved but only for a minute, so he grabbed the juice and poured it onto his piece.


At this moment, the blonde was wondering what's taking him so long. So she went to the kitchen where she saw him take out the milk and spill it in his pants. 


The blonde chuckled and remarked: ""So that's how they refill it!""

Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs.  Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies,  and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours.

Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Born and bread in Minnesota , Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half- baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still was a crusty old man but was considered a positive roll model for millions.

Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.",The Pillsbury Doughboy died today...,136

As the train journey is extremely long and there is nothing else to do, the well educated man decides to entertain himself by playing a game with the alcoholic. 

The well educated man says “Let’s play a game! We’ll ask each other questions, when I ask you a question and you don’t know the answer, you have to give me a dollar. But when you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’ll give you one hundred dollars!” The simple minded man agrees to play. 

“What’s the capital of Kuwait?”

“I don’t know... here’s a dollar” 


“What is the distance between the Earth and the Sun?”

“I don’t know... here’s a dollar” 


“How many species of Dolphins are there?” 

“I don’t know... here’s a dollar” 

The simple minded man then gets to ask his question. 

“Horns on its head and horns on its ass, what is it?” 

The well educated man gets taken aback as he doesn’t know the answer. He gets frustrated and starts thinking, he spends the next several hours contemplating all the possibilities but he still can’t come up with anything. 

“This is a stupid game anyway! Here’s the hundred dollars, I don’t care anymore! Just hurry up and tell me what the hell has horns on its head and horns on its ass”

Anyway I get there and I’m waiting in this cold room when a dude in a doctor coat and a salmon dress shirt walks in. He was a short, middle aged balding, fairly jovial and bespectacled man with rosy cheeks and a Michael Crichton beard. Completely unassuming, and much happier than anyone who was going to stick a digit in my asshole had any right to be.

We go through the usual. Allergies, meds, medical conditions, blood pressure, my diet.

and the whole time this dude is just a smilin’. Eventually I ask him if he got lucky or
something before coming in here. He laughs and says “No, most men are uncomfortable with the prospect of a rectal examination, I try to make them as comfortable as I can.”

I tell him it’d take more than a colgate smile to make me comfortable with getting in my butt. He laughs again and says “Well sometimes I crack jokes, I could tell you a story if you wanted.”

I figure what the hell and tell him to hit me with his best one. 

He says every year he and a few physician colleagues go to conferences to listen to lectures on various topics. “This is isn’t why we really go.” he says, he goes on to laugh and say “we have an ongoing bet for a thousand dollars each year and all of us chip in.”

He starts doing a quick head to toe physical while I’m in my gown freezing my balls off as he tells this story.

“So the point of the bet is to find the presenter for each specialty that you are. So for example my Pediatrician friend has to find the Pediatric lecturer before I find the Proctologist lecturer and we all get one guess.”

“If none of us get it then that money is pooled for next years bet, the highest we’ve gotten is 4000 dollars. BUT! I’ve won the last three times in a row.”

At this point he has me bent over and is quickly washing his hands and grabbing whatever he needs to do the deed. I’m gettig nervous so I say, “I’ll bite, how have you won the last three times?”

Suddenly I feel his cold finger slide right up my asshole. Bit of a shock to say the least. He laughs and says, “Well usually the proctologist lecturer is the one who has been practicing the longest, and there is a dead givaway for that.”

He reaches his free hand around to my peripheral vision and I notice he is holding a pair of latex gloves in his bare hand. I feel his breath on my neck as he whispers in my ear.

“You look for the one with the wrinkliest finger.”",My friends say I’m funny so I figured I’d write a joke.,4

All was well, until a pack of wild tubes grazing by the road started to run at Franklin with a wild look in their eyes. 

“AWHOOOOOOOOOHAH!” Yelled Juan. And suddenly all the tubes dropped to the ground, dead as a door nail.

“Oh my gosh! What in the world was that?” Asked Franklin.

“Some tubes can get a little fiesta sometimes. Nothing to worry about.” said Juan.

The rest of the tour went by without a hitch. Franklin said goodbye and began to walk back to the hotel where he was staying. 

All of a sudden, Franklin saw three groups of tubes charging at him, and this time he could see they meant business. Franklin froze in his tracks. He tried to remember what Juan had said only a few hours ago. With all the courage he could muster, Franklin let loose.

post,9l5h11,2qh72,jokes,false,1538601557,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9l5h11/light_matters/,self.jokes,,"Once, there was a freshman who worked in the student lounge of his college's physics building during lunch. He planned to major in physics and liked to be near the offices of the physics professors while he worked. Though most of the professors ate lunch at the campus cafeteria, there were a still several who had lunch in their offices. One of the professors who had lunch in her office used the sink in the student lounge to wash her hands before eating.

In the interest of saving money and energy, the college had mounted a motion sensor in the corner of the lounge. If it didn't detect any movement over a certain peroid of time, it would turn off the lights. If it did pick up movement, it would turn them back on. Most times, when the lounge was used, there were many professors and students ambling about, so the motion detector had little effect on what transpired.

But when the student came in to work, he would turn on the light, sit down at the computer, and sure enough, after a couple minutes, the motion detector would switch off the lights. And when the professor came in to wash her hands, the detector would switch them back on--only to switch them off shortly after she went back to her office. The student was annoyed that the light didn't just stay on and so, since he didn't mind working in the dark, one day didn't bother to turn on the lights when he walked in.

By now, the professor had come to expect to the lights to click on when she entered the lounge. So when they didn't, she turned to the student and, understanding the importance of having a well-lit workspace, said:

""You know, light matters.""

This reminded the student of a debate he overheard between some of the other professors, and, without missing a beat, replied:

""Well, I don't know about that, professor. I've heard some people around here say, 'light waves.' """,Light Matters,2
