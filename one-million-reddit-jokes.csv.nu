He was, by far, one of the best train conductors his company had. He had been working there for over 3 decades now.  

One day, while everyone was making their daily commute, the Train conductor made a grave error, and this resulted in 5 deaths. The company called him up, and explained to him ""While you did cause many deaths, you are the best train conductor we have, so we'll ignore your old age and homicide for now"". So the Train conductor was free to do his job once more. 

Only a week later, this same train conductor made another fatal error, resulting, in this case, 10 deaths. The company called him up once more and stated ""Listen. This is really pushing it now. By policy we have to fire you. But, we cant hire anyone right now, and you have had an almost scarless record, so we'll give you one last chance. This is your last one though, so if you make any more mistakes, its court for you"". The train conductor felt giddy and walked out relieved. 

Only to make the same mistake the next week. He was taken to court, and tried for the murder of 50 innocent individuals. He was sentenced to death by the electric chair. His company would not make a statement. 

Sitting in the chair, the train conductor seemed relatively calm, even though he was about to die. The official pulling the lever asked ""Any last words?"" The conductor said ""Not yet. In a bit"". Confused, but having to follow protocol, the official pulled the switch. 

**BANG!**

The official opened his eyes, and there was the train conductor, sitting there, perfectly fine. As the train conductor started mumbling, he leaned in to hear what he had to say.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

So I rush down to the hospital and I see her one last time before her operation, the doctor tells me it's unlikely she'll live. I hear the news the next day. She died from internal bleeding. I was so distraught, then came the funeral day. Held at 10 AM. She was in her casket. I went up to the podium to say some words. But right then I popped a boner. I don't know why. Was I still attracted to her even though she was dead? That's what everyone seemed to think. The rumour spread quickly. Soon I was outcast as a monster, and it was all because of my mourning wood.",My name is Mark,9

Down the shore there was a hunter watching the bear watch the trout watch the fly thinking, ""If that fly would drop down the trout would jump, the bear would lunge and I'd have a perfect shot and I'd have dinner.""

‘Good grief, did you see that?’ she asks her husband. He hadn’t, so she asks him to look in the pot. He reaches for it and again the lid rises, and he sees two little eyes looking around before it slams down..

Rather perturbed, he calls the waiter over, explains what is happening, and  demands an explanation.

There was no success, but members of the expedition haven't lost faith until the end. When they finally found the place of the disaster, they saw a horrific picture. Burnt-out trees, parts of the plane crushed and scattered around, all the luggage... No trace of the victims of the accident though.

Then, at the top of the conflagration, they noticed a bearded, half naked man, leaning against a tree. He was busy gnawing a big bone. When he finished sucking all the marrow, he threw it on the huge stack of similar, clean bones under his feet. Noticing the members of the expedition he shouted with relief ""My god, I am saved! Miracle you guys reached here.""

The expedition was more interested about the area of the crash. Over time, the truth about the terrible things that had to happen was coming to them. It looked like rescued man had to eat bodies of every companion. Seeing silent accusation in the eyes of the rescuers, he yelled hysterically: ""You can't judge me because of that! Is it bad that I wanted to survive?""

Dad says, ""Well son, let me try to explain it this way:
I am the head of the family, so call me The President.

Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her The Government.

We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you The People.

The Nanny, we will consider her The Working Class.

And your Baby Brother, we will call him The Future.

Now think about that and see if it makes sense.

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother
crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper; So the little boy goes to his parent's room and finds his mother sound asleep.
Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.
Finding the door locked, he peeps in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny.  He gives up and goes back to bed.

The next morning, the little boy say's to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now,""
 
The father says, ""Great son!  Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.""

The little boy replies, ""The president is screwing The Working Class while The Government is sound asleep.  The People are being ignored and The Future is in deep shit.",Explaining politics to a kid,195

He was stranded on the island as a little boy, he knows how to speak but he knows nothing about the wonders of the modern world. Him and his family were thought to have perished in a freak yacht accident, nobody ever found the yacht. He somehow managed to survive all these years by eating coconuts and berry's and probably catching some fish or whatever.

Anyway... a few moments after his rescue, the man is already famous. The story of his unusual situation spreads quickly around the country, he gets named ""the Robinson Crusoe boy"" by the newspapers (These newspapers and their lack of imagination when naming things, jeez.) 

The guys hometown (from before he got stranded) has decided to throw him an awesome welcoming ceremony. The mayor is going to have a speech, and there will be a large cake and probably some ribbon to cut and whatnot. The authorities are going to give the guy a decent house to live in. Some toilet cleaning company is going to give him a job. Everybody wants to do something nice for the Robinson Crusoe boy.

Anyway.. he mayor has ordered his own personal driver to go pick the guy up at the docks and bring him to the party. The driver is known to be quite the prankster and decides that since Robinson Crusoe boy knows nothing of modern civilization, there must be some cool pranks that can be pulled.

The driver arrives at the docks, driving the limo (mayors ride in limo's right?) and picks the guy up. As they are driving, Robinson Crusoe boy is looking out the windows, looking at the buildings and cars and whatnot. His eyes are wide with amazement. ""WOW, this is all so amazing. I cant believe my eyes."" The driver smiles ""Err, yea I guess.. whatever"".

Suddenly the driver has a wonderful idea on how to prank the Robinson Crusoe boy. The next time he sees a pedestrian on the road he starts revving the car, swerving towards the pedestrian but just at the last minute swerves away, barely missing the walking person. ""Goddamit, the fucker got away!"". Robinson Crusoe boy seems surprised but doesn't say anything.

The driver decides to pull the prank again and when he sees another pedestrian he starts revving the car, swerving to another near miss. ""Goddamit! missed again."" He looks back at Robinson Crusoe boy and say's with a grin ""This just aint my day man"". Robinson Crusoe boy's jaw is wide open, as are his eyes. He has had a surprised look since they started moving but now his eyes really seem to be coming out of his head. The driver is laughing so hard on the inside, everyone is going to find this so funny when he tells them at the party.

He decides to have one more go. He starts swerving and revving. Heads straight toward an old lady who is walking across the street with her dog (its a pomeranian, in case you were wondering). At the last minute the driver swerves away but as he passes the old lady he hears a loud bang. The driver looks on terrified as he watches the old lady and her dog flying through the air (they both died later, im sorry).

With panic on his face and tears forming in his eyes the driver looks back at Robinson Crusoe boy who is all smiles. He half yells in an exited voice ""Did you see that man! I nailed her with the door!"" He nudges the driver with his elbow smiling ""looks like this might just be your day after all, huh!?""",A man gets rescued after spending his whole life on a desert island.,7

Of course she wanted to go; dressing up, music, dancing, and showing off her boyfriend.

So he went to wait in line to buy tickets.
He needed some formal wear, so he went out shopping, found the right suit, and waited in line to pay.

He also wanted to do something spectacular, so he goes to a rent a limo for their big night. Again, waiting in line until he can make his request, and pay.

The day of prom comes and he wants to be traditional. He goes to the flower shop to pick up a corsage for his lady. It was prom season, and flowers were in high demand, so the line was long.

He picks up his girlfriend, they take pictures and go to prom. Of course, with lots of people in an enclosed area with lots of dancing, it gets warm.

He tells her he's going to get drinks, and asked if she wanted a drink as well. Of course she agrees.
He goes and gets the drinks and comes back in just a moment.

There was no punchline.",A young lad decided to ask his girlfriend to prom.,31

Even more embarrassed the girls father answers ""Well, those are the ducks eggs"". ""Eggs?.. weird."" The girl accepts her dads answer and he is proud of himself for the clever little lie he thought up.

The girl goes on to play on the beach while her dad has a few beers while he lies on a beach-towel, sunbathing . After a few beers the girls father is getting a little drunk and falls asleep (hes not the best dad in the world, this is just the kind of thing he does).

Anyway, the guy is lying there sleeping when he suddenly wakes up to a sharp and sudden pain. He opens his eyes and see's his daughter is standing over him, stomping on his junk. ""Aaaarghh, why are you doing this to me?!"" he exclaims with a sob.

The little girl has an angry expression in her face but takes a short pause from her stomping to catch her breath. ""Your not gonna believe this dad, I was just petting the duck, like real gentle and everything. It seemed to like it but then out of nowhere it.."" The girl clenches her fist and looks her father dead serious in the eye. ""It fucking spit on me!""",A weekend dad brought his 3 year old daughter to a nude beach.,2

One day, the father of the family walks out to the barn to see his prized milkcow, Macow, dead on the ground. He knows this means the end of their only source of income, and he is so distraught that he hangs himself in the barn. 

Later in the day, the mother of the family goes out to the barn to see their prized milkcow, Macow, dead on the floor, and her husband hanging from the rafters. She is so distraught that she heads down the river and throws herself in, killing herself. 

Later in the day, the eldest son of the family goes out to the barn and sees their prized milkcow, Macow, dead on the floor, and the father hung from the rafters. He then heads down to the river and sees his mother washed up on shore, dead. He then sees a leprechaun, a female leprechaun. 

The leprechaun approaches and asks ""Having a bad day?"" 

""Suppose so"", the eldest son responds. 

The leprechaun then tells him, ""if you can have sex with me 5 times in a row without stopping, I'll bring your parents, and your prized milkcow, Macow, back to life.""

""Why not?"" says the eldest son, but only lasts twice before having to stop so the Leprechaun kills him.

However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a bit. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer.

Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?",My roommate Joseph,33

She grabbed carrots, potatoes, celery, radishes and a out to the barn for a rabbit. She gathered all the ingredients and was getting ready to start putting them into the pot when she realized she didn't have any onions.

""Well, I certainly cant make a delicious stew without any onions!"" she exclaimed.

So, put the rabbit back in the barn and left everything else on the counter. She donned her bonnet and boots and decided to head down to the market to buy some onions.

She went straight to Tommy's produce stand. He always had the freshest vegetables.

""Well, top of the morning to you Mrs. O'Malley! How does this wonderful day find you?"" Tommy greeted her.

""Ahh, well Tommy, I was going to make a stew for John, but I don't have any onions."" Mrs. O'Malley lamented.

""Well, I'm sorry to say Mrs. O'Malley, but we are fresh out and I don't expect any onions until Thursday."" Tommy replied.

""Oh, well I suppose Ill come back then, Tommy. Have a good day."" Mrs. O'Malley said.

Well, Tuesday comes and Mrs. O'Malley sees all of her ingredients for the delicious stew are still on the counter.

""Well, I certainly cant make a delicious stew without onions! Ill head down to Tommy's, he always has the freshest vegetables!"" Mrs. O'Malley claimed excitedly.

So, she donned her bonnet and boots and headed straight away for Tommy's.

""Wellll, its good to see you again, Mrs. O'Malley, and top of the morning to ya. What can I do for this morning!"" Tommy smiled.

""Well Tommy, I was going to make a stew for John, but I don't have any onions. I came here straight away because you have the freshest onions!"" Mrs. O'Malley said matter of factly.

Tommy chuckled, ""Well, Mrs. O'Malley, you must have forgotten. Today is Tuesday and I wont have any onions until Thursday!""

""Oh, of course. I will come back then."" Mrs. O'Malley stated.

Wednesday rolls around and Mrs. O'Malley comes downstairs to find all the ingredients for a delicious stew on the table, but alas, there are no onions!

""Well, I cant very well make a delicious stew without any onions!"" Mrs. O'Malley exclaimed. ""Ill head straight away to Tommy's. He always has the freshest vegetables.""

So, she donned her bonnet and boots and headed for Tommy's.

Tommy see's Mrs. O'Malley headed for his stand and, lets just say Tommy wasn't have a top of the morning.

""Hello, Mrs. O'Malley. What do you want."" Tommy grumbled.

""Well, Tommy, I was going to make a stew---"" Mrs. O'Malley started.

""Ya, you were going to make a stew for John and you don't have any onions."" Tommy said, cutting her off.

""Well, that's right Tommy, how did you know?"" Mrs. O'Malley said surprisingly.

""Mrs. O'Malley, let me ask you a couple of questions. If you take the A-T-O out of potato, what do you get?""

""Well Tommy, I suppose you would get POT."" Mrs. O'Malley said.

""Right, okay, if you take the A-T-O of tomato, what do you get?"" Tommy asked.

""Well, you would certainly get TOM!"" Mrs. O'Malley said with a smile.

""Very good, Mrs. O'Malley, now, if you take the F-U-C-K out of onions, what do you get?"" Tommy asked, his patience running thin.

""Well Tommy, I... well, there is no FUCK in onions"" Mrs. O'Malley said, very confused.

""THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU MRS. O'MALLEY!"" Tommy screamed.

All of a sudden the young child lost his balance and fell inside the cage.  The man noticed the lion look over and without thinking jumped the fence, grabbed the young boy, handed him back over the fence to his parents, and then as the lion was running up to him, he instinctively punched the lion in the nose, which caused the lion to back off in surprise long enough for the man to get back out of the enclosure.  The child's parents were thanking the man profusely when a woman came running up holding a pad of paper and pen, and said, ""I'm a reporter and I just saw what you did, I'd love to have your permission to run this story in tomorrow's paper, how does this headline sound to you: BRAVE DEMOCRAT HEROICALLY SAVES YOUNG CHILD FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL!""  The man, says ""Of course you can run the story, but I don't think it was anything heroic, just what one person would do for another, and I do have one small correction: I'm actually a republican.""  The reporter thanks him for his time and after getting a few more details goes on her way.

The next day the man gets a copy of the paper to see the story about him, and on page three sees the headline: ""WHITE CIS-HET MALE ASSAULTS AFRICAN IMMIGRANT AND STEALS HIS LUNCH""",One day at the zoo,39

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”

The bartender was put off by the man's looks, but pointed him to the piano in the corner.

As the old man began to play, the room was filled with the most beautiful, melodious music anyone in the bar had ever heard. During the song, all talk stopped and when the music ended, the patrons leaped to their feet; yelling and applauding wildly.

""Hey, Old Timer,"" said the barkeep. ""You're really good. What was that beautiful song?""

""I call it 'Drop them panties Momma, I'm gonna do ya all night long'.""

Momentarily stunned, the bartender held his temper and said, ""Interesting title. Do you have another?"" The old man nodded and broke into a foot stomping honky-tonk piece that brought the bar patrons to their feet. The crowd clapped along until it was finished, then broke into a thunderous round of applause and filled his tip mug to overflowing.

""You are amazing,"" exclaimed the barkeep. ""Just amazing! What do you call that one?""

""Oh, that's a little ditty I call 'I wanna spank yer bare butt, baby, till you scream and holler'."" The bartender held his tongue -- the guy was certainly good, despite the outrageous song titles.

Then, the piano man rose, excused himself, and shuffled off to use the restroom.

While he was gone, the patrons begged the bartender to give the eccentric old musician the job. So, when the old man returned, the barkeep said, ""Mister, you are the greatest piano player I've ever heard. If you want the job, it's yours.""

Suddenly, the barkeep noticed that the man had not finished his trip to the restroom. Not wanting to embarrass the old fellow, he leaned toward him and whispered, ""Sir, do you know your pecker's hanging out for all the world to see?""

""Know it?"" the geezer grinned. ""Hell, I wrote it!""

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, that it only took a little while. The American then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish. The Mexican said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs.

The American then asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""

The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.""

The American scoffed. ""I am a Wharton MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.""

The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But señor, how long will this all take?""

To which the American replied, ""Fifteen or twenty years.""

""But what then, señor?""

The American laughed and said, ""That's the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.""

""Millions, señor? Then what?""

The American said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.""",Conversation between a fisherman and an MBA graduate,735

''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.

One's name was Razzle, and the other's name was Dazzle. The farmer lived with these horses grazing in the field, and his faithful dog by his side. He lived the dream.  
  
One day, the farmer decides that the horses should have a race. He puts Razzle and Dazzle at the starting line, and he raises the starting gun: *BLAM!* And it was,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle, by a nose!  
  
And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the county fair. And he said, ""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the county fair!"" And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  
  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the county fair raised his starting gun: *BLAM!* And it was,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle, by a nose!  
  
And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the state fair. And he said, ""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the state fair!"" And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  
  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the state fair raised his starting gun: *BLAM!* And it was,  
Razzle,

And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the national fair. And he said, ""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the national fair!"" And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  
  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the national fair raised his starting gun: *BLAM!* And it was,

And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the World's Fair. And he said, ""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the national fair!""  
And the farmer said, ""Wait, there's a horse race at the World's Fair? Isn't that an invention exhibition?""  
The head of the World's Fair said, ""Yeah, they just added a whole new part of the fair just for horse racing. Just roll with it.""  
And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  
  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the World's Fair raised his starting gun: *BLAM!* And it was,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle, by a nose!  
  
And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the solar system fair! And the alien said, ""Beep bop boop gleeeeeep!"" which roughly translates to ""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the solar system fair!""  
And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  
  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the solar system fair raised his starting phaser: *PEW!* And it was,

And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the galaxial fair! And the alien said, ""Y̡̙̯̲̲͕̙͍a̤̲̻͙̤ ̝̠̗̣͠k̤͓̖͇̥̞͘ͅn͓̯̩̦͞o͙̯̼̞͙̞w̛͈,̷͖͎̜̹̦̜ ̳ͅy̹̗̥͕͙̺͡o̗̙̮̳u̲̬͓̺ ̧ͅo̳̘̣͓͟u̦̝̺͙̭̙g̫̲̼͙̬̯̻ḫ̬̦͈̫̦́t͔͔̭̳̞a̢̮ ͕̱̜̻̘̝̹e̸͚̳͎̟̳n҉̪̟͇t̡͍͔͙̰͚̩̰e̱͎̬̪̟̪̟̕r͇͚͇ ̴̬̠̭̼̮t̳̖̣͟h̜͍o͏͓̻̱̯s̭͔̰͚e̠͖̤̹ ͍̳͕̣̮͓̝h̭̞͉̗̞̠o̙̼̼͓̞r̥̣̗ͅșḛ̶̼͔̮͇͕s̨̝ ̫̳̜̗o̞ͅf͉͍͎͙ ͚̹̞̼̺̞͟y̖͇͇͙̰̖̣ò͖͓͔̘͈ͅu̯̩̪̖͞r͘s̫͇ ̲̀ḭ̷̠̭̲̲n͈̮̣̫͞ ̼̥͓̣͈̙͡th͙̲̫͇̖͙͓͠e͞ ̬̟͎͖͍͜g̣̠̝̭͖̣̰a͈͔͕̖l͓̩a҉̼̤̺x̵͎̫͇̝̣ͅi͙͔͓͕̲a̻̙l̘͙̜͚ ̷̹̙͓f̛͈̳̟̝a͎̠i̞̲̯̪̻̼r̗̰̟͍̦̦͢!̰!"" And the farmer said, ""Ya know, I might just do that.""  

  
And he did! The farmer brought Razzle and Dazzle to the race, and they lined up, and the head of the galaxial fair raised his starting holographic gun projection: *BLAM!* (As recorded with secret microphones at the earlier World's Fair.) And it was,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle,  
Dazzle,  
Razzle, by a nose!  
  
And it just so happened that at the farm was the head of the intrauniversal fair! And the alien said,""Ya know, you oughta enter those horses of yours in the intrauniversal fair!"" (Why the alien could speak English is currently unknown and hotly debated among the scientific community, as is how the ho-hum farmer actually went to these events.) And the farmer said, ""Nah. I'm tired.""  
  
And so this farmer went back to the farm, and he grew old. He eventually died, as all things do, aged dog still by his side, with Razzle and Dazzle still grazing in the fields. 
  
One day, an old and grey Razzle turned to a slightly older, if not as grey, Dazzle.  
Razzle said, ""Ya know, in all those races we had, you never beat me. Not once.""  
Dazzle said, ""Yup.""  
Razzle said, ""Wanna have one last race? For old time's sake?""  
Dazzle said, ""Yup.""  
  
And so Razzle and Dazzle went to the starting line. And they waited for the starting gun. And waited some more. And then Razzle realized that they had no one to fire the gun! They began looking around for maybe a passerby who could fire the gun for them, when the dog trodded up to them! He said, ""I can fire the gun for you!""  
And Razzle looked at Dazzle, and Dazzle looked at Razzle, and said, ""Look! A talking dog!""","There once was a farmer, and he had two horses. [Warning: extremely long]",7
