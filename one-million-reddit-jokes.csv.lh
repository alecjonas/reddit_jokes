""Honey, the man next to me has his fly open!""

Her husband tells her, ""Just ignore him!""

The second couple admitted that they often squabble and usually end up cursing at each other and sometimes in front of the kids.  The third couple said that they like to watch porn and have sex several times a week.

The first couple he challenged to abstain from any alcohol for one month, the second he challenged to only say nice things to each other for one month, and to the third, he challenged that they forever give up pornography and to abstain from sex for one month.

At the end of the month, the thee couples met with the priest again. He asked each how the did on their challenge.  The first couple said it was tough at first, but they made it the entire month without a single drop of alcohol and don't even crave it anymore. He praised them and welcomed them into the church. The second couple said they both got upset with each other several times, but have been able to hold their tongue and are actually getting along much better now. He congratulated them and welcomed them into the church. When it got to be the third couples time, the priest noticed they both had their heads down and asked how they did. The man responded that they really had a hard time getting rid of the porn collection, but it had all been burned. The priest commended him and asked how abstaining from sex had gone. The guy responded that it went well until last week, stating ""My wife was wearing a short skirt and bent over in front of me. I saw she wasn't wearing any panties and I just couldn't take it anymore. I just fucked her right there. I really couldn't help it. It's not her fault though.""

As everyone knows, 
Lives Adam and Eve, 
Without any clothes. 
In this garden, 
Were two little leaves, 
One covered Adam's, 
One covered Eve's. 
As the story goes on, 
Never the less to say, 
The wind came along, 
And blew the leaves away. 
At the sight, 
Adam did stare, 
There was Eve's treasure, 
All covered with hair. 
And wonder came, 
Under Eve's eyes, 
As Adam's thing, 
Started to rise. 
They found a spot, 
That suited them best, 
A nice big tree, 
Where they began to rest. 
Her legs spread wider, 
And wider apart, 
While thrill after thrill, 
Came into her heart. 
The head of Adam's thing, 
Peeked into the hole, 
And filled her with passion, 
Beyond her control. 
Backward and forward, 
His thing did slide, 
And Eve's treasure, 
Was all wet inside. 
The joy was good, 
She wouldn't let loose, 
Until Adam's thing, 
Was all out of juice. 
Then down through the years, People did screw, 
And now it is time, 
For me and you. 
So pull down your pants, 
And lay in the grass, 
Cause I'm in the mood, 
For a piece of that ASS",Garden of Eden,0

After a while, he grew tired of people ridiculing him all the time, and decided to prove all of them wrong! He would make the biggest, most beautiful boat the world had ever seen, that floats!

And he worked on this boat for years and years, but when he finally showed it to the people, they only laughed at him once again: ""There's no chance that this boat will float for more than a few seconds!"" they said.

But so confident was he, that it would float, that he decided to prove it himself! He would be the first one to sail it!

The day finally arrives, and he's incredibly nervous. As he pushes the boat out into the water, he keeps telling himself: ""This has to work, it must work, it will work!""

But despite all his efforts, it doesn't go well...

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.

That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".

Now Chip hasn’t always been the brightest bulb, and he’s been known to need some time to process big changes.

As Chip and Dan are doing their rounds one afternoon, Dan sees a cantina up the street. He leans over to his friend and says, “Hey Chip, lets swing by that bar and take a load off.” 

Now it takes Chip a moment to think it over when he says, “Dan, we can’t go into that there bar. We’re Privates, and only Sergeants and above can hangout off base!”

Dan laughs at his dull friend and retorts, “Chip, bud, we aren’t Privates, we’re Sergeants now!” And they saunter on in.

The duo head in and take two stools and Dan wastes no time ordering two cold beers over. Now Chip starts getting nervous and he leans over to Dan and whispers, “Dan I don’t know about this... Privates aren’t supposed to drink! Only Sergeants and above are allowed to consume alcohol!”

Dan chuckles, shaking his head at his simple friends worries; “Chip ol’ pal, your forgetting; Privates can’t drink, but we’re Sergeants now! Take a load off!” And upon this realization, Chip relaxes a little and the two enjoy a few more beers together.

The night rolls on and the two get pretty tipsy when later in the evening Dan draws the attention of a young prostitute. She is very interested in Dan, but she leans over and whispers to him, “Baby I think your very cute, I’d love to show you a good time, I’ve just got Gonorrhea so I’ll let you decide if you want me tonight.”

Now Dan isn’t too fluent in Vietnamese, so he leans over to Chip and asks, “Chip, can you do me a favor. I don’t know what ‘Gonorrhea’ means; Can you run back to base and see what you can find out? If it’s a good thing, just give me a thumbs up and I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”

Chip agrees, runs back to base, and about an hour later returns to the door of the bar and gives Dan a thumbs up and an all clear.

A week goes by and Dan is in the medical wing on base groaning and moaning about his unfortunate ailment when Chip comes by to visit him.

“Damn it Chip! You said Gonorrhea was a good thing!,” shouted Dan.

“No,” said Chip smiling, “You see, I looked it up, and Gonorrhea effects only the privates, but you don’t need to worry because we’re Sergeants now.”",Two Soldiers Walk Into A Bar...,1541

the Cheerio, let's call him Chester, had always wanted to visit Honey Nut Cheerio World, which was basically like heaven with everyone there living the good life, with tons of money and a great, happy, comfortable life in general. But, there was no way to get from Honey Nut Cheerio world to normal Cheerio world. So, Chester wishes to live in Honey Nut Cheerio World, but the Genie (stingy as he is) says, ""I can do that, but my powers only let you be there for 24 hours"". Chester realized he was okay with this and was immediately transported to Honey Nut Cheerio world.

Once there, Chester was amazed by everything, everyone wore the latest trends, looked amazing and seemed like they were having a great time. Since he had only 24 hours, he decided to make the most of his time. As he was deciding what to do, a stranger came up to him and said ""Hey, you're not from around here. What are you doing here?"" Chester explained his situation and the stranger, Buzz. Buzz then decided to be Chester's tour guide through Honey Nut Cheerio world. 

First, they decided to go to a movie. However the line for the movie was almost 5 blocks long. Eventually, after 3 hours they make it to the front of the line and get to watch the movie which lasted 2 hours. 

Then, they decided to get some food to eat at the fanciest restaurant in Honey Nut Cheerio world. However this place was even more crowded than the theater, The line went 3 blocks south and then around a corner and further back 4 blocks east and then 1 north.  Eventually after 5 hours, starving, they make it to the front of the line and order their food, the best darn food that Chester had ever eaten. 

Next, to burn off the calories from the meal, they decided to go shopping at a mall and buy new clothes. However, just to enter the mall, the line was ridiculously long, it was 10 blocks west and then 4 blocks north and then a further 3 blocks west.  Eventually they got into the mall and Chester realized he had only 7 hours left. quickly they shopped within an hour and left. 

The last thing that Chester wanted to do was go to one of the parties in Honey Nut Cheerio world, he had heard that they were mind blowing and we're like nothing he'd ever seen before. 

They get to the party but the line was 2 hours long, but he realized it was worth it to wait since they had waited in worse lines. Once they got in, Chester was amazed by everything he saw. Imagine a party thrown by Great Gatsby except in the modern era. Just being in such an extravagant place made Chester feel like all of the day was worth it. 

Chester felt thirsty after waiting in line so long so he went to get something to drink for himself and Buzz.

Thankfully, there was no punch line.",There lived a Cheerio in Cheerio world who found a magic lamp,0

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay.""

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!
The frog then inquired about her third wish, but was interrupted by her saying, ""Haha, I don't have a husband!""

Night after night, the court physicians and veterinarians watched the dog, the Queen herself often feeding the blind, half-starved animal with an eye dropper.

One morning, after worrying all night, the King and Queen shed tears of joy when the little animal struggled out of his bed and took his first steps.

newcomers at the newcomer's new apartment, should the new resident be alright with it. John, upon learning of this, happily agrees.


After John gets cozy in his new apartment, after getting everything unpacked and set up, about a week after he moves in, the welcoming party is thrown at his apartment. Each of the residents that attend give John a welcoming gift. Sarah brings John a nice lamp that goes well with the currently established atmosphere of the apartment. Nate gives John a nice throw pillow.


After a while, many of the building's residents have arrived. Suddenly, there is an odd clanking knock at the door. As John opens it, he finds a creepy-looking hooded figure. It's a man in a trench coat; his face is obscured by the hood of the coat. He stands there, in a hunched posture. As John checks him out, he notices that the man has a hook where one of his hands should be. That's why the knock sounded weird. Weirdly, the wound looks relatively fresh.

""Welcome to the building,"" says the creepy man in a raspy voice, as he hands John his gift. The gift turns out to be a jar, but not an empty one. John reluctantly takes the jar. 

He asks the man, ""What is this?""

The man replies, ""It's a jar.""

""I know it's a jar,"" says John, ""I meant, what's in the jar?""

In an even darker, raspier voice than before, the man says, 
""My hand.""",Welcome to the building.,0

Jim Bob thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave.

The next day, Bubba goes down to the college and meets the Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic. ""Logic?"" Bubba says. ""What's that?""

The dean says, ""I'll show you. Do you own a weedeater?""

""Yeah.""

""Then logically speaking, because you own a weedeater, I think that you would have a yard.""

""That's true, I do have a yard.""

""I'm not done,"" the dean says. ""Because you have a yard, I think logically that you would have a house.""

Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."" Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"" ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."" Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",The Dave Joke,377

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

 

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

 

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

 

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

""Guys, I think I fucked up.""","3 men are walking through a forest on their way back home, when they stumble upon a lamp.",21
