Having no choice he started walking on the side of the road, hoping to get a lift to the nearest town. It was dark and raining. And pretty soon he got wet and was shivering. The night rolled on and no car passed by, the rain was so heavy he hardly saw a few feet ahead of him.

Suddenly he saw a car coming towards him. It slowed and then stops next to him - without thinking the guy opened the door and jumps in. Seated in the back, he leaned forward to thank the person who had saved him. He realizes there is nobody behind the wheel!!!

Even though there's no one in the front seat and no sound of any engine, the car starts moving slowly. The guy looks at the road ahead and sees a curve coming. Scared almost to death he starts to pray, begging the Lord for his life. He hasn't come out of shock, when just before he hits the curve, a hand appears through the window and moves the wheel! The car makes the curve safely and continues on the road to the next bend. The guy, now paralyzed in terror, watches how the hand appears every time they are before a curve and moves the steering wheel just enough to get the car around each bend.

Finally, the guy sees lights ahead. Gathering his courage he wrenches open the door of the silent, slowly moving car, scrambles out and runs as hard as he can towards the lights. It's a small town.

He stumbles into a dhaba (a typical highway restaurant in India), and asks for a drink, and breaks down. Then he starts talking about the horrible experience he's just been through.

There is dead silence in the dhaba when he stops talking...

...and that's when Santa and Banta Singh walk into the dhaba. Santa points and says ""Look Banta - that's the weird guy who got into our car when we were pushing it.",Scary,1

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing.

He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out ""Oh my God!....""
Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.
Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?""

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?""

""Very well,"" said the voice.
The light went out.
The river ran again.
And the sounds of the forest resumed.
And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke:

""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful...AMEN!""",The Atheist and the Bear,75

He breaks right to take a shortcut down a less-traveled alleyway. He kicks a pile of crumpled newspaper out of his path, but his shoe hits a hard and heavy object. Suddenly a gust of wind and a flash of light exposes a beautiful golden lamp as a powerful genie erupts from it.

""You have three wishes. Choose wisely.""

""Oh wow this is great! Ok um--""

The genie interupts, ""For everything you wish, your mother-in-law receives twice.""

A little disappointed, the greedy business man takes another moment to rethink his first wish. But, there was simply no way around it.

""Okay genie, I wish that I was the CEO of my company.""

The man's wish is granted, but alas, his already narcissistic mother-in-law is now the CEO of **two** big companies.

Behind a devilish grin the man in the nice suit says, ""I wish to have the most beautiful woman as my girlfriend.""

Somewhere in another part of the United States, a confused mother-in-law shoos two beautiful lesbians from off her front porch.

Preparing for his last wish, the man takes a few minutes to think things through.

""I've got it, Genie. I want you to beat me half to death."" *



 \* ""I would like to be beaten such that if my mother-in-law were to receive the exact same beating twice, she would die, immediately, from her injuries, but also such that I could easily survive just one of these beatings."" /u/Brawldud

The waiter replies, 

""Well you see, our restaurant is one of the most efficient restaurants in the state. Statistically, you are ten times more likely to drop your spoon than any other utensil. By carrying one in our apron, we save over 4 hours a week of going to the back for a replacement.""

As the waiter reaches over to place the food, the man notices something very peculiar. The waiter has a string coming out of his fly. Distracted by this, the man reaches for his spoon only to push it off the table. Statistics prove to be true.

Like a gunslinger, the waiter draws the spare spoon from his hip and gives it to the man. Before he knows it, the waiter is gone.

Halfway through his soup the man gets the waiter's attention after several failed attempts. Discreetly, the man beckons the waiter to come in closer.  The man discreetly alerts the waiter that there is a string stuck in his fly. The waiter then explains,

""Well you see, I have it there intentionally. Us guys, we attach the strings to our... You know... So that when we use the bathroom we can just simply give it a pull and avoid getting our hands dirty. We have saved over 10 hours a week of unnecessary hand washing!""

The man at first satisfied with the answer, puzzlingly asks,

""Okay so I understand how you get it out, but how do you get it back in?""

""I don't know about the other waiters. I use a spoon""",The efficient restaurant,263

I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck causing him to have to drive on to the shoulder. This evidently pissed the driver off enough, that he hung out his window and flipped the woman off.

 ""Man, that guy is stupid"" I thought to myself I ALWAYS smile wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why:

 I drive 38 miles each way every day to work, that's 76 miles. Of these, 16 each way, is bumper-to-bumper, most of the bumper-to-bumper is on 8 lane highway. So if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 34 miles is not bumper to bumper.

 I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day.

 Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000.

 In any given group of females 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That's 642.

 According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449, according to the National Institutes of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98, and 34% describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33.

 According to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing.

 That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that, has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period and is ARMED!

No matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.

The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.

The question was: What do women really want?

Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. Well, since it was better than death, the accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.

He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.

The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises...etc ....etc. He

had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden.

Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question: What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.

Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared.

And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom. What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish. Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display, and generally made everyone very uncomfortable. The wedding night approached: Gawain, steeling himself for an horrific night, entered the bedroom. 

What a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened. The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day, and which during the night?

What a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament: During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments?

What would you do? What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read until you've made your own choice.

Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself.

Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.

What is the moral of this story? The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly, underneath it all, she's still a witch---and don't you forget it.

 ..., his axe fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, ""Why are you crying?""

The woodcutter replied that his axe had fallen into the water, and he needed the axe to make his living.

The Lord went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe. ""Is this your axe?"" the Lord asked.

The woodcutter replied, ""No."" The Lord again went down and came up with a silver axe. ""Is this your axe?"" the Lord asked.

Again, the woodcutter replied, ""No.""

The Lord went down a third time and came up with an iron axe. Is this your axe?"" the Lord asked.

The woodcutter replied, ""Yes.""

The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all three axes to keep, and the woodcutter went home happy.

Some time later the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the riverbank, and his wife fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked him, ""Why are you crying?"" ""Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!""

The Lord went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez.

""Is this your wife?"" asked the Lord.

""Yes,"" cried the woodcutter.

The Lord was furious. ""You lied! That is not the truth!""

The woodcutter replied, ""Oh, forgive me Lord, it is a misunderstanding.

You see, if I had said 'no' to Jennifer Lopez, You would have come up with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then if I also said 'no' to her, You would have come up with my wife. Had I then said 'yes,' you would have given all three to me.

Lord, I am a poor man, and I'm not able to take care of three wives, so THAT'S why I said yes to Jennifer Lopez.""

The moral of this story is: Whenever a man lies, it is for a good and honorable reason, and for the benefit of others.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared. 

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?' 

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded. 

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?' 

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.' 

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find. 

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. 

'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The man replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.' 

'How can you be so sure?' the Chief asked.

The husband reading while the wife quietly knits. Breaking the silence, the husband leans gently to one side, and unleashes an egregious fart. His wife crumples her face and writhes in near agony next to him, bemoaning the ubiquitous ass mist that was only exentuated by the humid summer evening. 

""What the hell was that all about??"" The wife cried. 

""It's Fart Football!"" The husband proudly chirped. ""That beauty was worth 6 points."" He then grunted whilst clenching his bowels, squeaking out a lone toot. ""There's an extra point!""

The wife's disgusted face quickly turned into a coy smile.
""Oh, you call that a fart? That's no fart, THIS is a fart."" Enveiling an ass blast reminiscent of Louis Armstrong, the wife vibrated the whole bed with the power of a dozen Nokia cell phones. ""Hail Mary touch down!"" With no hesitation, she let out a less volumness, but still respectable aftershock. ""2 point conversion! Whaddyaknow!""

Now this emasculatory display made the husband none too happy. As the wife sat, arms folded in apparent victory, he conjured up all his strength as he clutched the bed posts for leverage. A lone drop of sweat ran down his nose as he called upon divine strength to secure his man hood. Unerring to his bodily instincts, blinded by the pursuit of honor, his efforts brought him so close, yet so far; he shat the bed.

A retired corporate executive decided to take a vacation.   He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life...   until the boat sank!   He found himself on an island with no other people,   no supplies,   nothing,   only bananas and coconuts.
After about four months,   he is lying on the beach one day,   when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.   In disbelief,   he asks her,   ""Where did you come from?   How did you get here?""
She replies,   ""I rowed from the other side of the island.   I landed here when my cruise ship sank.""
""Amazing,""   he says.   ""You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you.""
""Oh,   this?""   replies the woman.   ""I made the boat out of raw material I found on the island.   The oars were whittled from gum tree branches.   I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree.""
""But,   where did you get the tools?""
""Oh,   that was no problem,""   replied the woman.   ""On the south side of the island,   a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed.   I found if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln,   it melted into forgeable,   conductile iron.   I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware.""
The guy is stunned.
""Let's row over to my place,""   she says.   After a few minutes of rowing,   she docks the boat at a small wharf.   As the man looks to shore,   he nearly falls out off the boat.   Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.   While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope,   the man can only stare ahead,   dumb struck.
As they walk into the house,   she says casually,   ""It's not much,   but I call it home sit down,   please.   Would you like a drink?""
""No.   No thank you,""   he says,   still dazed.   ""Can't take any more coconut juice.""   ""It's not coconut juice,""   the woman replies.   ""I have a still.   How about a Pina Colada?""
Trying to hide his continued amazement,   the man accepts,   and they sit down on her couch to talk.   After they have exchanged their stories,   the woman announces,   ""I'm going to slip into something more comfortable.   Would you like to take a shower and shave?   There is a razor upstairs in the bathroom cabinet.""
No longer questioning anything,   the man goes into the bathroom.   There,   in the cabinet,   is a razor made from a bone handle.   Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.
""This woman is amazing,""   he muses.   ""What next?""
When he returns,   she greets him wearing nothing but vines-strategically positioned,   and smelling faintly of gardenias.   She beckons for him to sit down next to her.
""Tell me,""   she begins suggestively,   slithering closer to him,   ""We've been out here for a really long time.   You've been lonely.   There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now,   something you've been longing for all these months?""   She stares into his eyes.
He can't believe what he's hearing.   ""You mean...""   he swallows excitedly and tears start to form in his eyes...   "".....   I can check my e-mail from here?""",The Island Castaway,12

I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.

When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, ""You don't understand. ... Sex keeps me awake at night."" The clerk said, ""Me too!""

One day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. ""You don't understand,"" I said, ""I hoped to have Sex on TV."" He called me a show off.

When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married."" The Judge said, ""Me too!""

The Hunter lets his fingers brush the fur gently. ""Lion. Shot with a 30 caliber."" He exclaims."" The crowd is amazed and pushes another skin in his hand. The Hunter frowns. ""Rabbit. Choked in a trap."" The evening progresses and the hunter ends up completely drunk. While staggering home he keeps mumbling about animals and weapons to himself. Finally he arrives back home and gets into bed.

When he wakes up the next morning, completely hung over, he notices that he has a shiner of a black eye. Confused he turns to his wife asking what happened to him, since he's sure he was fine when he got into bed.
His wife gives him a dirty look. ""You came home drunk as a skunk yesterday. And when you finally found your way into bed, you shoved your hand in my panties and exclaimed: 'Beaver. Killed with an axe'""

Miraculously, they both survived with minor injuries, so they sent off a signal flare and began rationing their emergency supplies. The food was eaten by the end of the first week, and the water lasted until the end of the second. But they continued weathering the hot days and cool nights, never for one second giving up hope. Almost three weeks passed, and they saw a caravan of jeeps over the horizon. 

They turned to each other, waiving excitedly. But one of the christian men corrects himself  and a worried look rushed over his face. ""Oh crap"", he said. ""These guys are probably muslim!""

His friend rolled his eyes. ""We're in the middle east, Jim. You're probably right. What's your point?""

And Jim, in a huff, replied ""Well, I just think I should tell them I'm Muslim too. Because, well, you know how these people are. Don't you, Ben?""

But before any reply could be made, the convoy of jeeps arrived at the wreckage. An older man wearing a traditional thawb and dark sunglasses stepped out of one of the jeeps and inspected the men standing before the remnants of the plane.

""My friends"", he said in a heavy accent. ""We saw the flare and spent many nights searching the desert for you.""

The two Christian men nodded nervously between each other, then back to the man in the thawb. 

""We will take you back to our city and make sure you are taken care of. But all I ask is that you identify yourself, so that we may greet you as friends.""

""My name is Mohammad"", said Jim. ""And I'm a Muslim."" 

And the man in the thawb nodded solemnly, adjusting his glasses away from the desert sun.

""And my name is Ben"", said Ben. ""And I'm Christian.""

And the man in the thawb again nodded solemly. ""Ben, my friend: you have been through so much hardship over these last three weeks. We shall take you back to our city, where we will give you all the food and water that you need!""

A husband is travelling abroad on a business meeting in a couple of days, and worried that his wife is going to cheat on him, he decides he wants to buy something spicy for her to enjoy while he is away, so she wont need other men to satisfy her needs.


He visits the nearest sex shop, and after looking at different goods, the store owner comes over. He asks the husband what he is looking for, and the husband tells him why hes there. The store owner tells the husband to come out back, where he has something truly special for his wife: a voodo dick.

The husband, curious of course, asks whats so special about this dildo, and the store owner explains:

""This is a magical dildo. Use the codeword voodo dick, and give it a location, and see what happens."" 

The husband looks a bit suspicious at the owner, but says:
""Voodo dick, keyhole"". 

The voodo dick flies into the air, and starts ramming the keyhole over and over. The husband, thrilled with this new fantastic sextoy, pays the store owner and runs back home to show his wife this fantastic invention. She is, of course, ecstatic over this new purchase, and as soon as her husband has gone to the airport, she tells the vodoo dick to help her out. 

After several amazing orgasms, she figures out its enough. But she does not know how to make it stop. After several attempts to tell it to stop, she tries to call the ambulance, but her constant orgasms are making it impossible to speak correctly. She humps out to her car, gets in, and steps on the gas, heading for the hospital.

On the way to the hospital, she sees a couple of blue lights in her rear view mirror, and cursing and moaning at the same time, she pull her car over. An officer comes over, and she desperately tries to explain her self:

""My husband bought a voodo dick for me and I cant make it stop and I need to get to the hospital in a hurry, please, Officer!""

After looking at the woman for a couple of seconds, the police officer replies:

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. 

He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. 

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. 

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peters legs and slammed his stupid ass against the railing, killing him instantly. 

Probably wasn't the same elephant.

After a few laughs and drinks, one of them had to go to the restroom. The ones that stayed behind began to talk about their kids and their successes.

The first guy says: “I am very proud of my son, he is my pride and joy. He started working at a very successful company at the bottom of the barrel. He studied Economics, Business Administration, and was promoted, began to climb the corporate ladder, becoming the General Manager, and now he is the president of the company. He became so rich that he gave his best friend a top of the line Mercedes Benz for his birthday.”

The second guy says: “Damn, that's terrific! My son is also my pride and joy, I am very proud of him. He started working at a travelling agency for a very big airline. He went to flight school to become a pilot and managed to become a partner in the company where he now owns the majority of the assets. He became so rich that he gave his best friend a brand new jet for his birthday.”

The third guy says: “Well, well, well congratulations! My son is also my pride and joy and he is also very rich. He studied in the best universities and became an engineer. He started his own construction company and became very successful and a multi-millionaire. He also gave away some very nice and expensive thing to his best friend for his birthday. He built a 30,000 sq. ft. mansion especially for his friend.”

The three friends congratulated each other mutually for the successes of their sons. The fourth friend who earlier had gone to restroom returned and asked: “What's going on, what are all the congratulations for?” One of the three said: “We were talking about the pride we feel for the successes of our sons. What about your son?”

The fourth man replied: “My son is Gay and he makes a living dancing as a stripper at a nightclub.”

The three friends said: “What a shame that must be, that is horrible, what a disappointment you must feel.”

The fourth man replied: “No, I am not ashamed. Not at all. He is my son and I love him just as well, he is my pride and joy. In addition, he is very lucky too. Did you know that his birthday just passed and the other day he received a beautiful 30,000 sq. ft. mansion, a brand new jet, and a top of the line Mercedes Benz from his three boyfriends?”",Four proud fathers.,516

I wonder what he wants.

SL : It's logical.
He wants to rape us.

SM : Oh, no !
At this rate he will reach us in 4 minutes at the most !

SL : The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.....

SM : It's not working.

SL : Of course it's not working.

He started to walk faster, too.

SM : So, what shall we do?

SM : Yes, yes !

We moved into our new house in Canada. I'm so excited. It's so nice. The mountains are beautiful. I cannot wait to see them covered with the snow.  
October 14,  
Canada. It is the most beautiful country in the world. Leaves turned all colors and shades of yellow and orange. I drove across country and saw deer. They are so graceful. These are the most beautiful animals in the world. This must be the paradise. I love Canada.  
November 11,  
Remembrance Day (Canada's national holiday). Deer hunting will begin soon. I cannot imagine how someone could kill such a beautiful animal. I hope that it will snow soon. It's so beautiful.  
December 2,  
Tonight we got the first snow. I got up and saw all covered with white blanket. It looks like a beautiful postcard. We went outside; cleaned up the stairs and driveway, then had a snowball fight (I won). When snow plow passed by we had to re-clean the gate. What a great country. I love Canada.  
December 12,  
Tonight, snow again. Again snow plow passed by and buried gate. Here is so beautiful.  
December 19,  
Tonight, snow again. I could not get the car out to go to work. Here is really wonderful, just a little tired of shoveling. Again f**** snow plow.  
December 22,  
This white shit was falling the whole last night. I got blisters from shoveling and my back aches. This monkey with a snow plow is waiting around the corner for me to clean up at the gate. What an asshole.  
December 25,  
Merry  shitty f****  Christmas. Again crappy snow. If I ever get my hands on this fagot that drives a snow plow, I'll kill him. Mother f***** why don’t they sprinkle more salt on the road so it dissolves faster.  
December 27,  
Tonight, snow again. I have not been out for three days except when I clean the snow after the snow plow passes. I cannot go anywhere, the car got stuck in the mountains, the snow is in front of the gate and it's cold. They say that tonight will get another 30 cm of that shit.  
December 28,  
The weather prognosis was bad. It fell half a meter. At this rate it will not melt until summer. The snow plow is stuck and that asshole came to me to ask for a shovel. I told him that I already broke six shovels cleaning that shit from the doorsteps as he tossed it, and I almost broke the shovel on his head.  
January 4,  
I am finally out of the house. I went to the store to buy some food and when I returned the car I hit the deer. $ 3,000 damage to the car. That f**** beast should be killed. They're everywhere. Why were they not killed by hunters in autumn ...  
May 3,  
I drove the car to the mechanic. It's amazing how rusty it is from the f**** salt sprinkled everywhere.  
May 10,  
I'm moving to Florida. I cannot imagine why would a normal person want to live in the f****** Canada.

They hired a lovely lass for the job.
 
 
She worked out fine, was a good cook, was polite, and kept the house neat. One day, after about six months, she came in and said she would have to quit.
 

""But why?"" asked the disappointed wife.
 

She hemmed and hawed and said she didn't want to say, but the wife was persistent, so finally she said, ""Well on my day off a couple of months ago I met this good-looking fellow from over in the next county, and well, I'm pregnant.""
 

The wife said, ""Look, we don't want to lose you. My husband and I don't have children, and we'll adopt your baby if you will stay.""
 

She talked to her husband; he agreed, and the maid said she would stay. The baby came, they adopted it, and all went well.
 

After several months though, the maid came in again and said that she would have to quit. The wife questioned her, found out that she was pregnant again, talked to her husband, and offered to adopt the baby if she would stay. She agreed, had the baby, they adopted it, and life went on as usual.
 

In a few months, however, she again said she would have to leave. Same thing. She was pregnant. They made the same offer, she agreed, and they adopted the third baby. She worked for a week or two, but then said, ""I am definitely leaving this time.""
 

""Don't tell me you're pregnant again?"" asked the lady of the house.
 

""No,"" she said, ""there are just too many kids here to pick up after.""

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know
the defense attorney?' 
She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr.
Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died. 

The judge asked both counselors to approach the
bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, 'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'

He sits down at the bar and orders a drink. He sits there solemnly sipping his drink. On the end of the bar, he sees a glass jug completely stuffed with 20 dollar bills. It catches his attention, so he calls the bartender over and says, ""Hey pal, what up with that jug?""

The bartender smiles and says, ""Oh that? That's a prize. There's a horse out back behind the bar. You put 20 bucks into the jar. If you can make the horse laugh, you win the entire contents of the jar.""

Easy enough, the man says to himself. He takes a 20 out of his wallet, stuffs it into the jar, and heads towards the back door. As he is walking, the bartender calls out, ""Good luck pal. That horse hasn't laughed since he's been here."" The man shrugs and keeps on walking. The bartender is looking out of the back window as the man leans into the horse and whispers something in the horse's ear. The horse starts laughing uncontrollably. The man smiles, walks back in, finishes his drink, takes the jar of money, and leaves. On his way out, he winks at the bartender.

A few months later, the same man walks into the same bar. He sees another jar full of 20s. He pulls another 20 out and says to the bartender, ""Hey! Do I have to make him laugh again?"" The bartender looks at him questionably and says, ""No. Now you have to make him cry."" The man smiles, stuffs his 20 into the jar and heads out back. The bartender is looking, again, through the back window. This time, the man didn't whisper anything. He looked at the horse and then looked down. The horse looked at the man, and then looked down as well. Without another moment passing, the horse is a blubbering teary mess, weeping beyond belief. The man walks back into the bar, grabs the jar, winks at the bartender, and heads out.

The bartender is irate. ""Hold up,"" he yells, ""First, you made the horse laugh when no one else could. Then, you made him cry when no one else could! You have to tell me what you said!""

The man stops, and turns around to the bartender, ""Well, first, I had to make him laugh so I told him my dick was bigger then his, and he laughed. The second time, I showed him"".

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.
Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.
""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

So, much to my mother's dismay, I booked myself a flight and took off alone to meet my culinary destiny.

When I arrived in Bruges, I found my way to my hostel, where I met a lovely Norwegian girl who introduced herself as Sieglinde who seemed to share my interest in food, because she kept asking me what my wienerschnitzel was like. She became very excited when I told her it was among the best you could find in the States, but then seemed confused when I told her I prepared it with cajun seasoning, ground pepper, and garlic, and shortly thereafter she politely excused herself. Maybe I should have left the garlic out of it, on reflection, seeing as how she wasn't Italian. Probably just didn't have a taste for the stuff.

Anyway, the next morning I arose early and made my way to Le Nie, where I found myself greeted by a portly, jovial man in a vest, who introduced himself as Rassior don Guerres, the restaurant's maitre d'. I told him my name and said the chef was expecting me, and he smiled and indicated that I proceed to the kitchen, which I did.

I greeted the chef and shook his hand, we discussed the specifics of my apprenticeship, and he introduced me to the other apprentice he had taken on, a beautiful young Argentinian girl who wasted no time once the chef had left earshot in asking me about my burrito. I raised an eyebrow at her and asked her which one she meant, because I can make many different varieties of burritos, and would indeed be willing to do so for a hot tamale like her. She looked at me in befuddlement and then became very interested in her phone. I think I slipped up by forgetting that tamales are not Argentinian and they don't have them in Belgium anyway.

Anyway, we got over our rocky start and quickly became good friends, working under the guidance of Chef Shilo Bouffe (he explained that his father had been French, while his mother was Hebrew), who spent the first few weeks introducing us to the delicate art of making frittes.

He was very insistent that I needed to include a lot of mayonnaise on my fritte, or else it would not marinate properly and that Belgian quality so inherent to the item would be lost. I took careful heed and always made sure my frittes were covered in a thick layer of delicious mayonnaise.

This served me well in my first assessment, but it seemed that my Argentinian friend was not so cognizant, or perhaps encountered a language barrier. When her assessment arrived, her fritte didn't have nearly enough mayonnaise on it, and Shilo flipped his lid.

""What do you call this?"" he barked at her. ""It's all wrong, it's missing all of its character!""

""What do you mean?"" she said, tearfully. ""What did I forget?""

""Ayy!"" he said, angrily. ""Le mayo!""

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

Upon examination, the veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat.  To make matters worse, there was no male gorilla available. In a desperate hope to solve the problem, the Zoo Keeper approached a local redneck, Bobby Lee with a proposition. Would he be willing to mate with the gorilla for $500.00?

Bobby Lee showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under four conditions.


""First"", Bobby Lee said, ""I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips."" The Keeper quickly agreed to this condition. 

""Second"", he said, ""You can't never tell no one about this."" The Keeper again readily agreed to this condition. 

""Third"", Bobby Lee said, ""I want all the children raised Southern Baptist."" Once again it was agreed. 

And last, Bobby Lee said, ""I'll need another week to come up with the $500.00.""

Dear Ma and Pa: 

I am well. Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled. I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late. 

Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water. 

Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon,etc.,but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much. 

We go on ""route"" marches, which the Platoon Sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A ""route march"" is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat. 

The Sergeant is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors and Colonels just ride around and frown. They don't bother you none. This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes. 

Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain't like fighting with that ole bull at home. I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake. He joined up the same time as me. But I'm only 5'6"" and 130 pounds and he's 6'8"" and weighs near 300 pounds dry. 


Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in. 

Your loving daughter, Gail

Fred put down his club, took his hat off, and waited for the entire procession to pass.  As soon as the cars were gone he put his hat back on and started addressing the ball again.  Harry said, ""Damn, Fred.  That was a really nice thing you did, waiting for the funeral to pass like that.""

""Hello, President Obama” a heavily accented southern voice said. ""This is Archie, down here at Joe's Catfish Shack, in Mobile , and I am callin' to tell ya’ll that we are officially declaring war on y'all!""


""Well Archie,"" Barack replied, ""This is indeed important news! How big is your army?""


""Right now,"" said Archie, after a moments calculation ""there is myself, my cousin Harold, my next-door-neighbor Randy, and the whole dart team from Hooters. That makes eight!""


Barack paused. ""I must tell you Archie that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command.""


""Wow,"" said Archie. ""I'll have to call ya back!""
Sure enough, the next day, Archie called again. “Mr. Obama, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!""


""And what equipment would that be Archie?"" Barack asked.


""Well sir, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Harry’s farm tractor.""


President Obama sighed. ""I must tell you Archie, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also I've increased my army to one and a half million since we last spoke.""


""Lord above"", said Archie, ""I'll be getting back to ya.""


Sure enough, Archie called again the next day. “President Obama! I am sorry to have to tell you that we have had to call off this here war.""


""I'm sorry to hear that"" said Barack. ""Why the sudden change of heart?""


Well, sir,"" said Archie, ""we've all sat ourselves down and had a long chat over sweet tea, and come to realize that there's just no way we can feed that many prisoners.""",The South Declares War,20

Growing up in the lab, among hippy scientists and political idealists talking about the socialist revolution and liberation he thought one day, one day, he would have his freedom. Later that year, in an act of civil defiance within the chicken coop, he refused to eat the chicken feed alloted to him. As the scientists opened the cage to seize the dissident chicken, he pecked him in the eye and liberated his brothers and sisters. However, the real world was not what the chicken had expected. The rampant commercialism he saw upon his release disillusioned the young chicken to the extent that he decided to take his own life. Rising in the morning, at his usual time at 6 a.m., he leaned over and kissed his wife delicately upon the cheek, a solitary tear running down his eye as he imagined the child he knew he would never meet. The chicken stepped into the cold London morning, the frost chaffing his cheeks, the sleet crashing against his breast. Taking one step onto the busy dual-carriageway, he closed his eyes and imagined heaven....",Why did the chicken cross the road?,3
