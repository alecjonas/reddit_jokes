There was a village next to theirs that was famous during the summertime, that time there were weddings almost every second day, and allot of shooting and dancing as a sign of celebration. So they wait out the spring, and they leave the dog in the  summer.

Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.

CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave of two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.

CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.

CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.

CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !

CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.

FRANK: You could puta Grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.

CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry isa good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

FRANK: - - - - - Mama?- - - (Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).","Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:",11

The next day, she took the calculator in to class and started using it. The moment she started hitting the keys, she heard a guitar playing country music. Startled, she stopped and put it back in her bag. During a break, she investigated further. She keyed in 2+2 and the guitar started again.  

That’s odd, she thought, but I’m sure it’s nothing. It’s just a little annoying.

She went on to do her homework with the device, but by the end of the day, she was so sick of it playing music that she decided to take it to a service shop. 

“Can I help you?” asked the employee. 

“My parents gave this to me yesterday. It’s brand new, but I think there’s something wrong with it,” she said as she handed the calculator over. 

The employee pressed a few buttons and guitar began. When he stopped, the music stopped as well. 

“What’s the problem?” he asked. 

This took the girl by surprise. “Well, it’s the music.”

“Okay,” replied the employee. 

This has to be a joke, she thought, and continued: “I started doing addition and subtraction and it started playing some country music.”

“Okay,” he replied again. 

“And then I tried multiplication and division, and I know this sounds crazy, but a fiddle joined in.”

“Right.”

“By the time I got to my actual calculus work, I swear it was playing zydeco!”

“Well, I don’t really see the problem then,” he said, handing it back. “It’s not going to sing for you. It’s a Texas Instrumental.”",A girl was going to study for her AP exams... [long],144

The Jew asks the park ranger if he can cut the male bear open, so he can retrieve his friend’s remains for a proper burial. The park ranger agrees and goes on to cut open the female bear; the Jew is confused and ask the park ranger why is he cutting the female open when he clearly said his friend is in the male bear.

While walking down the street one day a Member of Parliament is tragically hit by a truck and dies.  
 

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.  
 

'Welcome to heaven,' says St. Peter.  
   
    
 'Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We  seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.'  
 

'No problem, just let me in,' says the man.  
 

'Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher  up.  What  we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven.  Then   you can choose where to spend eternity.'  
 

'Really, I've made up my mind.  I want to be in heaven,' says the MP.  
 

'I'm sorry, but we have our rules.'  
 

And with  that, St. Peter escorts him to the  elevator and he went down, down, down  to hell.  The  doors open and he found himself in the middle of a green golf course.  In  the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other  politicians who had worked with him.  
 

Everyone is very happy and dressed in evening dress. They  run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the  people.  
 

They played a friendly game of golf and then dined on lobster, caviar and champagne  
 

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly &amp; nice guy  who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are having such a  good time that before he realizes it's time to go.  
 

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and wave whilst the elevator rises....  
 

The elevator rises and the door opens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.  
 

'Now it's time to visit heaven.

24  hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from  cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing.  They have a good time  and, before he realizes it, the 24  hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

'Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. now choose your eternity.'  
 

The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers: 'Well, I would never have  said it  before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would  be better off in hell.'  
 

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down,down  to hell.  
 

When the doors open he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.  
 

He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.  
 

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ' I don't understand,' stammers the  MP.  
   
 

'Yesterday  I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate  lobster and caviar, drank champagne, danced and had a great time. Now  there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.   What happened?   
 

The devil looks at him, smiles and says,

The chicken, amazingly, starts to dance hopping from foot to foot. The amazed barman gives the man a drink. He drinks it, thanks the barman and leaves.

Next day he comes in again with the chicken and the bucket. Again he places the bucket down with the barman’s requests and they watch the chicken dance. The barman then has an idea and asks to buy the chicken and bucket as a light entertainment for his bar. The man agrees and sells the man his chicken and bucket for £100. He drinks his drink, thanks the barman and leaves.

The barman advertises the dancing chicken and when he has a lot of folk gathered around he places the chicken on the bucket and tells them all to watch. Nothing happens. Except for a few mutters and grumbles from his patrons.

The next day the man walks back in and the barman confronts him asking why the chicken didn’t dance as he had previously. The man smiled and said

He arrives and gets his own personal tour guide.  As they are hiking through the forest, they come across two large black bears.  The guide tells him to be quiet and not move and the bears should be on their way.  Moshe ignores this advice, grabs his camera as as he's about to take a picture, one of the bears grabs the tour guide and eats him whole.  Moshe hightails it out of there and after what seemed to be hours of running, he comes across the forest ranger.  He tells the ranger the story and the ranger asks Moshe to lead him to the spot.  After a long walk, they come to the clearing and both bears are still there, but there is no sign of the tour guide.  The ranger asks Moshe which bear the guide is in as he needs to euthanize the right bear as it would be dangerous for tours.  Moshe points to the male bear and said, it was definitely that one.  The ranger pulls out his rifle, shoots the bear and the female one scurries off in fear.  He pulls out his knife, cuts the bear open and nothing.

The jar is quite large and full to the brim with what must be thousands of $100 bills. Excited, he asks, ""What are the three tasks?""

The bartender says, ""Well, first you have to drink three straight pints of whiskey without throwing up. That's three entire pints, mind you. Most people can't do it."" 

""Okay,"" the man says, clearly seeing that this is dangerous but doable, ""what's the second task?""

""Through this door, I have a pet alligator, and he has a sore tooth. It's been bothering him for ages. You need to pull his tooth for me.""

""My granny lives upstairs, so I can take care of her. She's lonely and hasn't gotten laid in over 30 years. Go upstairs and make her feel young again.""

The man thinks very hard about these tasks, then nods his head, takes out a fresh, crisp $100 bill and stuffs it into the jar. The bartender pours the three pints of whiskey, which the man promptly starts drinking. It takes him a minute or so, and he nearly vomits, but manages to keep them down. 

He then goes through the doorway, stumbling slightly, to the alligator room. An immense howling is soon heard, grunting, scratching, and some of most painful and excruciating sounds the bartender has ever heard.

For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover.

In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000.

He asked her about the contents.
'When we were to be married,' she said, ' my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.'

The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two Times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with Happiness.

After thinking for a moment, the pigeon told the little girl to wait and he would return.
About an hour went by, then the kindly pigeon returned with 30 of his mates, they all had ropes hanging out of their beaks, and on the end of the ropes was a raft.

The pigeon told the little girl to jump on the raft, and they would take her across to France. 

About half way across the Channel, a storm blew up and the ropes broke. Despite the pigeons' best efforts, the raft sank, and sadly- the little girl drowned.

The moral of this story is:  you can’t be a ballet dancer if you're pigeon towed.

""Very well then,"" the wizard responds. The large oak door creaks ominously open as a gust of musky air hits the man in the face.

The wizard leads the man to a circular stone table, chipped  and worn from years of use. Both men take a seat at the table, the wizard sits in a magnificently crafted dark oak chair with a plush purple seat and back. The man sits opposite the wizard.

The wizard takes out a leather pouch from his robe pocket and places it on the table, carefully extracting small bone fragments from within. His curiosity piqued, the man leans forward. The wizard closes his eyes breathing in deeply, holding his breath, then releasing.

The bones scatter across the table and the wizard begins to decipher the man's fortune. Very suddenly, his brow furrows.

It’s quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some a cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic I know, but it seemed to be a pretty good deal for us because it meant he’d get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He’d always have a shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn’t want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he’d sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours.  

This was shaping up to be a long term passion, so for his 15th birthday I went out and bought him a giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed.  

Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About a month ago I was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I’ve never actually done before. I was immediately hit by a terrible smell – I don’t want to get too into the gross details but I’m a dude, a once 18 year old dude, so I know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don’t clean it. I’m sure we all know what that smells like even after a week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as a kind of Strombidae fleshlight for a long, long time without cleaning it.  

I’m not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you’d think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected a deeper issue my partner and I decided to get some professional help.  

So it’s been about a month of him seeing a behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. I told her it’s been incredibly promising so far. He’s really starting to come out of his shell.

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""","The husband leans over and asks his wife,",58

He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer.

Knowing that one of the teachers at their school was from the UK and maybe had an angel on top of the tree instead of the classic star, they went to ask him about it.

It's a long story he said: It began a very, very long time ago. It was a cold and snowy day, as it usually is on the North Pole. December was almost halfway passed already, but still, no decoration were in place. The elves couldn't make time to decorate as they were busy making toys. And Father Christmas was in a very, very bad mood. So the Christmas angel figured he had to do something to cheer him up so Christmas would be joyful as always. Thus, he cleaned the workshop and the house, tossed out the old take away leftovers and went to look for the decorations. Approaching Father Christmas he asked:

\-What should I do with these decorations? The angel asked.

\-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed back.

The angel figured he put up the decorations and give Father Christmas another day. Maybe the clean house and the decorations would cheer him up. And the next day the angel went to Father Christmas to ask about how he should organize the Christmas gifts on the sleigh. 

\-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed again. 

The angel, not admitting defeat just yet. He let another day pass and figured he should put up the Christmas tree while he were on it. Not entirely sure where to put it, as it never was in the same spot for two years in a row, he meekly approached Father Christmas, hoping he would be in a better mood as Christmas was very, very close.

\-Where do you want the Tree? The angel asked.

\-As far as I'm concerned ..., said Father Christmas. You can take the tree and SHOVE IT UP YOUR...

Off in the horizon they see a house and finally manage to struggle to it. The first guy goes up to the door to ask for water. The door is opened by this really old, wart-covered, puss covered, scaly, toothless old woman.

""C-c-c-can I h-h-h-have some w-w-w-water for me and m-my friends?"" he asks.

She replied, ""I will... if you have sex with me.""

The guy pukes all over the woman and runs back to his friends.

""You guys would not believe who answered the door. Some really gross old lady!"" he tells them. ""She said we could have water if I had sex with her.""

""Why didn't you then?"" asks he second guy.

""Because she was so ugly, I was sick and couldn't do it!""

""Oh, you are such a wuss. I'll go up to the door,"" the second guy says.

He goes up to the door and rings the bell. The old hag answers.

""W-w-w-w-w-w-waaaaaa......"" He uses all of his will power to not hurl.

""Water? Yes, I have water,"" she says knowingly. ""But you have to have sex with me.""

""AAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!""

He runs back to his friends and before he could say a word, the third guy goes to the door and rings the bell.

""What do you want for some water?""

""You have to have sex with me.""

Knowing that if he doesn't do something, he and his friends will all die. So he follows the lady into her kitchen.

""Do me here,"" she told him.

He sees 3 ears of corn on the counter and gets an idea.

""Lay back and close your eyes. And keep them closed!""

The witch lays back and spreads her legs. The guy nearly pukes after seeing this. He picks up an ear of corn and screws her with it. Finally she is finished. He throws the corn out the window.

""Oh, God. That was the best orgasm of my life. If you do that again I will give you a million dollars.""

""Then lay back and close your eyes again.""

This she does and he does her with the second ear of corn until she is satisfied. Then he throws it out the window. This time she doesn't even open her eyes.

""If you do that again, I will give you a Jeep so you can get out of the desert.""

""Eyes closed,"" he says.

Then he does her with the last piece of corn. He brings her to multiple orgasms.

""Ohhhhhhhhh........ The water, money and Jeep are outside,"" she says as she squirms in ecstasy.

So he runs like hell outside and grabs the water and money and jumps into the Jeep. He wonders where his friends are and drives around to find them. He finds them by the window.

One of the guys says to him, ""Hey, man. I hope you had fun. We just ate the three best pieces of buttered corn you could have imagined!""",Dying of dehydration,31

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard, so they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door, if they could spend the night.

""I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed."" she explained. ""And I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.""

""Don't worry."" John said. ""We'll be happy to sleep in the barn and if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.""

The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way and enjoyed a great weekend of golf.

But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney.

It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the golf weekend.

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, ""Keith, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our golf holiday in Scotland about 9 months ago?""

""Yes, I do."" said Keith.

""Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?""

""Well, um, yes!"" Keith said, a little embarrassed about being found out, ""I have to admit that I did.""

""And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?""

Keith's face turned beet red and he said, ""Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?""

Jerry: ""Haha, to defeat, the huns?""

B: ""Jerry what are you talking about?""

J: ""Oh, you weren't doing a reference?""

B: ""No. As I was saying I'm looking forward to your reports and hearing your plans heading into next quarter. Specifically how we deal with,""

As the boss is speaking one of the other associates takes out a cigarette. When he goes to light it the boss shouts ""Put that thing back where it came from or so help me!"" Jerry bursts into laughter. His superior, noticeably furious, turns to him and says, ""What is so funny!""

Jerry sheepishly replies ""Come on, that one can't be an accident.""

Amid the most awkward pause most of these people had ever experienced a lone cell phone rings. Brent. Dammit new guy. He quickly checks it, says it's an urgent call and steps out. 

The boss trying to regain his composure continues to ramble on about how dire the situation is and how everyone needs to focus on tightening their budgets. After a minute or two Brent returns looking distraught. He manages to blurt out ""That was the hospital.. My wife just died.""

The boss puts a hand on his shoulder saying ""I'm so sorry. If there's anything I can do just know, you got a friend in me.""

Despite his every effort Jerry cant help but let out a single chuckle.

""What, the hell is wrong with you. My dear friend of 20 years just lost the love of his life and you think something's funny? Go ahead. Go ahead and tell me what's so funny about this!""

Jerry, quaking in his boots, stamers for a moment before running out of the room. 


After several agonizing seconds of the door dragging itself shut it finally clicks. Before silence can fill the room the boss exclaims ""Finally! I always hated that fuckin' guy."" The smoker from before hands the boss a cigarette and they light up having a laugh at Jerry. ""Hey, and good thinking new guy, I ws never gonna find a way to work that Toy Story reference in there.""

He ended up playing all eighteen, finishing his round shooting a personal best 61, shattering the club record by five strokes and beating his previous best game by more than 10. He was jubilant.  Then he remembered his wife.

Feeling guilty he dashed to the hospital.  He saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about his wife's condition.

The doctor glared at him and shouted, “You went ahead and finished your round of golf didn't you!"" ""I hope you're proud of yourself!""  ""While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself at the country club your wife has been languishing in the ICU!""

“It's just as well you went ahead and finished that round because it will be more than likely be your last! For the rest of her life she will require round the clock care and you will be her care giver!

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

As they walk in silence, one of them stumbles on a small rock - but when they investigate, they find it is not a rock at all, but an antique oil lamp.

“Maybe there's a genie,” says Donald. The women seem skeptical, but the three of them pry the lamp from the ground, and together, they rub it.

Sure enough, a genie pops out. The mystical creature floats above them, sweet smelling smoke hanging around him as he smiles down upon the three world leaders.

“You have summoned me,” the genie says. “You may have one wish each.”

The Donald does not hesitate. “The American people voted for me to build a wall,” he says, “So, I want you to build a big, beautiful wall around the USA.”

The genie claps his hand, and a mighty thunderclap sounds. “It is done,” he booms.

Theresa May thinks, then says, “The British people voted for Brexit, so we could have control of our borders,” she says. “I'd like a strong and stable wall around the UK.”

Another clap. “It is done.”

Now, Merkel looks thoughtful. “Before I make my wish - can I ask, what are the walls like?”

The genie says, “Each wall is 500 feet tall. They are 50 feet wide. The foundations go down another 200 feet. And nothing can get in or out.”

“Excellent,” Merkel says, a rare grin crossing her face. “Fill them both with water.”",found while browsing Quora,4

“How about this.”
and then he pulled a frog out of his pocket that started to beautifully play the piano.

The barista is amazed and offers him a cup of coffee on the house.
After a while, the hobo finishes his coffee and asks for another.

“No, you pay... 
unless you have another miracle to show us.”

The hobo promptly pulls out a gerbil that begins to sing the current pop song perfectly. Immediately after a man sitting next to him says
“I’ll buy that gerbil for one thousand bucks!”

The hobo agrees and the man leaves with his new pet, much to the dismay of the barista.

“How could you take that deal! That gerbil is worth millions!”

The hobo stops drinking his coffee and says: “you see, the frog is also a ventriloquist.”",A homeless man walks into a cafe and asks for a cup of coffee.,110

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everybody knows Dave,24

Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...

""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.""

The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.

""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.

Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.

""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!""

Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.

Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.

""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.

The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!""

The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.

The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!""

Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.

Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. ""I'VE GOT NOTHING!"" He shouts. ""I GIVE UP!""

The man steps aside.",A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm.,3313
