However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they cannot afford to go a day without it. So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.
Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.
About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!"" Suddenly a lion pounces him from behind and whispers in his ear, ""Shut the fuck up right now or you're going to get us both fired."" ",A gorilla dies (and no its not a harambe joke),94

Their dog thinks i'm a toy. He always grabs a hold of me, and hides me somewhere on the property. In a bedroom, under a couch, under a chair, in a kennel, in the bathroom, somewhere in the backyard, you name it. 

But i'm an old shovel. 25 years for this family. My edges have gone blunt. I'm rusty, and dirty. My handle hurts to hold. The family has bought plenty of other gardening utensils. Axes, pitchforks, shears, you name it.

So a Swedish diver swims to the submarine and knocks on the hatch. Naturally the Norwegian opens the hatch and boom the submarine sinks.

The Norwegian submarine crew gets another submarine as replacement and does the same mission. So of course the Swede swims down to the sub and knocks on the hatch. 
        To the Swedes suprise the same Norwegian opens the hatch so that the submarine sinks once again.

The Norwegian crew gets one more submarine so that they can keep going with the mission. 
The Swede couldn't retain himself so he went down to the sub and knocks on the hatch one more time.
The Norwegian opens the hatch and says:
-Haha I'm not falling for that again!

It was pitch black, so I had the lights on high beam, and I was driving along a country road when all of a sudden my engine cut out. So I pulled over and got out to have a look - sometimes I can fix it myself. It was very dark, and I couldn't get all those horror movies out of my mind, bad things happen on roads at night.

I was looking under the bonnet when I heard a voice, all ethereal and spooky.

""Check your spark plugs""

I looked around and I couldn't see anything so I ignored it and kept checking the engine.

""Check your spark plugs"" came the voice again, and I looked around and couldn't see anyone. So again I ignored it, but I was getting more uncomfortable by the minute.

""Check your spark plugs!"" came the voice louder now, and I turned around to see a white horse looking at me from a field. And lo and behold it opened its mouth and spoke:
""Its your spark plugs, you should check them.""

I was a bit shaken by this but I checked my spark plugs and sure enough, that was the problem. I replaced the broken ones and was on my way - quite glad to be away from that creepy hellhole.

I pulled into a pub a mile up the road, I was really quite shaken by the whole thing. The combination of the darkness and being stuck there was quite scary. The barman asked me if I was feeling alright, I looked a bit pale, so I told him my story about the horse and my car breaking down. Everyone around the pub listened in and when I was finished the barman said:

""Hmm, you're lucky it wasn't the black horse"" awful ominously, to murmurs of agreement from the people around.

""Wh...why's that then?"" I asked. The barman replied.

""He knows fuck all about cars""

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leans out the window and asks the cowboy, 'If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?' 
  The cowboy looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answered, 'Sure, why not?' 
 The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite navigation system to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NAS satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. 
  The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany. Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses a MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer and finally turns to the cowboy and says, 'You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.' 
  'That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,' says the cowboy. 
   He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on amused as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. 
  Then the cowboy says to the young man, 'Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?' 
  The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, 'Okay, why not?' 
  You're a Congressman for the U. S. Government', says the cowboy. 
   'Wow! That's correct,' says the yuppie, 'but how did you guess that?' 
   'No guessing required,' answered the cowboy. 'You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You tried to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about cows. This is a herd of sheep.

That plan obviously goes out the window and after a few too many he ends up throwIng up all down his shirt.

""Shit!"" He says's, ""I promised the wife I wouldn't get hammered tonight. Now she's going to know for sure""

""Don't worry"" says his mate, ""just stick a tenner in your top pocket, and when she finds your shirt in the morning just tell her a drunk guy you bumped into on the way home threw up on you, but he was really aplogetic and stuck a ten pound note in your top pocket to pay to get it cleaned"".

Our protagonist thinks this is a brilliant idea and does as his friend tells him.

Come the morning he's awoken by the sound of his wife...

""Awh Dave! You promised you wouldn't get too drunk last night. You're meant to be looking after the kids today!""

Our bleary eyed reveller remembers the cunnig plan from the night before and explains that a guy threw up on him, and if she looks in the top pocket she'll find the ten quid he gave him to get the shirt cleaned.

The wife reaches into the pocket and pulls out a fist full of cash,

""But there's fifty pounds in here?""

""Oh yeah"" our intrepid hero says, ""he shit in my pants as well"".",Dry cleaning (long),6

""I'll bet you $100 that it's true, come up to the roof with me and I'll show you.""

The second guy, pretty blitzed at this point, figures why not and follows the first guy up the elevator to the roof.

""I'm telling you, it's the way the air currents work,"" the first guy says. ""The strong breeze coming off the lake meets the gusts of wind blowing up here and they keep you afloat!"" He slaps a $100 bill in the second man's hand and states, ""Look, if I'm right then you give me that back along with another $100. If I'm not...well, then I guess you get to keep it anyways.""

The second guy, meanwhile is thinking to himself, ""Man, if this guy is gonna give me $100 and jump off, it's no skin off my back""

The first guy goes up into the ledge, slowly leans over and - sure enough, he's just floating there! He laughs, hovering for a few seconds, and then pulls himself back onto the roof.

The second guy, in complete disbelief, standing there with his jaw wide open, slowly hands $200 over to the first guy. Then a wide grin breaks over his face and he exuberantly yells ""I have GOT to try this!"" 

So the second guy gets up onto the ledge, sloowwwly leans over, and - plummets twenty stories to his death.

The same day he won, Hugh had demanded the monks cease singing, or else he would have to take extreme measures. Finally the monk's chorus stopped, and with it the monastery planned to migrate to a new town.

Awestruck, a police officer that was transferred from a different town's department went to the chief and asked him a question. ""How is it after a year of arguments, the prior mayor didn't stop the monks' songs, yet this mayor stopped it in a day.""

The police chief smiled at the new recruit as he said ""Don't you know? Only Hugh can prevent Chorus Friars.""

You know, I've always heard that you're not supposed to do that, but she had come in from playing outside and was really filthy, so I decided to give her a bath. If you have a cat, don't worry about it. She sat there, she enjoyed it. I found it to be a really nice way to spend some quality time with my furry little friend.

It was fun for both of us.

When I was done her fur was clean and had a brilliant luster. If I had one minor quibble it would be that her fur kept sticking to my tongue, and I coughed up hairballs for three days, but you get used to it.

Give it a try!

A few weeks ago I thought about giving my dog a bath. I know what you're thinking, ""Where am I going to go with this one?""

Well... dogs are dirty animals. They need baths. This is why I think cat's are smarter than dogs. A cat will clean it's entire body, but won't lick its asshole. They know better A dog thinks its ass is a tootsie-roll factory, squeezing out treats on a daily basis. That's why they sniff each other's butts. 
And if that isn't enough, then they want to share it with you, and slather you with butt-kisses. I believe this is really where the term Ass to Mouth got its start. ",I gave my cat a bath the other day,0

He gets even more infuriated this time and blindfolds the cat, drives him further out in the countryside and abandons the cat there. When he gets back home, the bugger is back again, greeting him with a bite.

He goes insane and vows to get rid of the cat forever. He drives for hours and hours on muddy roads through thick jungles and high mountains, the cat blindfolded the whole time. And somewhere in the middle of nowhere at a clearing in the forest, he abandons the cat, sure that he would never set eyes on him again.

One day, the florists went bankrupt and closed down. Then 2 people moved in, fellow fryers, and started stealing Joe's customers.

Joe was outraged, and thus, led him to go talk to the other fryers. They got so mad at Joe they threw him out into the street and he sprained his ankle, so he never bothered them again.

To stop the problem, he tried calling his sister. She was a medic in the military. So she went into the shop but she got thrown into the street, too.

Joe had one last person to call; his brother, Hugh. Hugh was a bouncer for the local night club. So Hugh walks into the store, knocking down tables and crashing salt and pepper shakers and napkin dispensers onto the ground. The two fryers looked at him in fear. The next day, the two fryers packed up and left town.

And thus, our story ends. But you may be wondering what the moral of the story is.

post,6ndlsh,2qh72,jokes,false,1500086431,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6ndlsh/james_from_bulgaria_lived_trains/,self.jokes,,"James from Bulgaria loved trains since he was a boy. He particularly loved how fast they could go. As a child he enjoyed playing with model trains and even owned an old conductors hat that he wore everywhere. 

When he grew up he worked very hard and eventually became a train driver. And he loved it. He finally felt he was where he needed to be. 

One day he was driving his train and he remembered that the speed of the trains was what brought him to the business. And since there was only a few passengers on his morning route, he decided to go above the regulated speed. The train was derailed and crashed in a field. James was fine thankfully but unfortunately one passenger died. 

Now the charge for manslaughter in Bulgaria is execution by electric chair. So James served his time and when we was asked what he would like for his last meal, he said:
""I'd like one banana""
So the guard, slightly baffled, served him a banana and marched him to his death. The executioner flipped the switch and to everyone's surprise, James was fine. 

James said ""I've served my time and faced my execution. So I suppose I should be released."" 

And so he was. But on the outside James had a hard time getting a job until a friend approached him and told him that they were short staffed on train drivers so he could get him a job but he would have to stick to regulation. He agreed, and started driving trains a few days later. And all went well until one day he was running late and a business man who was running late for a meeting began berating James to go faster. And so he went a small bit faster than regulation. 

The train was derailed again and this time two passengers died. James was arrested and when he was asked about his last meal he said:

""I'll have two bananas since I killed two people"" And he ate the two bananas and was marched off once again to the electric chair. 

The executioner flipped the switch and again, James survived. So he was set free.

So James did some soul searching and determined he wasn't fit to drive trains. So he decided that he would be in charge of safety measures and regulations. And after studying for a few years he did just that. 

So on a routine inspection of a train he decided to drive it to know just how safe it was. And he decided that since there was nobody on the train he would push it to it's limits so he could know how to effectively put dampeners on it. So he drives as fast as he can and the train is derailed. But he didn't realise there were three engineers on the train who were all killed. Which inevitably led to his arrest.

So when it came to his last meal, without asking, he was served mushroom soup. The guard said:

""Just eat the soup. Because we don't know how you do it but you're not getting your magical fucking bananas!""

So James ate his soup and was marched to the electric chair. He sat in the chair and the switch was flipped. Miraculously he survived again. 

The executioner, astounded, asked:

""How did you survive without the bananas?""

And James replied:

""It had nothing to do with the bananas. I'm just a bad conductor""",James from Bulgaria lived trains.,8

After a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective professions, ol' St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly station. After passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides to show them to their new lodgings. Only a brief flight from the welcome, Pete brings them down on the front lawn (cloud-encrusted, naturally) of a huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings. This, Pete announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least until the end of time...) 
""Hot Dang"", the Pope says to Him-self, 
- If he's getting a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs! 
They take flight once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear more and more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with brownstone houses.
Pete indicates the third walkup on the left as the Pope's new domicile and turns to leave, wishing the pontiff his best. 
The Pope, in a mild state of astonishment, cries out 
- Hey Pete! What's the deal here? You put that lawyer-feller in a beautiful estate home and I,spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with this dive?
Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replies: 
- Look here old fellow, this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many times and religions. We're putting you here with them so you guys can get your dogma together.

Satan calls out to the trio ""Men, welcome to hell. To atone for your word sins, you will each spend a millennia locked in a room with your vice of voice.""
The men are quickly escorted to their rooms by Satan's henchmen. 
The first man, an alcoholic, arrives at his room. The door is opened by Satan himself and he is pushed into a space a few miles across lined with row after row of only the most premium vodka, rum, whiskey and gin. He is pushed in and the door locked behind him.
The second man, a sex addict, is brought to another room. The door is opened and he is met by  hundreds of the most beautiful women he has ever seen, all immediately willing to jump his bones. He is pushed in and the door shut behind him.
The third man, a pothead and serious burnout, is brought to his room, full of the highest quality bud, piled into a mountain thousands of feet tall and miles across, with rolling papers in mile long rolls along the edge of the room. He is pushed in and the door locked behind them.

Soon enough, a decade, a century, and a millennia pass by and Satan makes his rounds to free the men. He opens the first door to see bottles strewn about and piles of thousand year old vomit everywhere, and a man passed out in his own filth. The man soon awakens, jumps up and yells ""I'm sober, I swear I'm never having a drink again!""

Satan opens the second door, and immediately the man runs out, chased by a flock of horny women screaming ""I'm gay! I'm gay! My dick shrivelled up and fell off three hundred years ago, I swear, I'm gay!""

Satan opens the third door, and is very surprised when the man doesn't come out. He peers in and sees nothing but the intact mount ganja. Satan quickly ascends the mountain of dank and meets the  third man at the summit. 
Satan asks ""you had a whole mountain of the best pot in the universe, why haven't you touched any of it?!""

I looked back at the footprints in the sand.
I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,
especially at the very lowest and saddest times,
there was only one set of footprints.

This really troubled me, so I asked sasquatch about it.
""Sasquatch, you said once I decided to follow you,
You'd walk with me all the way.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Ving is in my math class, and the dude's like a math wiz. I'm really struggling, so I ask Ving if he'd give me a hand on the homework. Ving says yeah, he just wants me to do him a favor. I'm like yeah sure what. He asks me to drive him to the city hall after school. He says he wants to change his name to something more American. 

I'm like cool cool, so after school I'm driving Ling and Ving to the city hall, and Ling is totally giving Ving the cold shoulder. I'm like what's the deal and Ving explains that his name has been passed down for generations, and Ling is totally pissed that he'd disrespect his ancestry by changing it.

So then we get to the city hall and wait in line for a super long time. Finally it's our turn and Ving tells me he's picked ""Lee"" as his American name. He steps up to the desk and starts filling out some paperwork, and the whole time Ling is scolding him about the ancestry shit, blah blah.

Then it's time for Ving to sign his name and seal the deal, but suddenly his eyes well up with tears and he says that he can't do it. Shittttt man, that ancestry shit runs deeeep. The lady at the desk is like ok, but Ving has to pay a small fee to cancel his request. Argh, stupid small town laws. Ling groans as she opens up her purse and starts sifting around for cash. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, some Asian guy bursts through the town hall doors.

""DAD!"" Ling and Ving exclaim. He looked at them and cried,

So, next morning, he gets up bright and early, and heads off to the nearest pet shop, where he enquires about parrots.

They have but one parrot in stock, and it takes one look at the vicar and calls out, ""WANKER! WANKER!""

Not at all appropriate for a church, but no matter. There are other pet shops in town, and the vicar heads off to the next one.

They also have only the one parrot, which takes one look at the vicar and goes ""BOLLOCKS! BOLLOCKS!""

So off to the next pet shop goes the vicar. And the next one, and the next one, because every parrot in every pet shop seems to speak only in profanities.

Finally, almost at closing time, a knackered vicar arrives at the last pet shop in town.

""Do you have any parrots?"" he asks the gentleman behind the counter.

""I believe we do have a parrot, yes,"" says the gentleman.

""Does it have a potty beak?"" asks the vicar.

""Potty beak, vicar?"" says the gentleman.

""Yes, every parrot I've seen today has uttered the most dreadful obscenities,"" says the vicar, ""and I really want a parrot to sit at the church door and greet the congregation, but not with blue language!""

""I think you're in luck, vicar,"" says the pet shop gentleman. ""I think you'll love this parrot!""

The two of them go to the bird section of the pet shop, wherein is perched a very very lovely parrot indeed, with a piece of string attached to each leg.

""Pull the string on its right leg,"" says the pet shop gentleman. The vicar does, and the parrot recites the Lord's Prayer.  The vicar is delighted.

""Now pull the string on its left leg,"" says the gentleman. The vicar does, and the parrot sings the hymn ""Abide With Me"", not perfectly in tune, but it doesn't matter because it's SO CUTE!

The vicar is overjoyed, and gets his wallet out to buy the parrot, and asks, ""so, what happens if I pull both strings at the same time?""

The parrot looks at him and says, ""I fall off my fucking perch, you stupid cunt!""","One evening, a vicar has a brilliant idea.",103

""Look at the state of you, you've got sick all down your shirt.""

""Now honey, listen, this isn't mine. Some guy was drunk and threw up on me. He even put $10 in my pocket to apologise.""

He has no body parts except his head. The bartender looks at him and says ""I have this magical beer that can grant you a wish for every sip!""

The man takes a minute to think. And decides to ask his friend to buy him a bottle of this magical beer. His friend agrees to do so and then gives him a drink. The man makes his first wish:

""I wish for a torso."" And a torso slowly grows, being the perfect shape for his size of head. He looks at his friend and says, ""Quick! Give me another sip!""

His friend gives him another sip and he makes another wish. ""I wish for a arm on either side!""

Two arms slowly grow out of the mans new torso. And he uses these arms to take another sip. And he continues taking sips and making wishes until he has every body part he knows of. He quickly realizes he's naked though, and runs home with the beer.

At first, his life is great. He is always on top of bills, often times he is able to pay three times the price of them. He develops a family, and two years later his wife and he get into an arguement over bills that they've fallen behind. He was about to win the arguement and then he remembers the beer and quickly runs to the fridge. 

""It's still here!"" He exclaims. As the magical beer is in his fridge with only a sip left.

His wife yells at him, ""How will a drink help us now?""

He responds, ""You want to be ahead of these bills, honey? Watch."" He takes a sip and makes his final wish:

""I wish to be what I was two years ago!"" He quickly loses his limbs, torso, and even his neck. 

He realizes his mistake and mutters, ""I meant my financial position.""

His wife gives a snicker and says, ""You should've quit while you were ahead.""

One day the child's lips start moving and starts mumbling. Everyone one runs to hear the first words of the child. ""Grandma"", the child says and everyone is happy again that at last the child can speak. However the next day sorrow engulfs the household as they discover Grandma dead in her room. 

Almost immediately the child starts mumbling again and this time says ""Uncle"". Again the next day they find the uncle dead in his room. Everyone is now fearful of the child, who begins to mumble. The entire household races for the door but not before the child pronounces ""Dada"".

Morning comes, lo and behold the father steps out of his room hale and hearty. This time everyone is relieved, the child is not prescient after all.

Al-Gebra is a problem for us', the Attorney General said. 'They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.' They use secret code names like ""X"" and ""Y"" and refer to themselves as ""unknowns"" but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philosopher Isosceles used to say, ""There are 3 sides to every triangle.""
