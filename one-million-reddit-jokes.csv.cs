God: Wisest soul, youngest heart. Did you foresee this ending?

Devil: Oldest soul, smartest spirit. I can honestly say I did not. You tempted them to the path of love and I, the path of evil. I honestly thought one of us would win. How did we both end up losing?

God: The numbers were horrifying. After seeing all those zeroes I was absolutely certain that Hell would over power Heaven by getting everyone addicted, but, during the final days of the end of evolution it became clear that things would be decided by the last vote. The legendary words uttered by the biblical atheist brought doom upon us just as nature prophesied.

Devil: Say old friend, could you say his words for me in your voice. I want to hear it from you. I'll let you have a date with Hell herself for entertaining me.

God: I would rather you sing me a song.

Devil: Done.

After taking a moment to contain his hysterical laughter that would have taken him exactly one eternity to calm down, God looked Devil in the eyes and spoke the words of the last human who was given the choice every human before him was offered: 'Eternal grace or endless style'. God spoke in his voice of endless harmony.

God: ""So, you're asking me if I want to be Ultra Holy Saint or a Psychosociopath. Would a lion eat grass? It would not. Would a deer eat meat? It would not. There is absolutely one thing a human cannot do. A human cannot accept defeat. This is clearly a game between two. Neither of these options have humanity in them. I forfeit my vote.""

Devil stopped his heart for a moment before having an epiphany. 

Devil: I just thought of a joke.

God: Pray, do tell.

Devil: Man asked woman: ""What am I without you?""

She said: ""A cigarette without a lighter to light it.""

He laughed and asked: ""Then tell me what are you without me?""

She said: ""A lighter that has nothing to burn.""

God: That was a terrible joke, dear friend.

Devil: You didn't get it.

God: Pray, do explain.

Devil: A cigarette can be lit by a match stick and the purpose of a lighter is not burning things. Its purpose is to create a flame.

God: The point?

The hiring manager was not happy.  ""Look, I know it's your first day in sales, so I'll forgive it this time.  But you gotta sell more than one if you want to keep your job.""

The next day the man went to another neighborhood.  When he returned to the office at the end of the day he said, ""I sold two toothbrushes today!""

Now the hiring manager was furious.  ""That's not nearly enough!  You have one more day to get this right.  If you don't sell a lot more tomorrow, you're fired.""

When the man came back to the office at the end of the next day, again he was asked how he did.  ""I sold 1500 toothbrushes!"" he proclaimed.

""Oh my god!"" said the hiring manager.  ""That's incredible.  It's more than anyone has ever sold in one day before.  How did you do it?""

""Well,"" he began, ""I went to a grocery store and set up a table outside with some chips and some dip.  And I asked people to try them.  They would taste it and say, 'This dip tastes like shit!'  And I would say, 'It is!  Would you like to buy a toothbrush?""",A man was down on his luck and in desperate need of a job.,5

He turns back annoyed and sees that the hand belongs to an old bearded overweight guy.

""Why did you stop me you old fool?""

""Have you gone mad my son? You were about to kill yourself!"" The old man exclaims with a booming voice.

""I have nothing to live for anymore! Just let me end it!""

""Listen my son. I'm Santa Claus and I'm just here on vacation. But if you'd like, tell me what the problem is and maybe we can fix it."" Said the old man with genuine concern.

""OK Santa, I'll tell you"" the businessman shrugged ""I used to be a really successful businessman. I had it all, amazing cars, beautiful women, loads of money. But now I lost it all thanks to the stock market crash. So I have nothing to live for.""

""That's what got you in such melancholy? My boy, my boy! Tomorrow morning at 10, come here on this bridge and there will be a brand new Lamborghini waiting just for you!""

The businessman is surprised, then ecstatic. He grabs Santa and kisses him on both cheeks and then starts crying with joy. They sit down and talk for a while. But when they start discussing women, the businessman is depressed again.

""Oh Santa, I used to be such a playboy. Every single night I would bring home at least 2 different stunning and beautiful girls. Now, and at my age, I'll be lucky to find a mediocre girlfriend.""

""That's what got you worried? Don't pout my son. In the Lamborghini tomorrow there will be 4 beautiful women waiting for you. They are all yours!""

The man starts hugging Santa again and says

""I'm sorry Santa, maybe it's too much, but since you are doing all this for me, could you give me back at least part of my wealth? I wasn't a greedy asshole like the rest of them. I used to spend it left and right and give to charities. I just enjoyed making people happy, and I'd like that back again.""

""Sure my boy. One of the women tomorrow will have a suitcase with 1 billion dollars in it. It's all yours!""

""Oh thank you Santa, thank you so much. How could I ever repay you?""

""Well, there's one thing... I kinda miss my wife who had to stay at the North Pole, and especially... well this is embarassing... her blowjobs that she gave me every night. Would you give me a blowjob?""

The businessman is dumbfounded at first, but quickly steels himself

""Santa, you didn't just save my life, you gave it back to me as well. What you ask is the least I can do and I will gladly do it!""

""Brilliant my boy. My hotel isn't far from here. Follow me.""

Santa leads the businessman to a hotel a couple blocks away. They go into Santa's bedroom and the businessman drops to his knees, unbuckles Santa's pants and goes to work. After they finish up, the business man goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Santa leans at the door and asks:

""My boy, you never told me your name""

""I'm Alex, Santa""

""Nice to meet you Alex. Tell me, how old are you?""

""I'm nearly 50, Santa""

""And in these 50 years of life, did it never occur to you Alex, that Santa Claus might not be real?""","An ex-businessman, now bankrupt, is preparing to jump off a bridge...",7

He had hours left to get to the airport, and he was lucky that his ticket was at the side compartment of his luggage. He walked up to the street to the single standing taxi he could find. He approached the car and then knocked at the window. 

The cab driver rolled down his windows and asked: ""Let me guess, airport? Makes 60 dollars.""

The business man replied: ""I have no cash with me, I was robbed. No cash, no credit cards, but I've got my ticket with me.""

With shaking head the driver huffs: ""No cash, no business with me.""

Desperated, the business man pleas for good faith in the driver: ""Please, you gotta help me, I've got 4 hours left, and I promise to pay you. I will double the fare. And add 100 dollars on top! I'm pleading with you, please take me to the airport!""

The driver lets his offer sink in for a minute, then says: ""Your offer stinks. I don't want to trust you. Take a bus or something."" and drove off, leaving the business man behind. 

However, the business man was lucky and able to catch his flight, even though he made it in last minute. 

A year later again the business man has a trip in Las Vegas. Upon finishing his trip, he checks out of the hotel and walks to a taxi stand, where all taxis are lined one after the another. Near the rear end the business man recognizes the taxi driver who had left him alone in times of dire need. 

The business man then goes to the front end pf the parked row and asked the cab driver: ""How much is it to the airport?""

Driver: ""60 dollars!""

Man: ""And how much do you take for a blow job?""

Driver: ""Fuck off!"" and rolled up his window 

The business man goes to the next driver behind and asks the same questions, only to get told to ""fuck off"" every time. He repeats it with every other vab driver, until he approaches the last year's cab driver. While approaching, the driver doesn't recognize the business man from last year.

The business man knocked at the window and the cab driver rolled down the window and asked: ""Let me guess, airport? Makes 60 dollars!"".

The business man answered: ""That's a nice offer! I'll take that!"" and gets in.

The American man agrees orders something small to ensure he can eat the bulls testicles and come back the next day.

The next day he walks up the restaurant and before even sat orders the testicles and sits down. After about 20 minutes the waiter walks up with 2 small round pieces of meat garnished and covered in tomato sauce and sets the plate down in front of the American.

""Well, it's quite simple, really,"" says the seller, ""whenever the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain."" Saying so, he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I have to tell you something about my family before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.""

""No problem,"" he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation and leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word. So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her right there, in front of her parents. His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. ""She's got a great body,"" he thinks. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her in every position right there on the dinner table. Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain. Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, ""All right, that's enough, I'll do the fucking dishes.""","Joe wanted to buy a motorbike.

On his way to the town, the preacher noticed his horse begin to walk oddly to and fro, unable to keep a straight line.  It dawned on him that the herb must have been the Peyote he had heard rumor about.

When he finally arrived in town, before even setting foot on the ground, he began telling people their sinful ways and of the pit that awaited them if they did not seek repentance and redemption.  He amassed a small following of faithful.

An hour or so later, one of his followers found him on the ground sucking his horse's penis.  ""Preacher!  What are you doing?"" the young woman cried out.

Billy gets home and his mom says “Billy, I wasn’t expecting you for another 2 hours! What are you doing here?” And billy says “Well earlier I heard some 7th graders talking about purple passion, so I asked the math teacher what it meant and she sent me to the principals office. I asked the principal and he expelled me.” Billy’s mom says “billy, go to your room. we will discuss this later.” So billy waits for hours and hours until his dad gets home and his dad says “Billy, what’d you do to make your mother so angry?” Billy says “I really think you don’t want to know.” Well, his dad says “Billy, please.

I heard it earlier today from some 7th graders, I asked my teacher what it meant and she sent me to the principals office. The principal expelled me, so I asked my mom and she sent me to my room so I asked my dad and he kicked me out and then I went to my grandfathers house and he had a heart attack.” The cop says “ I’m taking you down town billy.” So billy ends up in the courthouse and the judge says “ why’d you bring this kid into my court room?

semester, having foolishly squandered all of his money on his girlfriend, he calls home.

""Dad,"" he says, ""You won't believe what modern education is developing! They actually have a program here at Hendrix that will teach our dog, Ole' Blue how to talk!""

""That's amazing,"" his Dad says. ""How do I get Ole' Blue in that program?""

""Just send him over here with $1,000"" the young Arkie says ""and I'll get him in the course.""

So, his Father sends the dog and $1,000.

About two-thirds of the way through the semester, the money again runs out. The boy calls home.

""So how's Ole' Blue doing son?"" his Father asks.

""Awesome, Dad, he's talking up a storm,"" he says, ""but you just won't
&gt;believe this -- they've had such good results they have started to teach the animals how to read!""

""Read!?"" says his Father, ""No kidding! How do we get Blue in that program?""

""Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class.""

The money promptly arrives. The Arkie and his girlfriend are able to buy enough marijuana to last the whole semester. But our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his Father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. Even though he was always pretty much able to lie his way out of trouble, the Arkie asked his girlfriend to help him think of a
really good lie to tell his Dad. She very quickly came up with a plan for him.

So she has him shoot the dog.

When he arrives home at the end of the year, his Father is all excited.

""Where's Ole' Blue? I just can't wait to see him read something and talk!""

""Dad,"" the boy says, ""I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Ole' Blue was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading the Wall Street Journal, like he usually does"".

""Then Ole' Blue turned to me and asked, so, is your Daddy still messing around with that little redhead who lives down the street?""

The Father went white and exclaimed, ""I hope you shot that lying damn dog before he talks to your Mother!""

""I sure did, Dad!""

""That's my boy!""

super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as ""Area 51?"" 

Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. 
The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. 
By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. 
They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying 
""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. 

The day after that though, to the total disbelief ofthe Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane... Only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I 
was last night!""

There he meets Satan. “What are you doing down here? I see you lived a pretty decent life.”

“I went to Heaven first and they aren’t admitting anyone right now. I don’t really have anywhere else to go.”

“Hmm, I guess I could let you stay here. But what can you do for me? I see you made some pretty incredible things when you were alive.”

“I think I can make some improvements in exchange for somewhere to spend eternity, what do you think?” 

“It’s a deal!” says Satan, and he lets the engineer in to Hell.

post,czy2ly,2qh72,jokes,false,1567672611,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/czy2ly/a_television_network_recently_launched_a_new_game/,self.jokes,,"In the show, the host will read jokes to the player, and the player must guess the punchline before the host reaches it. If the player successfully “crack the joke”, he can then choose to either take whatever he already won and leave, or proceed to the next joke. There are 10 jokes to be cracked for each player, and the grand prize is $30,000 for who cracks them all.

3 players were invited to the very first episode of the show. With a big round of applause came the first player, a fabulous looking elderly lady. The host asked her to introduce herself, so she did: “Hello everyone, my name is Lucy and I’m from Sydney. I’m 74 years old. I have a bunch of cheerful friends who loves telling each other jokes. I have heard quite a lot during my 60 years friendship with them, and that would help me with today’s challenge.” The host wished her luck and started reading. 

Lucy certainly wasn’t unfamiliar with the jokes, but her age was dragging her down. She eventually failed to crack the 4th joke despite of it being “so familiar, I’ve definitely heard this one somewhere”. The host regretfully announced her defeat.

The second player was a sharp looking man with a business suit. He introduced himself without the host have to ask: “Morning lovely people. My name is Bob Jassen. I’m a car salesman. I like talking to my customers, and I use jokes as ice breakers. I collect jokes whenever I see them so I never run out of material.” The host wished him luck and started reading.

Bob has an excellent mind and knows many jokes. Without too much trouble he was already at his 6th joke. But he hadn’t heard this one before. He took a wild guess and got lucky. He decided to take the safer route, so he grabbed his $2,500 prize money and left.

And from the backstage came the last player of the night. He was an average looking man with t-shirt, jeans and a pair of glasses. He was sitting there, visibly nervous, when the host asked him to do the introduction. He said: “Hi, I’m u/jimraynor0. I’m a programmer.” The host had to ask: ”A programmer eh? And what makes you think you’re good at cracking jokes?” To which Jim replied: “I read r/jokes almost everyday.” 

The host thought Jim was not very interesting. Without further conversation he started the game: “A lumberjack went into a magic forest to cut...”

Jim interrupted him mid-sentence and answered correctly: ”And you’ll dialogue.”

The host confirmed that Jim wish to continue, then proceed to read the 2nd joke: “A couple went to a sex therapist’s clinic. The doctor asked: ‘what can I help you with?’ And the man asked: ‘can you watch us having sex?’”

And it was then Jim interrupted again: “you only charge $50 if we do it here, and we get $43 back from Medicare.” Once again he was correct.

The game continues. “A young kid goes to a big department store looking for a job. The manager asked: ‘Do you have any sales experience?’”

“Your weekend is ruined, you might as well go fishing.” Said Jim.

“A man got on a bus and sat next to a beautiful nun...”

“I’m the bus driver.”

“An 18 years old Italian girl...”

“You fuck her again.”

“Dave bragged...”

“Who’s the guy standing next to Dave at the balcony?”

Jim seemed unstoppable. As he cracked more jokes he picked up confidence as well, answering even before the host can finish the first sentence. Not long had passed before he got to his last joke. The host looked at his hand, there’s only one joke card left. It was a pun, and it seems quite obvious. “Well, nothing can stop him now.” The host thought to himself, and proceed to read the joke: “Have you heard that the police stormed a touring circus and found the secret stash of their scamming magician?”

He was expected to be interrupted again, but no. This time Jim just sat in silence, with a face of agony and frustration. The host, still in total disbelief, finished the joke: “It was intense.” And with that he claimed Jim failed to crack the joke and earned nothing.

Before Jim could go, the host asked him: “How did you missed the last joke? It wasn’t even a clever pun.” With a defeated look on his face, Jim said: “You see, your joke is a regional con tent. That’s sth I never see on r/jokes.”",A television network recently launched a new game show called “crack the joke”,16

God explained, pointing to different parts of earth. 'For example, northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while southern Europe is going to be poor. Over here I've placed a continent of white people, and over there is a continent of black people. Balance in all things.'
God continued pointing to different countries. 'This one will be extremely hot, while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.'

One day during an argument, his wife has had it with his coughing and hacking and tells him ""Im making a bet, if this damn coughin kills you i'm writing ' I told you so' on your tombstone!""

The doctor said that masturbating before sex often helps men last longer. The man decided, “What the hell, I’ll try it.”

He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn’t do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.

Suddenly, George had a flash of inspiration, and he realized what he should do.

On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck’s undercarriage.

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.

Thinking that the car’s undercarriage was a bit of a turn-off, he firmly closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, “What?”

He heard, “This is the police. What’s going on down there?”

The man replied, “I’m checking out the rear axle, it’s busted.”

Then he heard the reply, “Well, you might as well check your brakes too, because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”

'Can I have a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie?'

The barman is amazed, but gives the rabbit a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie.

The rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie. He then leaves.

The following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie.

The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the Toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed.

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The next night there is standing room only in the pub.

Coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending.

The barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The barman says, 'I'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker, but we are right out of them Ham and Cheese Toasties.'

The rabbit looks aghast.

The crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says,
'We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.

The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will like it.'

The crowd's bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.

The barman, with a roguish smile says, 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends. I know you'll love it.'

'Ok,' says the rabbit, 'I'll have a pint of beer and a Cheese and Onion Toastie.'

The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie.

He then waves to the crowd and leaves....

NEVER TO RETURN!!!!!!

One year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time.

When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

The barman says, 'Who are you?

To which he is answered,
'I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.'

The barman says, 'I remember you. You made me famous.

You would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. Masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

The rabbit says, 'Yes I know.'

The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't have any Ham and Cheese Toasties. You had a Cheese and Onion one instead.'

The rabbit said, 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it.'

The barman said, 'You never came back, what happened?'

'I DIED', said the rabbit.

'NO!' said the barman. 'What from?'

So, how are you getting there?""

""We're flying on Continental,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""

""Continental?"" exclaimed the hairdresser. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late.

So, where are you staying in Rome?""

""We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's left side called Teste.....""

""Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks its gonna be something special and exclusive. But it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the whole city! The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're way overpriced.

So, whatcha doing when you get there?""

""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""

""That's rich,"" laughed the hairdresser. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're sure going to need it.""

A month later, the woman, all smiling, came in for her hair appointment. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome.

""It was absolutely wonderful,"" explained the woman, ""not only did we arrive on time in one of Continental's brand new jets, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot.

And the hotel -- it was fabulous! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's just a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!""

""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""I know you didn't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me."" Sure enough, five minutes later, the Holy Father walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.""

""Really?"" asked the hairdresser. ""What'd he say?""
