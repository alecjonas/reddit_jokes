The parrot was fully grown with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary.  Every other word was an obscenity.  Those that weren’t expletives, were to say the least, rude.  David tried hard to change the bird’s attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could think of. Nothing worked.  He yelled at the bird and the bird yelled back.  He shocked the bird and the bird just got more angry and more rude.  Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the bird in the freezer, just for a few moments.  He heard the bird squawk and kick and scream-then suddenly, there was quiet. David was frightened that he might have hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.  The parrot calmly stepped out and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’ll endeavor at once to correct my behavior. I really am truly sorry and beg your forgiveness.”  David was astonished at the bird’s change in attitude and was about to ask what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot continued, “May I ask what did the chicken do?”",Bad parrot,27

Wife: ""I want to learn and besides it's something we can do together.""

The husband begrudgingly accepts his wife request and they go to the golf course. On the first tee the husband drives it 300 yards, dead center. The wife tries it and slices it right into a huge window of a huge house on the side of the course.

Husband says ""ah shit. Ok let's go pay for this window

The couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. A very well dressed man answers the door, ""Can I help you?""

Husband: ""Hi we're the ones that broke the window, are you the owner of the house?""

Well dressed man: ""oh no I am only the butler. Master is in the other room, follow me.

Husband: ""oh I am so sorry. My wife, you see, is learning golf. She didn't mean to..""

The master interrupts in an understanding tone ""haha oh its alright. You see I'm a genie and I was trapped in that vase for the last several hundred years. But you released me by breaking it. As you know genies grant 3 wishes. But since you did break the window I will save the third for myself, leave 1 each for you both. Madame would you like to go first?""

Wife: ""oh my goodness thank you so much!""

""You're turn"", says the the master looking at the husband.

Husband: ""I'd like a beautiful home in ever country.""

Master: ""and you shall have it. Complete with protection from all the elements and a staff to maintain it and look after you when you stay.""

Husband: "" Jesus! thank you so much!""

Master: ""not a problem. As for my wish, well I have been trapped in that vase for so long and all the while without a woman. I am sorry but my wish is to have sex with your beautiful wife.""

Husband to wife: ""I don't know honey. I mean he did give us all of those houses and an unlimited amount of money. You know how I feel about cheating but this seems different.""

Wife: ""yeah I agree. I'm not thrilled about it but I get where he is coming from. Okay I'll do it""

The Master is thrilled and wisks the wife upstairs where they have loud, wall banging sex for hours on end. Finally after all that time the master comes down in only his underwear and his unbuttoned dress shirt. He grabs a cup of water and drinks the whole thing. The master then asks the nearby husband, "" if you don't mind me asking how old are you and your wife?""

Our tiger now circled her sniffing the air and suddenly bounded to her, put its face between her legs and started licking. She threw back her head moaning, holding the tiger by the ears.

""Now, would you please tell me what the third word of the First Amendment is?""

The voter thinks a bit, then replies with ""make"". The official digs out his copy of the Bill of Rights then verifies this.

""Now, can ya tell me who wrote the *Art of War*?""

The voter wonders what this has to do with voting, but answers ""Sun Tsu"".

The official, who is now a bit worried, fetches his supervisor. The supervisor comes out, assesses the situation, then asks the voter, 

""This is the final literacy test. Could you interpret and recite the first two Dead Sea Scrolls?""

The voter hesitates for a bit but recites the first one flawlessly. On the second one, he stumbled on a word.

""Aha!"" exclaimed the official, ""you've *failed* the lit'racy test! Bett'r luck next year!""

The black voter, defeated, walks out the door. Another voter, a white one approaches.

""Can ya pay the poll tax? It's five dollas.""

""Ah shit, I left my wallet at home.""

""Alwrite. That's okay. You gotta also pass the lit'racy test. Can ya spell 'cat'?""

""K-A-T?""

""Eh, close enough.""",Literasee test,0

A father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!",A father passing by his son's bedroom was atonished to see,12

Check-in took forever because the baggage carousels weren't working. Then I got pulled aside at security because I'd forgotten about a pack of jelly beans in my back pocket. That meant I was rushing to the gate and in my haste I lost the book is massively overpaid for. 

The take off was delayed four hours but we had to stay on the plane because the doors had already closed. No air conditioning and the guy next to me had a bad BO problem. When it finally took off the woman in front of me reclined her chair into my knees and the kid behind decided the tray table was a punching bag so my seat was wobbling about which made me travel sick. However, it was BO boy that threw up. Thankfully he got most of it in the bag and only a tiny splash on my shoes. 

We hit turbulence just after the hour mark then a severe hail storm knocked out one engine. As we were over the sea the pilot told us we were diverting to make an emergency landing but halfway down there was a horrible shudder then people on the left hand side of the plane started screaming that the engine was on fire. I only found out afterwards that it was due to an airstrike with a flock of geese - at the time I was too busy admiring my puke stained shoes from the brace position as the pilot performed a miracle to actually get us down in one piece. The water landing was juddery and gave me whiplash.

In the back,the owner grabs an old dusty box from the top of a wooden shelf, blows all the dust off and opens it up. There was a dildo.

“A dildo? You brought me here for a dildo?” Said the man

“Sir, this isn’t just *any* dildo, this here is a voodoo dildo. 

“A voodoo dildo?”

“Yep, watch this....voodoo dildo, door”

Right away the dildo hovers a foot into the air and begins fucking the door. 

“HOLY SHIT” the man screams, that’s incredible!

The owner says the magic word and the dildo falls to the ground immediately. Extremely impressed the man buys it for his wife. 

Later that night he left the present and a note and left town for work.

In the morning, after reading the instructions, the woman decides to use it on her way to work. Wow, did she ever enjoy it, eventually getting pulled over by a policeman. 

“Ma’am I pulled you over because you’re driving carelessly, you’re all over the place, have you been drinking?”

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.  


I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.  


But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.  


Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.  


In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!  


Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.  


Love, your son, Joshua.

The ME starts by cutting the man wide open and begins to remove his organs, handing them to the ex-carpenter to bag and label: heart, liver, lungs, stomach, intestines, kidneys, everything. By this point the ex-carpenter is flecked with blood and viscera and looks pale and sickly.

Eventually, the ME comes to the brain. He pulls out a bone-saw the length of his arm and begins unceremoniously hacking away at the man’s skull, chunks of flesh and bone fly wild and by this point the ex-carpenter is covered in blood.

The ME is having real trouble with the skull, he’s been sawing for minutes now and the ex-carpenter is physically shaking, the blood vessels popping in his neck and forehead, his knuckles clenched white.

Finally he lets out a scream and wrestles the saw from the ME’s hands, but before the detectives can congratulate each other the ex-carpenter takes the saw to the man’s skull and bellows:

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!"".

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

Confident that his business would be a success, the man took the deal and began building his network. About a year later, once his work was complete he named his network “Zero”, to represent the amount of bias that would exist in his news. 
He soon found out that people didn’t have time for news which didn’t conform to their views, and so his business went under. As per his deals, he took the materials back to where the came from, making sure that not even a brick was out of place.

The receptionist gave him some promotion pack options of “lose 1kg guaranteed”, “lose 3 kg guaranteed”, “lose 5kg guaranteed” and “lose 10kg guaranteed”. However you must do 1 then 3 then 5 then 10.

He accepted the offer and the receptionist told him to wait at home.

The next day, the doorbell rang. Frank opened the door to a hot girl standing with a sign around her neck saying “catch me and I’m yours”. The girl took off and Frank went running after her for 10km.

Unable to catch, he went back home. After the exhaustion wore off, he found that he lost 1 kg. Delighted, he immediately went back to the gym and signed up for the 3kg package.

The next day, the doorbell rang again. Frank opened the door to an even hotter girl, shirtless with the same sign. Again, she took off and he ran after her. This time for 20km.

Frank was again unable to catch. So he went home disappointed, until he found that he lost 3kg. So again, he went back to the gym for round 3, 5kg.

The next day, the doorbell rang. It was an even hotter girl, only wearing bra, thongs and running shoes with a sign, “catch me and I’m yours”. He chased her until sunset, nearly catching her. 

He went home excited. Finding himself loosing 5kg, and that he’d catch the next one, maybe a completely naked hot women. He went to the gym for the 10kg package. 

He turned around to find a buffed bodybuilder with a sign around his neck.

“Catch you, and you’re mine”

So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""","One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.",96

Everyone pitched in, and the project was underway. 

Nine of the disciples were chosen as the ""roadie"" crew, and were sent on ahead to the site. Their tasks were to set up the stage, procure the theater-type seating, and design and install lighting and sound systems. 

Thomas, Peter, and Judas stayed to help Jesus make arrangements for the food required to feed such a large a group. First of all, they had to determine how many loaves, fishes, and bottles of water it would be needed. So, the four of them sat down to discuss it. 

Peter spoke first, ""Since we'll be feeding five times as many people this time, I think we should plan to have five of each of the food and drink items. Now, I can't deny that this will make it hard to stay within our budget. But there isn't much choice, in my opinion."" 

Thomas added, ""I agree with Peter. I have my doubts that only one of each is enough, as making do with only that will put a major strain on the power of miracles."" 

Judas remarked, saying, ""I disagree with both of my colleagues. But, Peter is right about the budget issue. We have only 30 pieces of silver to spend - that's not nearly enough for five of everything. Jesus, I think that we have to rely on you for a much stronger miracle this time."" 

All were silent for a few moments as the three disciples waited to hear what Jesus had to say. Finally Jesus spoke, ""As I see it, the deal breaker is a budgetary issue. I'll have to seriously ramp up my miracle making skills. Let's go with one each, like before. And, if we don't have enough for everybody . . . well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.” 

It was agreed. They started their journey to the Sea of Galilee, having decided to purchase the food at a local market when they arrived. 

They made their purchases, then made their way to the Hilton, where they were staying. Early the next morning they prepared to leave for the event location. Jesus was stressed about the huge miracle he had to pull off later in the day. He knew that if the food was at maximum freshness, he could whip up an outstanding miracle. So he instructed that the food items be wrapped and carried a specific way. 

To Peter, he said,""Wrap the bread loaf tightly in some parchment, then put it in a clean linen bag. When carrying it, keep the top of the bag tightly folded."" 

Thomas got his instructions next. ""Wrap the fish loosely in parchment heavily soaked in olive oil. Put it into a small woven basket for carrying.” 

Then he nodded to Judas and said, ""You can bring the water. It's already protected in that clay jug. So, all you have to do, Judas, Iscariot.""","His disciples had persuaded Jesus to have another, bigger Loaves and Fishes gathering at the Sea of Galilee.",2

“'Tis done,” says the wizard. “And what about you, Rabbit?”

The rabbit thinks long and hard about his wish, bit eventually he says he would like a motorcycle. Suddenly, a brand new motorcycle appears out of  nowhere right in front of him. The bear is quite confused about the rabbit's choice, but he continues on to his second wish.

The bear considers his second wish and says, “I wish all the bears in all the neighbouring forests were female!” and, the wizard assures him that it has been done.

Again, the rabbit thinks long and hard about his wish, but in the end he decides on fuel for his motorbike. The bear is even more nuzzled about the rabbit's choice and concludes that he must just be a complete idiot like he'd always thought, but he continues on to his third and final wish.

The bear considers his last wish for a while longer, but eventually he decides. “I wish that every other bear in the world was female!”

“It is done,” replies the genie. “And what about you, rabbit?”

Now, Rick loved to ride his motorcycle, but was tired of driving up and down the same roads, day after day.

One morning, he woke up, and decided to travel the world. So he saved up some money, got on a plane, along with his trusty Harley, and set out to explore the globe.

For the next few weeks, Rick spent his days riding to and through some of the most popular European cities like Paris, London, and Rome.

After seeing all Europe had to offer, he moved on to explore the rest of the world. Over the next few months, he rode through the African savannas, the deserts of Egypt, and even made it to the top of Mount Everest.

He was having the time of his life until he reached a small town in China. Unexpectedly, and out of nowhere, a beautiful Chinese maiden crossed his path, causing him to fly off and crash his motorcycle. Apologizing, the maiden offered Rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike. “My name is Yu! It’s an honor to meet you!” the beautiful maiden introduced herself to Rick.

It turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. However, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, Rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of Yu. Over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange American ways. As expected, Rick took a liking to her, too.

The two quickly became inseparable, but Yu’s father did not approve, for Rick was an outsider. By the time the motorcycle was finally up and running, Rick had fallen madly in love with Yu and refused to leave. Yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the Magistrate had Rick banished from the town. He warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.

Rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey. It seemed as though there was nothing left for him in the world, if he didn’t have his beloved Chinese maiden.

So he did the only thing any other sane guy would do….

Rick rolled back into town screaming,

Micro was a real time user and a dedicated multi-user. His broad-band protocol made it easy for him to interface with numerous input/output devices, even if it meant time sharing. 

One evening Micro arrived home just as the sun was crashing. He had parked his Motorola 68000 in the main drive - he had missed the 5100 bus that moring, when he noticed an elegant piece of liveware inspecting the daisy wheels in his garden. ""She looks user-friendly,"" he thought. ""I'll see if she'd like an update tonight."" Mini was her name and she was delightfully engineered with eyes like cobol and a prime mainframe architecture that set Micro's peripherals networking all over the place. He shifted over to her casually, admiring the power of her twin 32-bit floating point processors and inquired, 

“How are you, Honeywell?"" 

“Yes, I am well,"" she responded, batting her optic fibers engagingly and smoothing her console over her curvilinear functions. Micro
thought about a recursive approach but settled for a straight line approximation. 

“I'm stand-alone tonight,"" he said. ""How about computing a vector to my base address? I'll output a byte to eat and maybe we could get
offset later on."" 

Mini ran a priority process for 2.6 milliseconds then dumped the results. ""I've been put on a queue myself recently and a rendezvous is just what I need to activate my tasks. I'll park my machine cycle and meet you inside."" She walked off leaving Micro admiring the way
her dynamic resources were allocated and thinking, ""Wow, what a cache! I wonder if she's available for prime time maintenance."" They sat down at the process table to a platter of fiche and chips and a basket of baudot. Mini was in conversational mode and expanded on ambiguous arguments while Micro gave continuous acknowledgements although, in background, he was analyzing the shortest and least critical path to her entry point. He finally decided on the old 'Would you like to see some of my benchmark programs' but Mini anticipated his flow. Without a prompt, she was up and stripping off her parity bits to reveal the full functionality of her operating system
software. 

“Let’s get BASIC, you RAM,"" she commanded. Micro was executing firmware by this stage, but his hardware policing module had an accelerated processor and was in danger of overflowing its output buffer - a bug that
Micro had been consulting his analyst about. 

""Core dump!"" he complained. Micro auto-recovered however, when Mini went down on DEC and opened her divide files to reveal her data set ready. He accessed his fully packed root device and was just about to enter her kernel when she attempted an escape sequence. ""Abort!"" she cried. ""You're not shielded."" 

“Reset, baby,"" he said. “I've been debugged."" 

“But I haven't got my current loop disabled and I can't support child processes,"" she protested. 

“Don't run away,"" he begged.

""I'll generate an interrupt."" 

“No, that's too error prone - and I can't abort because of my design philosophy."" 

Micro was in phase locked oscillations by this stage and could not be terminated. But Mini soon stopped his thrashing by inducing a voltage spike in his main supply, whereupon he fell over with a head crash and went to sleep. ""Computers!"" she thought as she compiled herself. ""All they ever think about is hex!",A love story - bit by bit,1

Part 1, of which most people have heard some variation

\---------------

A man named Joseph decided to become a monk. Eventually he committed fully and went to monk school, where his classmates shorten his name to Joe. Then he went to monk graduate school were he got a degree on monkology and after he flew to Europe where there are plenty of monk jobs. He took the bus to Monk Mountain, where he had signed up for a one year monk internship. He climbed and he climbed, and after many hours he reached a gated monastery at the top. He knocked on the iron bars and was greeted by man in his mid thirties, wearing simple brown robes.

""Hello there, I'm the new monk,"" Joe said, ""my name's is Joseph, but most people call me Joe.""

""That's strange,"" the other monk replied, ""my name is Moseph, and most people call me Moe. Come on in.""

Moe opened the gate and led Joe though a courtyard and into a building. They passed through a small foyer before entering into the first floor of a large tower. In the middle of the circular room there is a spiral staircase, in the center of which an intricately carved stone bench beside the bottom stair. A long, worn hemp rope dangled from high above so that its bottom just barely brushed the seat of the bench. As they walked in Joe caught sight of a man in ornate robes walking out a door on the opposite side.

""Who was that?"" Joe asked, ""His robes are much fancier than yours.""

""That's Master Poseph, and you must not speak to him,"" Moe whispered, ""You see, our last new monk was terrible, never doing any activities in a correct monk fashion. It reflected poorly on me, since I bring in all the new monks, and as such I'm putting you on a trial run. None of the other monks know you're here. I will test you. If you pass you can stay, if you fail you must leave.""

""That sounds fair,"" Joe replied.

""Alright,"" Moe said, ""Your job is to be our timekeeper. Every hour, on the hour, you will pull that rope and chime the bell a number of times equal to the hour. It's twelve forty-five right now, so in fifteen minutes you will pull the rope a single time. At two o'clock, you will pull it twice.""

""That sounds easy,"" Joe said with a smirk.

""It would be, if you had a clock,"" Moe said, with a light air in his voice and a smile on his face, ""but you must feel out the time in your mind. If you're off by more than two minutes, you will pack your bags and leave.""

""I've think I can do that.""

""Good."" Moe turned and left without saying another word, leaving Joe to his duties.

Joe took a seat on the bench and began to count under his breath. One, two, three, four, five, six and when he reached nine hundred he rose from the bench. He stretched his shoulders, flexed his muscles, and cracked his fingers, prepared to pull the rope. But just then, a better idea came into his head and he took off running at a dead sprint up the stairs. All the way up and up, up five stories of spiral stair until he reached the top, but he didn't stop--he ran into the bell forehead first and sent a wave of sound echoing through the halls of the monastery. In the library Moseph and Poseph perked their ears. Poseph was curious, for it was normally Moe's job to keep the time.

""My dear Moe, who is doing your job for you?"" Poe asked.

""Don't worry about it, Master Poe,"" Moe said quietly. Checking the wall clock he saw it was exactly one o'clock. He had hope for Joe.

Meanwhile, Joe stumbled all the way down the stairs and into the bench. His head hurt, but this was no time to give up. He began to count again: one, two, three, four, five, six, and when he reached three thousand six hundred he again took off running. Up and up, up five flights of stairs, but this time he smashed his nose into the bronze of the bell, sending forth another wave of sound. All the way down the stairs he stumbled, clutching his now broken nose. But when he reached the bottom he turned around and did it again, sending out the second chime using his cheek.

As he came down the stairs, blinking and groaning, another monk entered the tower. His name was Roseph, but most of the other monks called him Roe. Roe was curious, for he had never seen Joe before, and stood quietly in the doorway to watch him.

Nothing happened for an hour as Roe watched, but he had the patience of an experienced monk, so he didn't mind. He saw Joe muttering to himself the whole time, and Roe found himself wondering what Joe was doing. He was obviously counting, but why? Surely he didn't have to count the time between bell chimes, who would make him do that? Probably Moe or Poe, he thought. Suddenly Joe jumped up and loudly declared ""three thousand six hundred!"" and dashed up the stairs. A few seconds later, Roe heard the cracking of bone and a deep ring from above, followed by Joe coming down a few seconds later, cupping a hand over his mouth. Two more times he did this, running up, smacking the bell, and coming down. Each time he looked worse, and now Roe noticed he was missing several teeth.

Roe was incredibly curious. He hurried away and found two more monks, Toseph and Thomas. Toseph, of course, they called Toe, and Thomas they called Beau because he was an incredibly attractive man. Roe lead them to the tower, where the three of them stood and watched. Roe explained the entire situation to them and after a few minutes they puzzled out he must be a new recruit. Furthermore, he was undergoing some sort of test.

""It's quite strange,"" Toe admitted, ""I never had to do anything like that.""

""My cousin joined a monastery down south and they do this to everyone,"" Beau said.

""Yes, but we're not bullies who haze new monks,"" Roe retorted.

""There must be something special about him then,"" Beau said, with a hint of eagerness in his voice.

""You know,"" Toe piped up, ""The way he holds himself, coupled with his unorthodox methods, he sure reminds me of old Master Shoseph. He even seems willing to destroy his body for the good of the monastery--look at his forehead, his cheeks, his mouth! He'd give anything for his duty.""

""Wow, wouldn't that be a amazing!"" Roe exclaimed, ""what if this man here were to be old Master Sho reincarnated, it would be the greatest gift this monastery had ever received! Master Poe must be testing to see if it's true!""

With this in mind they waited with bated breath. Sure enough, after some time, once again Joe jumped up and exclaimed ""Three thousand six hundred!"" He began to climb the stairs with leaps and bounds, but something was off. Perhaps there was blood in his eyes from the wound on his head, or perhaps he had suffered a concussion, but he only made it half way up the stairs. His legs gave out and he tumbled over the railing. He fell, and with a thunderous smack impacted the bench, dying instantly.

Roe, Toe, and Beau looked on in shock. A few seconds passed. No chimes echoed through the monastery.

At once they all called in unison: ""Master Poe, Master Poe! Come to the tower! There's been an accident!""

Quick as a flash Poe was beside them and took in the sight of poor Joe.

""Dear god!"" He exclaimed, ""what happened here?""

Toe, barely holding back tears, was the one to respond: ""I don't know, but this man, this amazing man, he was doing such a good job we thought he was Master Sho come back to life! I don't even know who he is!""

Poe examined Joe for a few seconds.

""I certainly don't know him either, but something about him strikes me as familiar. I've definitely seen him before, because his face rings a bell.""

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------

Part 2

\---------------

Several weeks later another monk arrived at the gates. Once again, Moe greeted him. The new monk's name was Tim, and as fate had it, he was Joe's identical twin brother.

Once again, Moe gave him the speech about the test and left.

History repeated itself, because every hour on the hour Tim struck the bell with his face. This time though, none of the other monks paid him any mind. And just like with his brother, Tim fell from the tower at four o'clock, landed on the bench, and died.

The monks gathered around in sorrow, all of them.

""What a shame,"" Beau said.

""Why did we try this again?"" Toe sighed.

""Did anyone even know who he was?"" Roe asked.

""No,"" Moe muttered.

There was a long pause.

Poe bent over to get a look at Tim's face. ""Hmmm, it's funny,"" he said, ""even with all this blood on him, he's a dead ringer for that last guy.""",A man named Joseph decided to become a monk...,4

Dave takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks Dave, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

Dave walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""","A math professor, Dave, is having problems with his sink so he calls a plumber.",107

I did not write this joke, I merely found it on the internet and wanted to share it to everyone. Please comment down the original owner if you know who it is, because he deserves all the credits.

Donald Trump meets with the Queen. He asks her, ""Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can give to me?""
""Well,"" says the Queen, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""
Trump frowns. ""But how do I know the people around me are really intelligent?""
The Queen takes a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy. You just ask them to answer an intelligence riddle.""
The Queen pushes a button on her intercom. ""Please send Theresa May in here, would you?""
Theresa May walks into the room. ""Yes, your majesty?""
The Queen smiles. ""Answer me this, please, Theresa. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""
Without pausing for a moment, Theresa answers, ""That would be me.""
""Yes! Very good,"" says the Queen.
Back at the White House, Trump asks to speak with Vice President Mike Pence.
""Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""
""I'm not sure,"" says the Vice President. ""Let me get back to you on that one.""
Mike Pence goes to his advisers and asks every one, but none can give him an answer. Finally, he ends up in the men's room and recognizes General McMasters' shoes in the next stall.
Mike shouts, ""General! Can you answer this for me? Your mother and your father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?
General McMaster yells back, ""That's easy. It's me!""
Mike Pence smiles. ""Thanks!"" and goes back to the Oval Office to speak with Trump.
""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's General McMaster.""
Trump gets up, stomps over to Mike Pence, and angrily yells into his face, ""No, you idiot! It's Theresa May!""",A Donald Trump Joke,326

Many years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multimillion dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine to work but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and stated, ""This is where your problem is."" The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly: 
""One chalk mark $1. Knowing where to put it $49,999"" ",There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical.,7

1. This one has always been in front of our faces. He has been breaking into peoples houses and destroying private property. This is considered a felony.

2. He has lied on his resume. As we said before, he has committed a felony. On your resume, it asks if you have committed a felony. If you mark “yes” you are most likely not going to get the job. So the only way he could get that job is if he said “no” on it.

3. He is putting people out of a job. Because of his huge size, he can cover more ground for selling his product. That means less workers are needed to get the job done.

4. He is harassing children. In almost every ad he’s in, he is peer pressuring children into trying his drink. In fact, he only tries to sell kool aid 
To children.

5. He is hiding his business from the government. Because of the amount of felonies his job causes him to do, there is no way that his job is approved by the government. If that’s not true, then he is a mob boss with mass control over everyone. But, I believe that the 1st option of that one is most logical.",5 ways kool aid man has been committing felonies,0

Every day on the way to his little rabbit job he'd stop at this little rabbit cafe and get a grilled cheese sandwich and a coffee for his little rabbit breakfast. However, one day, he decided to shake his routine up a bit.


""Same as usual?"" said the rabbit employee to her soon to be rabbit customer, already getting out the cheese and putting on the coffee machine.



""Surprisingly, no."" said the rabbit. ""Today I fancy a change. Today, I'll have a grilled ham sandwich with my coffee.""


""If you insist!"" said the rabbit behind the counter.


Our rabbit protagonist waited for a his food and drink before paying and taking a sizeable bite of his ham sandwich. 


""How is it?"" asked the server rabbit.


""Delicious."" said the first rabbit, beaming.


The next day, he ordered the same, and so for a couple weeks a new routine was started - go to work, stop off at the cafe on the way there, get a grilled sandwich with ham and a coffee and once finished go on. Same as it used to be, but the ham made all the difference. It was an innovation, a change in the system and a bit of a boost. Small changes can have impacts, even if it's a change of flavour of your breakfast. It was doing the world of good.


After about a month of ham, the rabbit staff had grown wise to the ham change and had started making them immediately. When our rabbit friend realised this he didn't want to seem predictable, so he ordered one with egg. And the drink, well, he'd been experimenting a bit with iced coffee lately with his rabbit friends, so why not one of those?


Cut to about three months later and the routine was very different to what it once was. The bones of it were all that remained - going to the cafe while walking to work. The type of grilled sandwich and drink could be anything though. Though one day, our rabbit friend made a mistake that proved fatal.


""What's it going to be sir?"" said a rabbit cook one rainy Monday morning.


Our former routine loving rabbit paused and thought. He was dreading going to work today as his rabbit boss had called him in for a rabbit meeting and the worst was automatically being assumed. That, and he and his rabbit girlfriend had a had an argument over the weekend that could potentially end their two year long rabbit relationship. The rain dampened his mood further, so while he was going to have a salmon panini that they'd not long added to the menu that'd he'd had last Wednesday, in a moment of madness, he asked the question that would cut his rabbit life short.


""Could you put together three grilled sandwich fillings? Like ham, cheese and egg?""


""Certainly sir. Any drink?""


""One cappuccino please.""


The food arrived, the rabbit took one bite, and he promptly keeled over dead on the floor. Most of the rabbit employees and rabbit customers rushed over to help, but it was no use. While down on rabbit Earth having rabbit CPR performed on him, the rabbit was ascending to rabbit heaven. The rabbit pearly gates awaited him and rabbit St. Peter stepped forward with a big book.


""Before you see rabbit God, I must first ask you some questions."" said rabbit St. Peter opening to a page and placing the book on a lectern. ""Firstly, name?""


""John Flopsy"" said John.


""Age?"" said rabbit St. Peter, writing down the details.


""32."" answered John.


""And finally, and this is important"" said rabbit St. Peter with a grave look on his face, ""How did you die? If you can remember.""


John did remember.


""I died by mixing my toasties.""",There once was a rabbit who loved his grilled cheese sandwiches.,2
