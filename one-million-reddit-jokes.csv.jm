The next morning, he wasn't himself, kept looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head. Because the crow didn’t say how it was gonna happen, just those words: your daddy's gonna die. Well, he left home early and was gone for a long time. When he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a
very beautiful woman driving who asked, ""Are you okay?""
As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for...

""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, “ Get in and I ’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse , "" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive .  Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

So on Monday, John tells Lizzie how he feels and he asks, ""can't I just look at it?"" Lizzie responds, ""No, we have to wait, besides the wedding is only 5 days away on Saturday. Surely you can be patient."" John agrees for now he can wait, but he is still excited. 

Tuesday rolls around and John is eager again and asks Lizzie, ""Look honey, I know the wedding is close, but I can't stand it, will you just let me touch it, just real quick?"" Lizzie says no once again, citing that she wants it to be special and right and that really the wedding is only 4 days away now. Again John agrees it's probably for the best. 

Wednesday comes and John is as frustrated as ever, so he decides to press his luck and ask her, ""honey I know we are saving ourselves but I am dying here. Can I..well...can I at least smell it?"" Lizzie thinks about it for a minute and says ""yes, but you have to close your eyes.""

post,8i5sr4,2qh72,jokes,false,1525871012,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8i5sr4/my_favourite_math_pun/,self.jokes,,"There were once 3 kingdoms that bordered the same lake. In the middle of the lake there was an island, and the 3 kingdoms had been fighting over it for years. No one seemed to be able to keep the upper hand for very long and no one had been victorious. The wars over this little island were very costly, but all 3 kingdoms wanted it because of its great beauty and resources.

Finally, the monarchs agreed to a way to settle the matter permanently. Each would send their knights and squires to the island and they would
fight it out. Whoever’s knights and squires won the day would keep the island forever.

One kingdom sent many knights and each knight had a few squires. The night before the battle, the knights polished their armor while the squires readied the weapons. When the armor was finished, the knights sat around the fire drinking.

The second kingdom sent more knights than the first and each knight had several squires. The night before the battle, the knights drank around the fire while the squires scurried about polishing armor and readying weapons.

The third kingdom only sent one knight and he had only one squire. While the squire polished armor and readied the weapons, the knight hung a single pot from the tallest branch of the tree and tied a rope with a loop at the end from another branch. Then the knight sat by the fire and drank while the squire kept working.

The fateful day came and all the squires came out to the battlefield. (The knights had stayed up too long drinking.) The battle was fierce. In the
end, only the lone squire from the third kingdom was left standing. Proving once again, the age old theorem:

The squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate  counter\-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in  opposite directions.

First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and  multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the  richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the  sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""  Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a  fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered  for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your  wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms  around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Three guys are walking through the woods when they find a lamp.,414

""Of course not!"" the muslim girl said unnervingly and got off the camel.

Before the suicidal muslim man left the camel, the camel driver stops him and says, ""I know how you can screw her: On Fridays, she prays at the local mosque. While she is praying, dress as Allah and she'll have sex with you. Put on a hijab, burkha, and a lot of c4.""

That Friday, the muslim man takes the advice, gets into the costume and hides behind a Hijab. Shortly, the muslim girl appears and prays.

The muslim man pops out from the hijab and declares, ""I am Allah, and I command you to have sex with me.""

The muslim girl replies, ""Sure, but only if we have anal sex.""

So they have anal sex.

After sex the muslim man rips off his burkha and laughs, I'm not Allah! I'm that muslim man from the camel! Ha!""

Immediately the muslim girl rips off her burkha and says ""Ha! I'm the Camel!""

It's not that her delivery or stage presence is bad. It's simply because she's using extremely tired and outdated material. To put it frankly, the audience was sick and tired of hearing the same damn jokes that had been told time after time on that stage.

After her set was over, she's drinking alone at the bar when a man comes up to her, clearly trying to hit on her. She immediately shoots him down but the man is stubborn and decides to change his approach some, having seen her tank on stage just a few minutes before.

Quickly, he comes up with a convincing lie. ""I didn't want to tell you, at first but I'm a professional comedy writer. I noticed that you were using some old material up there. I can help you re-package the same jokes and make them funny again.""

Immediately, the young lady perks up and is very interested in the man's proposition. ""What will it cost me?"" she asks candidly.

""All I want, in exchange for re-writing your jokes, is to spend the night with you.""

The young lady hesitantly agrees and tells the man to meet her at her apartment later.

Sure enough, he meets her at her place and they go at it like rabbits for several hours. Afterwards, feeling a bit guilty about his lie, he says, ""I have a confession to make. I'm not really a comedy writer.""

One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no actual address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about. The letter read: 

Dear God, 

I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. 

Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension payment. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with, have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me? 

Sincerely, 
Edna 

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars. 

By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends. 

Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. 
It read:

Dear God, 

How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. 

P.S. By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it might have been those bastards at the post office.

All good things must come to an end though, and one day they attempted to rob a bank with a gay security guard.  Unfazed by Dria's beauty, he shot her dead.

The gang was so aggrieved that they risked being caught to take her body with them.  But they soon realized they needed to get rid of it.  An electrical generation plant was being built in the business district, colloquially known as ""The Sell"", so they went there, found some wet concrete at the site, and put her in it.  Her body wasn't noticed, more concrete was poured over her, and she became forever entombed there and forgotten.

The kid is spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it between his teeth. As they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat. He immediately starts choking, going blue in the face, and Dad starts panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed middle-aged, moderately attractive but serious woman in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading her newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down on the saucer, neatly folds her newspaper and places it on the counter. Then she gets up from her seat and makes her unhurried way across the market.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully takes hold of the boy's testicles and squeezes gently at first and then ever more firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the 25 cent piece, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand. Releasing the boy, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat in the
coffee bar without saying a word.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill-effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts effusively thanking her saying, ""I've never seen anybody do anything like that before-it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?""

""Good heavens, no,"" the woman replies. ""I am a Divorce Attorney.""",[NEW TO r/jokes.DON'T KNOW IF A REPOST] A dad walks into a market followed by his ten-year-old son.,5

Newton says ""We were going 92 miles per hour when we were pulled over - and here's the differential equation that proves it.""

The yogi being very disciplined, kept his eyes shut and stayed focused on his meditation.

Thinking the Yogi must be a bit hard of hearing the traveler says a little louder ""Hey there do you mind if I come warm up by the fire with you?!""

Finally the old Yogis attention was broken and he opened his eyes, turning to the traveler and says with a bit of annoyance in his voice ""Can't you see? I'm trying to meditate.""

Apologizing, the traveler went on their way.

But, they hadn't got very far before they started to think ""I wonder what kind of meditation he's doing?""

So they returned to find the old Yogi back in his quiet meditative pose.

""Um..excuse me"" they asked, once again interrupting him. ""What sort of meditation are you doing?

“Not a chance!”

He surveys the destruction all around us. “What happened here?”

I stare at the smoking remains of my house and mutter, “Doom.”

The Police officer nods. “Yes quite, and gloom too, but how did this happen? I need to take a statement to confirm some of the more graphic complaints we received.”

Where to even begin. At the start I suppose. “Well, you know how they moved the baby naming registry entirely online a few years ago? Turns out that was a terrible idea. I had one job to do, type our beautiful baby girls name into that system, but I messed it up. My wife wanted this really weird spelling, so i copied and pasted from her email, but I guess it didn’t copy properly. I pasted nonsense into the first name field instead. I was half asleep, you have to understand I’ve barely slept. I didn't check it before clicking submit.”

“Sir, I’m not following at all. What does this have to do with the incident?”

“I called our beautiful baby girl %5E2019F. Turns out it kind of broke the universe. Whatever lazy hack of an alien programmer built our version of the simulation, I guess they forgot to protect against stack overflows. Next thing you know, my baby girl’s corrupting everything she touches. I totally broke her programming.”

I see the Police officer reaching for his tazer. “Have you been drinking sir?”

“I wish! Anyway, i thought I could fix it if I could just reboot her. Turns out that was harder than I anticipated. I could barely get a bog standard OS up and running before she’d crash and reboot. In the end I went to every programmers failsafe.”

The cop looks up and smirks. “You turned her off and back on again?”

“Kind of. I installed the one program that is sure to run on any machine, no matter how broken. I installed DOOM on her.”

Now I was really ticking all the crazy person boxes. The officer raises an eyebrow. “Doom? The video game? On your daughter?”

“Yes, exactly! I didn’t actually think it would run, i was just desperate for a result. You can’t imagine how upset my wife has been.”

The officer makes a few notes in his notebook. “So what happened?”

“Well, she punched me in the face and ran straight to the shed. She couldn’t even walk 2 seconds earlier, but off she dashed. Next thing you know I hear the chainsaw. Have you ever seen an infant with a chainsaw? Neither had I. Anyway, I thought she was done, that maybe I could lock her in the shed and wait until she ran out of gas, but she just wanted it to get into my gun cabinet. I’ve never seen anyone load a 12 gauge so quickly. Then she screamed SATAN, which was her first word by the way, and stormed around the house shooting up the place. Eventually she hit the gas main line, and, well you can see how that turned out.”

Another squad car arrives and the cop says, “This really is a fascinating story sir. I think it might be best if you come down to the station to figure this out.”

“Not a chance, she’s still down there.”

He laughs. “You’re scared of your baby? Where is your little bundle of joy now?”

“She’s right behind you.”

The cop spins, a big dumb grin on his face, to find an infant wielding an oddly familiar pistol with fire in her eyes. He reaches for his gun only to find it missing. He screams up at me, “Oh my god, what do I do?”

“I suggest you join me up here in this tree. She can’t aim up.”

The students are clearly amazed with  the items he has on display.

King leans over the desk to pick up a jar to show the children.

“I’m often asked,’ he says with words thick with the sounds of Maine, “where do I get the inspiration for my stories? I tell them I have the heart of a ten-year-old boy. And here it is.”

The young scribes gasp, then chuckle as King smirks away.

A young lady points to the raven in the corner. “Oh, he’s beautiful. What’s his name?”.  

“That crittah is Zoltan, and he stops in to let me know my story is moving in the right direction.”

A young man picks up a scrimshaw turtle, carved of ivory. He holds it up to King with a curious look on his face.

“Ayuh, that there is Maturin, the guardian of us all. His thought is slow, but always kind. He holds us all within his mind.” 

The matronly English instructor picks up an item and examines it closely. “I presume,"" she proclaims with disdain, ""that this flower with the thick stalk represents the rose; its salty tang embodying the sweat that went into building the Dark Tower, and the liquid escaping symbolizing your difficulty escaping the evil influence of alcohol.”

""That sounds like fun; I'm in!"" Replied the second man, Tom.

""But how will we measure who's goes the highest?"" inquired Jim, the third man.

""Simple,"" exclaimed Joe, ""the higher your brick goes, the deeper it will embed itself into the mud when it lands. That's how we'll decide the victor.""

""Sounds fair to me!"" said Tom, grabbing a brick and stepping out into the clearing. ""I'll go first."" He took the brick in two hands, bent his knees, and threw the brick with everything he had. It went up, and it went down, landing with a satisfying *thud* and *squish*.

""Four inches,"" he announced, ""I can do better than that!"" He squared his posture, took the brick in both hands, and with even more power than Tom had, he launched the brick to the skies. It went up, up, and it went down.

""Tom measured the depth of the hole, and, defeated, said, ""six and a half inches.""

""My turn,"" said Jim cheerily. He stepped out into the clearing, grabbed the brick with his right hand, and with unnatural speed and power, shot the brick toward the clouds above like a trebuchet. It went up, up, up, up, up, until neither Joe nor Tom could see it anymore, and it never came down.

...

Okay, I can tell that one fell flat a bit, so enjoy this joke as a sort of consolation:

A woman wanted to fly to Paris with her pet parrot to attend her mother's funeral, but it was such short notice that the only flight she could afford was on a no smoking, no parrot airline. As anyone would, she hid the parrot in her coat and boarded the plane. After the plane was in the air, the pilot handed over control to the copilot and began walking down the aisle with a massive cigar in his mouth and making small talk with the passengers. He arrived at the woman's row and asked her how the flight was going, his voice slightly hard to understand because of the sheer size of the cigar.

""It's wonderful,"" she said, ""because the weather outside is so nice, I could look out the window forever.""

""I'm glad,"" said the pilot, and just as he was turning to move on, he heard something: *SQUAACK!*

He whipped back around and glared accusingly at the woman. ""Miss, you don't happen to have a bird on this plane, do you?""

""Of course no-"" *SQUAAACK!*

Furious, the pilot lept forward and ripped open her coat, grabbed the parrot, and began waving it around wildly like some conductor of the weirdest orchestras in the world. ""YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A PARROT ON THIS PLANE!"" he bellowed before opening the window, tossing the bird out, and promptly closing it again.

The woman, equally enraged, grabbed the cigar out of the pilot's mouth, and waved it around in a similar fashion, yelling ""YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A CIGAR ON THIS PLANE!"", and she opened the window, threw out the cigar, and closed it again.

The pilot stormed back off to the cockpit, no longer in the mood to talk to passengers.

Around an hour had passed when the pilot heard a knocking on the cockpit's side window. He ignored it, figuring it was a figment of his imagination, but then again, a knocking. He glanced over, then did a double take. Flying alongside the plane was none other than the parrot he had thrown out the window. And what was in his mouth? The brick.

For decades, the king's had argued over it's true owner, each claiming to be the first kingdom to settle there, and many tales of magical swords and godly favours to claim divine right. Eventually, this story telling and legal battling came to no conclusion, so the kings decided to go to war.


The first kingdom is very wealthy, and has a grand army of thousands of Knights in shining armour with state of the art squires and weaponry, expertly trained killing machines.

The second kingdom is moderately well off, and has several hundred Knights in standard armour with enough squires to get by, but all willing in heart and mind.

The third kingdom is very poor, and has only one elderly Knight with his great grandson for a squire, in rusty centuries old armour.


On the eve before the battle, each kingdom decides to have a celebration for the great deeds that are about to be done.

The first kingdom has a great banquet that no words can give justice to, a massive, endless hall of food and delight, dancers and jesters and bards as plentiful as the fine wine and boar that accompanies them.

The second kingdom has not nearly as grand an occasion, but makes the most of what they have, making up for the lack of fine food and entertainment with enough ale to knock out an elephant.

The third kingdom has but scraps to make do with. In fact, so little food do they have that there is only enough for the Knight and boy squire alone to have a feast (a feast by their standards, at least). The elderly Knight is too weak and tired to get up, so the squire prepares the meal. He decides to cook a stew, so hangs a pot over a fire with a noose and cooks what they have into a small broth.


Finally, the great day dawns. The kings did not sleep through the night, and sent their generals to ready their armies. The world sat on tenderhooks.

However, fate had taken a strange turn. The armies from the first and second kingdoms had drunk so much in their revels that not one remained conscious, much to the fury of their leaders. And in the third kingdom, the elderly Knight's back had gone, and he could not stand. The kings were left speechless. There was only one option.


The squires must go to war.


So on the battlefield, a hundred thousand squires in tunics too big for them and wooden swords trampled the ground beneath them as they came to the edge. One gigantic behemoth of an army met the other small but willing force at the peak of the lake.

And the squire of the third kingdom faced them all.


The battle began. Heads were clubbed in, backs broken, knees twisted, hair pulled, and slowly the numbers remaining dwindled. As the hours swept by and the body piles grew high, the kings and their people watched in the greatest suspense the lake ever knew.


And as the sun set, and the dust cleared, finally, a single figure stood atop the mountain of bodies beneath him, victorious. The squire of the third kingdom had won.


This goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is greater than the sum of the squires of the other two sides of the triangle.

Then he got an idea. He had seen elephants life one leg, and even two legs. Once in a circus he'd even seen an elephant lift three legs in the air and stand on just one.

So Reggie announced to anyone who could make his elephant stand in the air on no legs. However each person who wanted to try would have to pay a hundred dollars.

People came from near and far. They tried everything from coaxing to hypnotism, but no one could make the elephant rise up in the air.

The one day a blue convertible drove up and a little man got out and addressed Reggie: ""Is it true that you'll pay ten thousand dollars if I make your elephant get off all four legs?""

""Yes,"" Reggie said, ""but you've got to pay one hundred dollars to try.""

The little man handed Reggie a hundred dollar bill. Then he went back to the car and took out a metal club. He walked up to the elephant and looked him inn the eye. Then he walked behind the elephant and swung hard, hitting the elephant smack on the balls. The elephant let out a roar and flew up into the air.

After the little man had collected his ten thousand dollars, Reggie was very depressed. He'd only taken in eight thousand dollars and now he'd not only lost a couple grand but still had the problem of feeding and housing the elephant.

Suddenly Reggie got another inspiration. He knew that elephants could move their heads up and down, but he had never seen one move from side to side. So he announced that he would pay ten thousand dollars to anyone who could make his elephant move his head from side to side. However, each person who wanted to try would have to pay one hundred dollars.

People came from near and far. They paid their hundred and they tried, but, of course, no one succeeded.

Then just when things were going well, a familiar blue convertible drove up and the little man came out. He addressed Reggie: ""Is it true that you'll pay me ten thousand dollars if i can make your elephant move his head from side to side?""

""Yes,"" Reggie said, ""but you've got to pay one hundred dollars to try.""

The little man handed Reggie the hundred dollars. Then he returned to his car and took out his metal club. He walked up the elephant.

""Do you remember me?"" he asked.

The elephant nodded by shaking his head up and down.

""Do you want me to do it again?""

The elephant quickly shook his head . . . no.",Reggie's Elephant,1

The priest asks if he would like to confess his sins and the man replies that he used the ""F-word"" over the weekend.


The priest says, ""Oh okay, just say three Hail Marys and try to watch your language.""


The man replies that he would like to confess as to why he said the ""F-word"". The priest sighs and tells him to continue.


Well father I played golf on Sunday with my buddies instead of going to church.


The priest says, ""And you got upset over that and swore?""


The man replied, ""No, that wasn't why I swore. On the first tee I duck-hooked my drive well left into the trees.""


The priest said, ""And that's when you swore.""


The man replied, a little testily because of the constant interruptions, ""No, it wasn't. When I walked up the fairway, I noticed my ball got a lucky bounce and I had a clear shot to the green. However, before I could hit the ball, a squirrel ran by and grabbed my ball and scurried up a tree.""


The priest asked, ""Is that when you said the 'F-word'?""


The man replied, ""No, because an eagle then flew by and caught the squirrel in its sharp talons and flew away.""


The priest let out a breath and queried, ""Is that when you swore?""


The man replied, ""No, because the eagle flew over the green and the dying squirrel let go of my golf ball and it landed within 5 inches of the hole.""

“My, my,” said the Poodle, “I guess it’s hopeless. That’s just as dumb as the Lab’s sentence.” 

She then turns to the last of the three dogs and says, “How about you, little guy?” 

The last of the three, tiny in stature but big in fame and finesse, is the chihuahua.

There's a fly sitting about a foot above a river.

Now there's a salmon in the river looking up at the fly thinking ""you know, if that fly drops down six inches, I could jump up and snatch it and I'm gonna have a good dinner tonight.""

Now there's a bear behind a bush, who's looking at the salmon, who's looking at the fly, and he's thinking ""you know, if that fly drops down six inches, that salmon will jump up to snatch it, and then I can lurch out to grab it and I'm gonna have a good dinner tonight.""

Now there's a hunter in a tree, who's looking at the bear, who's looking at the salmon, who's looking at the fly, and he's thinking ""you know, if that fly drops down six inches, the salmon will jump up to snatch it, the bear will lurch out to grab it, then I'll have a better shot and I'm gonna have a good dinner tonight.""

Now there's a mouse at the bottom of the tree, who's looking at the hunter (who's eating a cheese sandwich), who's looking at the bear, who's looking at the salmon, who's looking at the fly, and he's thinking ""you know, if that fly drops down six inches, the salmon will jump up to snatch it, the bear will lurch out to grab it, the hunter will drop his cheese sandwich to take his shot and I'm gonna have a good dinner tonight.""

Now there's a cat in a bush who's looking at the mouse, who's looking at the hunter, who's looking at the bear, who's looking at the salmon, who's looking at the fly, and he's thinking ""you know, if that fly drops down six inches, the salmon will jump up to snatch it, the bear will lurch out to grab it, the hunter will drop his cheese sandwich to take his shot, the mouse will scurry over to eat it, then I can pounce on the mouse, and I'm gonna have a good dinner tonight.""

So, the fly drops down six inches, the salmon jumps up to snatch it, the bear lurches out to grab it, the hunter drops his cheese sandwich and takes his shot, the mouse scurries over to eat the cheese, the cat pounces, but he misses and lands in the river!

Moral of the story: That fly drops down six inches and you've got a wet pussy.",A fun joke to say when you're drunk,14

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,15
