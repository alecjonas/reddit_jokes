Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible last days. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

While cleaning out his office, he finds a long forgotten, huge,old-timey pickle jar stuffed with foreskins in formaldehyde.  As a younger and more brash doctor, he used to save every foreskin from each circumcision as a sort of momento.

As he looked at the jar, he remembered all the good times he had as a young doctor, and became nostalgic.   He came to the conclusion that he just couldnt  put the jar of foreskins in the trash.  

So he decided to take the jar to his old friend the leathermaker down the street, and see if anything could be done.

The leathermaker, although he found the request strange, agreed to give it a try.  He told the doctor to check back in a few weeks.

The doctor was so excited he counted the days.  He decided he would check back in exactly 3 weeks.  On day 21 he walked back into the leatherman's shop.

""Were you able to figure anything out with the foreskins?"" He asked the Leatherman.

""You are in luck "" said the leatherman. 

The leatherman placed a brown leather bi-fold mens wallet on the counter with a very proud smile plastered across his face.

""What!?!"" Exclaimed the doctor.  ""There must have been 3 or 4 thousand foreskins in that jar!   All you could come up with was this little bitty wallet?!?!""

""Whoa, whoa,whoa!"" Said the leatherman. ""I dont think you understand.  Yes, i just handed you a wallet, but what you dont know is that if you rub it for 5 minutes, it turns into a steamer trunk!!""

post,721i7t,2qh72,jokes,false,1506206966,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/721i7t/coin_flip/,self.jokes,,"One day, Bob came home from school and proudly told his father, “My teacher taught us about the probability of a coin flip today!  A coin will land on heads 50% of the time all the time!”

Bob’s father: That’s... not quite how it works.

Bob: Nuh-uh!  My teacher said so!

Bob’s father: Well the educational system is garbage.

Bob: Huh?

Bob’s father: Nothing.

Seeing a lesson that needed to be taught, Bob’s father pulled out a coin and told his son, “Alright son, I bet you that this coin will land on heads.  If you win, I’ll buy you ice cream.  If I win, you’ll have to do the chores for the rest of the day.”

Bob: Deal.

Bob’s father casually flips the coin and it lands on heads.

Bob: How could this happen?

Bob's father: Because it's a small sample size.  It doesn't reflect the actual probability.

Bob: Let's try again, it has to even out by landing on tails next time!

Bob’s father: Let’s raise the stakes this time.  I'll flip the coin three times.  If it lands on tails for any of them, you win and I'll buy you a tub of ice cream.  If it lands on heads for all of them, you'll have to do the chores for the rest of the week.

Bob: Ok.

Bob's father flips the coin again and to Bob's amazement, it lands on heads each time.

Bob: That can't be right!  Why did this happen?

Bob's father: Because it's an outlier.  It doesn't usually happen, but it'll show up from time to time across large data sets.

Bob: That makes sense.  I bet it'll land on tails a lot in the next few flips.

Bob's father: You still don't get it.  That's the gambler's fallacy.  I'll flip the coin five more times.  If you win, I'll buy you Half-Life 3.  If I win, you'll have to do the chores for the rest of the month.

Bob: Fine.

Amazingly, all five coin flips resulted in heads.

Bob: That's impossible!  How could this happen?

Bob's father: Because this is a miracle!  The chances of this happening are about the chances your mom and I's marriage would have worked out.

Bob: That's not why she left.

Bob's father: Truth is stranger than fiction.

Bob: I don't believe this.  It has to land on tails eventually.

Bob's father: The lesson doesn't seem to be sinking in.  Let's go big.  I'll flip the coin seven more times.  If you win, I'll buy you anything you want.  If I win, you'll have to do the chores until you go to college.

Bob hesitates for a moment in deep contemplation before finally nodding in agreement.

With each subsequent flip landing on heads, the life in Bob's eyes died a little.  When the final flip landed on heads, a single tear rolled down Bob's cheek.

Bob: Why, dad?  Why?

Bob's father: Because this is a two-headed coin.",Coin flip,35

Alice was gorgeous - fit in every way - but was recently engaged and very much in love with her fiance whom she hoped to be reunited with shortly.  

The three passed the days as chums, building a modest shelter, gathering firewood, and hunting for food.  Six months passed and the three had not seen a single boat or airplane pass by the island.  Morale was beginning to nosedive like the plane they had crashed on.  Alice, contemplating the sheer hopelessness decided that it might be OK for her to fool around with Ted and Phillip.  And fool around they did!  Sex three and four times a day, in each and every way!  And morale rose to it's highest point every!  

They tore down the dumpy shelter and built a seven room home.  They built lobster traps and distilled a fine alcohol from the raw coconut milk.  They found soft, fibrous plants and twisted the fibers into threads which they wove into cloth which they tailored into very very fine clothes.  And during it all it was sex, sex, sex!  Morning, Noon and night!  And late-morning, mid-afternoon, and early evening!  

Tragedy struck one sad day when Alice waded out into the water to wash her hair, which she did regularly.  This time, however, she stepped on a stingray!  The toxin from the stingray's barb didn't kill her, but she went into shock and drowned before she could get herself to shore.

Ted and Phillip were beyond distraught when the found Alice's body washed up on the sand soon after.  Sure she was a great cook, a fantastic seamstress and witty companion, but it was the sex!  Holy Cow the sex!  It was, at it's core,  the only thing giving them the will to live.  

Ted and Phillip were both straight shooters, but after a few days the urges grew beyond what they could cope with and they engaged in sexual relations!!  All day and in every way!  That night, however,  they were both disgusted with themselves and what they'd done. So they reluctantly buried Alice.

He tries to take it out, but no matter what he does, he can't. So he decides to go to the hospital for medical attention. The hospital is across town, so he takes the subway, where he keeps to himself and acts nonchalantly about it as to not draw attention to his peculiar predicament.  

A concerned woman notices this odd sight and approaches him, tapping him on the shoulder. Timidly she whispers, ""Excuse me sir, but did you know you have a carrot sticking out of your ear?"" 

The subway is loud so the man can't hear her. He gives her a blank stare and asks her to speak louder. 

The kind passenger repeats in a regular voice, ""Did you know you have a carrot sticking out of your ear?""  

Still unable to hear over the noise of the subway, the man gives a curious look and again asks her to speak even louder. 

Getting flustered, she says in an even louder voice, ""I wanted you to know that you have a carrot sticking out of your ear!"".

The man looks confused at this point because he still can't hear her, but he asks her once again to please speak louder. 

The woman, truly annoyed at this point, shouts as loud as she can, ""YOU HAVE A FUCKING CARROT STICKING OF YOUR EAR!!""  

The man looks at her in bewilderment and says ""I'm really sorry, but I just can't hear you. Can't you see I have a carrot sticking out of my ear?""",A man is making dinner,1

This time, please, think a little harder!” Pole scratches his head a little more, says, “Well, I think…yeah, I’d like the Chinese to invade Poland again!” Genie just stares at him in disgust, vanishes, and whoom! There’s the Chinese hordes ravaging Poland again. When the dust clears, the Genie finds the Pole again, sitting on the ground this time because the second invasion didn’t even leave any rubble to sit on. Genie goes, “You have to tell me — why? Why’d you make such a stupid masochistic wish, twice in a row?” And the Pole smiles for the first time, says, “See, for the Chinese army to invade Poland, it has to cross Russia!”",Polish Peasant finds a genie lamp,1

years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop
and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a
doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.

The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.

She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled
back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.

Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and
the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.

The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor
laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his
bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.

She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me
and I didn't listen to you.

""What do you mean?"" asked his wife.

""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!",Don't Fart In Bed,280

The next man decides to stay here too. He walks up the pink driveway, knocks on the pink door, talks to the pink lady, walks up the pink staircase, walks down the pink hallway, walks into another pink room, sets his things down on the pink floor, lies down on the pink bed, and goes to sleep.

The next man decides to do the same thing. So the man walks up the pink driveway, knocks on the pink door, talks to the pink lady, walks up the pink staircse, walks down the pink hallway, walks into the (guess what color) PINK room, lies down on the pink bed and goes to sleep.

The next day the first man got out of bed wlaked down the pink hallway, walked down the pink staircase, and walked into the pink kitchen for breakfast.

The second man got out of bed, walked down the pink hallway, walked down the pink staircase, and walked into the pink kitchen for breakfast.

The third man got out of bed, walked down the pink hallway, walked down the pink staircase, and walked into the pink kitchen for breakfast.

The pink lady then asked them, ""What would you nice gentlemen like for breakfast? I have Cheerios and Fruit Loops.""

The first man said after thinking long and hard about it, ""I think I'm gonna have Cheerios.""

The second man after thinking long and hard about it said, ""I think I'll have the same.""

The third man after thinking long and hard about it politely answered, ""I would like some Fruit Loops if it's not too much trouble please.""

And the moral of the story is: The ratio of men liking Cheerios and Fruit Loops is 2:1.","Pink lady, pink house.",0

And then he proudly proceeded to demonstrate to her what it was for. Maria was pleased. After their honeymoon was over, Pedro returned to work. On returning home in the evening after his first day at work posthoneymoon, Pedro found a very upset Maria waiting on their front porch.

'Pedro, you said you were the only man in the world with one of those and yet today, when I saw Gonzalez changing his clothes behind the shed, he had one, too!'

Ever a fast thinker on his feet, Pedro said, 'Oh, Maria, Gonzalez is my best friend. Since I had two, I gave him one. So he is the only other man in the world with one.'

A skeptical Maria accepted this answer, but when Pedro returned home from work the following evening, an agitated Maria was waiting on the porch.

He will fix a leaky pipe for 1 Snickers bar, put up drywall for a whole box of Snickers bars, or build a house for a semi trailer full of Snickers bars.

Max is called in to assess the damage and repair the levee as quickly as possible. He looks at the levee and sees that the main issue with the levee is the sides are worn down from the storm but should be relatively easy to fix. He gives his assessment to the mayor and notes that his request for payment would be a box of Snickers bars due to the relative ease of the job.

The mayor agrees to this and sends her secretary to the store to buy the box of Snickers for Max. In a short while, the secretary comes back with the news that there are no more Snickers in the town. They were out before the hurricane and no shipments came in due to the storm. The mayor relays this information to Max.

Max has to make a decision. Should he continue to help the town even though he won't be paid, or should he request another form of payment. He thinks and thinks about it and then responds, ""I can side this dike with no candy bars.""",A levee is in need of repair after a hurricane,0

Two genius economists A and B were arguing about how incentives motivate changes in behaviour. They walked past a pile of dog dung, and A said to B:

“I’ll give you 50 million dollars if you eat that pile of dog dung!”

B thought about it, worked out its cost and benefit analysis, and concluded it was worth it.

So A lost 50 million dollars, but B was left with a bad taste in his mouth.

Then they walked past another pile of dog dung. By then B was already vomiting in disgust, but A was also feeling sorry for losing 50 million dollars.

So B proposed to A:

“I’ll give you back the 50 million dollars if you eat that dog dung.”

A proceed with his own cost-benefit analysis, and also concluded it was worth it.

So A got back his money, while B felt he got his revenge.

Then both of them realized that they’ve accomplished nothing but each had eaten a pile of dog dung.

They couldn’t work out how their cost-benefit analysis have led to this outcome, so they sought advice from their head of department, a professor that is very well-known in his field.

To their surprise, the professor cried in delight. After a while, he calmed down, and exclaimed:

“One hundred million! One hundred million!” He continued to explain.

“Together you ate two piles of dog dung, but you’ve contributed one hundred million to the nation’s GDP!”",Two genius economists were arguing about how incentives motivate changes in behaviour,6

The bank's president and others enjoy a good laugh at the woman for using a $250,000 Rolls-Royce as collateral for a $5,000 loan. A bank employee then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage.

Two weeks later, the woman returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which is $25.41. The loan officer says ""Miss, we are happy to have your business, but we’re a little puzzled. We checked you out, and you're a multi-millionaire. Why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

The woman replies, ""Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $25.41 and expect it to be there when I return?""","A woman walks into a bank in New York City and says she's going to Europe for 2 weeks, and needs to borrow $5,000.",332
