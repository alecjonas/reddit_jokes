But after weeks and weeks of trying to teach the bird to speak. All it does is sit there. Staring blankly at the wall.

One night as the man attempted to teach the bird to talk. He grows inpatient and angry.

""You know what ass hole bird! Fuck you! you dumb ass piece of shit!"" The man yelled at the blank eyed bird.

Later that night as the man got ready for bed. He heard something. 

""Braaackkkk! FUCK YOU! ASS HOLE! DUMB ASS!"" The Parrot screeched! 

The man was taken back. He thought to himself. At least the thing was talking now.

Problem was. Now the bird wouldn't shut up. ""FUCK YOU! ASS HOLE! Dumb ASS!"" the Bird would screech. Over and over again. Day and night, rain or shine. ""FUCK YOU! ASS HOLE! DUMB ASS!""

After a few weeks of this. The man was at his wits end.

One night as he sat trying to eat his dinner. All he could hear was the bird. ""FUCK YOU! ASS HOLE! DUMB ASS!""

The man lost his mind. In a fury he rushed the bird cage. Snatched the startled bird. Opened the freezer door of his refrigerator and threw the bird inside. Slamming the door shut.

After finishing his dinner quietly. The man began to feel guilty. It was after all. His fault the bird had learned those words.

So he opened he freezer door and to his surprise the Parrot gently fluttered out and landed on the mans shoulder.

The parrot nuzzled close to the man ear and whispered.

""Sorry about all the ruckus. I'm sorry it strained our friendship. I'll try and be a better pet..""

The man gasped at the parrots demeanor and intelligence. ""Ok, sure thing. I'm sorry for cursing at you. I'll try and be a better owner.""

The parrot nodded. ""But, before we go any further master. Can I ask a question?""  

""Well, of course"" the man replied.

""What the fuck did the chicken say to you!?""

Never arrived to class on time and always made sure to make a huge fuss about it.

Didn't talk to her all that much, but I had a few conversations with her.
 
Her wrists had cuts and burns all over them. She wore t-shirts so she never hid them.

I asked her why she would hurt herself like that. 

She said ""No one loves me and my life is painful"" etc., etc.

""No one loves you? What about your parents or your boyfriend?""

Answer she gave me was something like ""They actually don't love me,"" or some shit like that. 

Made a point to not interact with her too much after that, because she's too much of an attention whore. 

End of the school year, she came up to me and asked if I wanted to go somewhere with her that Sunday. 

I'm not good with these situations, so I couldn't say no, even though I didn't like her.

Sunday came, and we went to one of those tower car parks. 

Just as we got to the top, she told me that she wanted me to be here as a witness for her suicide. 

""Oh shit,"" I thought. She was going to jump and was forcing me to watch! 

Had I known that she was going to do this, I wouldn't have gone with her. 

""Not watching unless you do a flip."" I said that to try and shock her into realizing this was stupid. 

Complete shock was written all over her face. She thought I'd try and stop her.

 ""E-eh? You're not going to stop me?"" 

""No, go on ahead. If you really wanted to live, you'd stop yourself."" 

After a while, she got off the ledge. She walked up to me afterwards and tried to hug me with tears in her eyes, but I told her I loved someone else. She asked me who, and I told her to read the first letter of *every line.﻿*",A girl in my class was a total attention whore,25

""Well, Sven, how's your diet?""

""Oh, dat Olga one fine cook, I eat like a horse -- real balanced meals, yah, and take de vitamins too"".

""Well, how's work?  Stressful?""

""Oh, noooo! Love that place! Want to work there forever!""

So, the doctor is coming up with nothing and finally asks Sven,
""So, how's your sex life?  Pretty normal or are you too tired to get busy with Olga?""

""Oh, doctor, it's perfectly normal.  We get up in the morning -- have de sex 2 -- maybe 3 time - just like ever'body, then I go to work.  Run home at lunch for Olga's good cookin' and we have de sex 1 - maybe 2 time -- before I go back to work. Then in the evenings, we have dinner, maybe watch a little TV and then -- just like everybody else, have de sex 6 - 7 - maybe 8 time and go to sleep. Just like normal -- you know, like everybody does""

The doctor is astonished and then finally says,

""Well, Sven, I've got to tell you, I'm pretty sure it's all the sex with Olga that's wearing you down. You two probably need to cut back significantly""

After a few laughs and drinks, one of them had to go to the rest room The ones who stayed behind began to talk about their kids and their successes.

The first guy says: “I am very proud of my son, he is my pride and joy. He started working at a very successful company at the bottom of the barrel. He studied Economics, Business Administration, and was promoted, began to climb the corporate ladder, becoming the General Manager, and now he is the president of the company. He became so rich that he gave his best friend a top of the line Mercedes Benz for his birthday.”

The second guy says: “Damn, that's terrific! My son is also my pride and joy, I am very proud of him. He started working at a travelling agency for a very big airline. He went to flight school to become a pilot and managed to become a partner in the company where he now owns the majority of the assets. He became so rich that he gave his best friend a brand new jet for his birthday.”

The third guy says: “Well, well, well congratulations! My son is also my pride and joy and he is also very rich. He studied in the best universities and became an Engineer. He started his own construction company and became very successful and a multimillionaire. He also gave away some very nice and expensive thing to his best friend for his birthday. He built a 30,000 sq. ft. mansion especially for his friend.”

The three friends congratulated each other mutually for the successes of their sons. The fourth friend who earlier had gone to rest room returned and asked: “What's going on, what are all the congratulations for?” One of the three said: “We were talking about the pride we feel for the successes of our sons. What about your son?”

The fourth man replied: “My son is Gay and he makes a living dancing as a stripper at a nightclub.”

The three friends said: “What a shame that must be, that is horrible, what a disappointment you must feel.”

The fourth man replied: “No, I am not ashamed. Not at all. He is my son and I love him just as well, he is my pride and joy. In addition, he is very lucky too.

He offers them a challenge: ""If you succed in our 3 holy tasks, we will let you live. First: Drink 2 litres of our strongest moonshine. Second: Go to the dark cave and kill the bloodthirsty bear living there. And third: Sneak into the camp of our rival tribe and rape their chieftains' daughter."" Desperately the 3 men agree.

Being an experienced drinker he manages to trink 1 1/2 litres of the evil stuff. Just as he goes for the rest he blacks out and dies of alcohol poisoning. Third goes the russian. After downing the 2 litre of moonshine in one gulp he asks for more. Having finished another litre he proceeds to waddle to the cave. The natives are mightyly impressed as he enters the cave fearlessly. After some time there are some terrible fighting noises to be heard. There are excruciating screams and moans, from man and bear alike. This goes on for some time. Suddenly there is a loud whimpering from the bear which slowly fades after some time. After that the russian is leaving the cave. His shirt is torn, his back full of bloody scratches, otherwise he seems okay. The natives and their chief watch him in awe.

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.

**Ghost Shit** - The kind of shit where you feel the shit come out, but there is no shit in the toilet.

**Clean Shit** - The kind of shit where you shit it out, see it in the toilet, but when you wipe your ass there is nothing on the toilet paper.

**Wet Shit** - The kind of shit where you wipe your ass so many times, and it feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper up your asshole so you will not ruin your underwear with a nasty shit stain.

**2nd Wave Shit** - This happens when you are done shitting, pulled up your pants to your waist, and you have to shit some more.

**Pop-a-Vein-in-Your-Head Shit** - The kind of shit where you strain so much to get it out that you practically have a stroke.

**Lincoln Log Shit** - The kind of shit where it is so huge you are afraid to flush it without breaking it into small pieces with the toilet brush.

**Gassy Shit** - The kind of shit so noisy, everyone in hearing range is giggling.

**The Dangling Shit** - The kind of shit that refuses to drop even though you are done shitting. You just pray that a shake or two will cut it loose.

**Drinker Shit** - The kind of shit you have in the morning after a long night of drinking; the most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet bowl.

**Corn Shit** - (Self Explanatory)

**Gee-I-Wish-I-Could-Shit Shit** - The kind of shit where you want to shit so bad, but all you can do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times.

**Spinal Tap Shit** - That is where it hurts so badly you could swear it was leaving your body sideways.

**Wet Cheeks Shit (Power Dump)** - The kind of shit that comes out so fast your ass gets splashed with water.

**Mexican Shit** - The kind of shit that smells so bad your nose hairs burn off.

**Upper Class Shit** - The kind of shit that comes out perfectly: doesn’t touch the bottom of the toilet, doesn’t smell, and defies all laws of 
shitting.

**Liquid Shit** - The kind of shit where the yellow-brownish liquid shoots out of your asshole and splashes all over the toilet bowl.

**The Never-ending Shit** - The kind of shit that you feel it come out, look into the toilet bowl, see the beginning, but never see the end.

**Five-Alarm-Fire Shit** - This is when you take a Liquid Shit and it burns you asshole so badly that you want to take a 50 foot lawn hose, put it on full 
power and shove it all the way up your ass.

**The Surprise Shit** - That is when you are not even at the toilet because you are sure that you have to fart, but oops ... a piece of shit.",This is a shit post.,24

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?” The monk graciously accepts him, feeds him dinner, and even fixes his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” 

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. 

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” 

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” 

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. 

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",The sound of the monks.,7

After a few moments a man down on the other side of the bar notices him looking downtrodden and decides to go and see what the problem is. He asks him what is wrong and listens to his story intently. At the end of the story the man tells him ""well the reason I really like this bar is that it can really lift your spirits, the winds up here are so strong that if you jump out this window over here to the right, it'll actually fly around the entire building and land you right back in this window. It's such an exhilarating feeling that anything that has went wrong in your life just instantly feel better.""  The downtrodden fellow replies ""YEAH RIGHT, that a load of bull if I've ever heard one but thanks for the laugh"" The cheery fellow tells him it's true and offers to demonstrate the phenomenon first hand to suppress any suspicion. The man agrees and they both approach the window.  The cheery man jumps out the window and sure enough a few moments later comes whizzing from the opposite side and lands perfectly back into the same window.

There were three construction workers an English and Indian and a Chinese. Everyday at 12 o'clock they'd sit down and eat their lunch. They'd been working at this construction site for a month and everyday they would have the same food. The English man had his fish and chip. The Indian man had his rice and curry and the Chinese man had his chow mein. 

One lunch time, fed up with their lunch they decided if they had the same lunch tomorrow they would jump from the top of the building. 
 
Then next day they opened their lunch box and saw they had their exact same lunch as yesterday so they all jumped from the building, leaving a note behind to say why they had decided to kill themselves. 

A funeral gathering was held for the three workers. All eyes were on the wives of the workers. 

The Englishman's wife sobbing said 

""if only he told me he wanted something different I would have made it for him.""

The Indian mans wife was crying even harder and said 
""this is all my fault I should have made him something different.""

The Chinese mans wife looked around the room and said 

""don't look at me, he used to make his own lunch"". ",Lunch,8

One day when he was young, I took Sex for a walk and he slipped out of his collar and ran away. I spent hours looking for him. A policeman came along and asked me what I was doing in an alley at midnight. I told him I was looking for Sex.

That was my first court appearance. 

dOne day I went to the town hall to get mydog registered.I told the clerk I wanted a licence for Sex. He said he would like one too. When I told him he didn't understand, that it was a dog, he said he didn't care what she looked like. Again I said he didn't understand and that I had had Sex since I was 5 years old. He said I must have been a strong boy.

When I decided to get married, I told he minister that I wanted to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the ceremony. I said that Sex had played a big part in my life and my whole lifestlye revolved around Sex. He said he didn't want to hear about it and he would not allow us to have Sex in the church. I told him all my friends and relatives coming to the church wouldenjoy having Sex there. He barred the lot of us and we had to get married in the Registry Office.

Of course, my wife and I took Sex along with us on our honeymoon and when I checked into the Motel I told the clerk we wanted and extra room for Sex. The clerk said every room was for Sex. I said you don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night, and the clerk said ""Me too.""

When my wife and I divorced, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your Honour, I had Sex before I was married,"" he replied, ""Me too.""

Well now I have been thrown in jail, been married, divorced, and had more darn troubles with that dog than I ever bargained on.

Why, just the other day when I went for my first session with my psychiatrist she asked me what seemed to be the trouble. I replied that Sex had died and left my life. it was like losing my best frient.

She said, ""You should buy a dog.""",Dog called sex,62

The guy agrees, takes his basket and goes to the market.

On his way home, he passes in front of the bar. What the hell, he thinks, if I just take one drink the wife will never know.

A dozen drinks later he realizes the night has fallen. Shit, he thinks, the wife is going to be so pissed! He takes his basket and start running toward his home. 

Because of the dark, and probably also because of the alcohol, he misses a step just in front of his door and all the snails fly out of his basket.

Shit shit shit! He thinks.

He goes flat on the floor so he can pick back up all the snails sprayed in front of him. The door opens and his wife is looking down on him. She doesn't look pleased.

""Ok, give me that 30-06. That should do it."" John buys the gun and leaves the store and the next day heads out to the ridge and scans the valley below. At 2pm a huge bear wanders into his binoculars. ""There he is! I'm gonna get him!"" John sets down the binos and picks up his rifle. He looks through the scope into the valley but doesn't see the bear. ""Hmm. Thats strange."" Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He lowers the rifle and looks behind him. He gasps in fear as he sees the bear standing over him. ""What do we have here?"" Says the bear. ""Looks like a free lunch.""

""Oh please don't eat me says John. I will do anything.""

""Well..."" The bear says, ""There is one thing. You have to let me fuck you in the ass. Then I will let you go.""

""Um...ok. Just don't eat me."" Says John.

The bear fucks him and lets him leave. John is so angry that the next day he goes back to the gun shop and tells them he needs a bigger gun and that he is going to get that damn bear.

""Give me that 7mm rifle!"" John buys the rifle and the next day goes to the ridge. Scanning with the binos he sees the bear again!

""Got you now!"" He whispers to himself.

He shoulders the rifle, looks the scope, and the bear is gone again. ""What the hell?"" He thinks. Just then a tap on his shoulder startled him. He turns around in shock to see the bear there standing over him again. 

""Back again I see."" Says the bear. ""What will it be this time? Do I eat you or fuck you?""

""Fuck me,"" John grumbles under his breathe.

So the bear fucks him again and lets him go. The next day he is so furious that he returns to the gun shop again.

""I want the biggest weapon you have here!"" John screams at the salesman. ""I'm gonna get that fucking bear!"" 

""Ok, well, its not really legal but we have this RPG in the back. Be careful though because we only have one rocket,"" says the clerk.

The next day, John returns to the ridge determined to kill the bear. He looks through the binos for the bear, locating him near some trees.

""This time you are mine!"" John whispers to himself. He grabs the RPG, aims into the valley, but no bear. Again he feels a tap on his shoulder. Hanging his head, John turns around to see the bear there again smiling at him.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little Fifi is using that seat?"" 

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!"" 

The soldier didn't say anything else. He leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The woman shrieked and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier. An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand.

Having finished his work, the geneticist took off for Maui and sent his clone to work. Within days, reports came back from his friends in the know of bizarre behavior from his doppelganger. The duplicate had cussed out the boss and his receptionist, groped all members of the research team male and female, used the Xerox to copy his genitalia, sending the results to all the company's affiliates and concluded all handshakes by forcibly pressing the other's hand against the general area of his nipple, then simulating canine-fashion copulation while saying ""nice to -meat- ya!"" The geneticist was terrified, and took the next plane back to the States. He confronted the clone in their twentieth story office, and braving a three minute uninterrupted litany of expletives, pushed the unreasonable double out the window, where he fell to his death.

The police arrived, and once the situation was explained, the geneticist laughed, disbelieving any statute covered the destruction of one's genetic clone. After interviewing all concerned parties, the geneticist was arrested. The charge?

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What can we do?

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he followed me.

His parents did everything and anything to help their son...private tutors, teacher meetings, and even asking the local Asian kid. Nothing worked.  
  
Finally, in a last ditch effort they enrolled him into a small Catholic school to see if the nun's strict curriculum would do the trick.  
  
At the end of the first day of school the boy walked in with a stern expression on his face, and walked right past the parents and went straight to his room - and quietly closed the door. For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room, only emerging long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, heading straight back to his room, working feverishly at his studies until bedtime.   

This continued for weeks until the first quarter report card came out. The parents anxiously opened the letter, and to their amazement they saw a bright red ""A"" under the subject, MATH. 

Overjoyed, they both rushed into their son's room, thrilled at the remarkable progress of their young son!

""Was it the nuns that did it?"", the father asked. The boy only shook his head and said, ""No."" ""Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The Asian kid?"", asked the mother. Again, the boy shrugged, ""No."" Both parents asked in unison, ""What was it then?""

Obama was outraged and ordered that he be fed and given some money.

'What else would you like?'

'A ticket to Russia to visit my friend.'

Obama made the arrangements and the American flew to Russia where he found that his friend was, of course, starving too. The American burst out laughing and said:

'Brother, I can give you a good piece of advice. Go to the Kremlin, sit on the ground by the gates and eat hay. Out will come Putin who will be angry to see you in such a state and give you everything you need.'

And that's what the Russian friend did. He sat down by the Kremlin gates and began eating hay. Out came Putin and saw him there.

Cracking his gum between his teeth, the Kiwi said, ""We don't. In New Zealand, we eat fresh fruit for breakfast, then we put all the peels, seeds and leftovers in containers, recycle them, transform them into jam and sell them to Fiji."" 

The Fijian then asked, ""Do you have sex in New Zealand?""

""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?"" 

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"". 

The boss says ""Just one? Our sales people average sales to 25 to 30 customers a day. This is gonna have to change very soon if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$124,548.88"".

The boss, astonished, says $124,548.88??? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Chevrolet Suburban.""

""I'm sorry but I've given my body to God"" she replies and then leaves. 

Suddenly the bus driver turns around to the guy and says ""I know a way you can get her in the sack."" The bus driver tells the guy about how the nun goes to the cemetery every night at 9 to pray, and if he dresses up and convinces her he's God, she might have sex with him.

That night at 9, the man is in the cemetery hiding behind a gravestone. When the nun approaches in the darkness he jumps out and says ""Sister, I am God and I command you to have sex with me."" She replies ""Well I mustn't deny God. However I want to remain a virgin so I will only take it up the ass."" 

The guy figures this isn't a problem and proceeds to have the best sex ever. 
After it is over he whips off his outfit and says ""Surprise, I'm the guy on the bus"" 

With that the nun turns around and says 
""Surprise, I'm the bus driver.""","[NSFW] A man is riding the bus when at a stop, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen gets on.",53

post,4xajuf,2qh72,jokes,false,1470952642,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4xajuf/priest_and_an_unknown_man/,self.jokes,,"There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.

With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:

- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",Priest and an unknown man,0

The hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would put up the drinks, and so the bet was on. They blindfolded him carefully and took him to his first animal skin. 

After feeling it for a few moments, he announced ""Bear."" Then he felt the bullet hole and declared, ""Shot with a .308 rifle.""

He was right. 

They brought him another skin, one that someone had in their car trunk. He took a bit longer this time and then said, ""Elk, Shot with a 7mm Mag rifle. 

He was right again. 

Through the night, he proved his skills again and again, every time against a round of drinks. Finally he staggered home, drunk out of his mind,and went to sleep. 

The next morning he got up and saw in the mirror that he had one hell of a shiner. He said to his wife, 

""I know I was drunk last night, but not drunk enough to get in a fight and not remember it. Where did I get this blackeye?""

“Oh, You don’t want to know” says the man.

“Oh, I most definitely want to know”, replies the barman.

“Believe me, you really don’t want to know”, repeats the man. 

“How about this…. the next two rounds of drinks are on the house, if you tell me where in hell you found this 10"" pianist!” 

The man thinks for a second and says….: “I’ll tell you under one condition, you take full responsibility for whatever happens next !?” 

‘Deal!’ replies the barman. 

“Ok, here is the story. One day I found this strange old magic ring, and if you rub it long enough a very old genie comes out and grants you a wish. But…..”

The intrigued barman doesn’t even give the man a chance to finish his story, and starts begging him to give him a go on the ring… after some back and forth they agree on a month of free drinks on the house.

“But remember, I am not responsible for anything that happens next” reminds him the man.

He hands him the ring and the barman begins rubbing it. After 30 seconds or so, a very old genie appears from within a purple cloud of fog. 

“Master! You have released me and I shall grant you a wish”, says the old genie in hoarse voice.

The barman thinks for a moment, and eventually decides: “I would like to have ten million bucks!”

“Your wish is my command” says the old genie with his hoarse voice.

In less than three second, millions of ducks appear from nowhere, a cloud of feathers fill the air, bottles fall and break on the floor, and you can barely breath or move. Basically in minutes the bar is destroyed, by a flock of ten million ducks.

“What is wrong with this genie!!??” screams the barman in panic. “I have asked for ten million BUCKS, not for ten million DUCKS !!”

“Well, I tried to warn you…"" shouts the man through the feathers. ""And by the way, how did you think exactly, I have ended up with a 10” PIANIST in my pocket?”
