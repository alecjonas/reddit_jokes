""But how do I know if the people around me are really intelligent?""

The Queen took a sip of champagne.

""Oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle, watch""

The Queen pushed a button on her intercom.

""Please send Tony Blair in here, would you?""

Tony Blair walked into the room and said, 

""Yes, your Majesty?""

The Queen smiled and said, 

""Answer me this please Tony. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""

Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answered, 
""That would be me.""

""Yes! Very good."" said the Queen.

Obama went back home to ask Joe Biden the same question. 
""Joe, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister.
Who is it?"" 

""I'm not sure,"" said Biden, ""let me get back to you on that one."" 
He went to his advisers and asked everyone, but none could give him an answer. Frustrated, Biden went to work out in congressional gym and saw Paul Ryan there. Biden went up to him and asked, 

""Hey Paul, see if you can answer this question. Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""
Paul Ryan answered, 
""That's easy, it's me!""
Biden smiled, and said, 
""Good answer Paul!"" 
Biden then, went back to speak with President Obama.

""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's Paul Ryan!""

Obama got up, stomped over to Biden, and angrily yelled into his face,

post,438szp,2qh72,jokes,false,1454074570,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/438szp/shlomo_is_upset/,self.jokes,,"he's at services, practically tearing at his clothes in anguish, when the rabbi (noticing his pain) comes to him after and says ""Shlomo, everything is okay?""

With tears in his eyes, Shlomo turns to the rabbi and says ""Rebbe, you remember when my son Benjamin went to the holy land?"" ""Oh yes!"" says the rabbi. Then his face fell. ""Something happen to him? Is he okay?""

""No, rabbi, no. But he comes back from the trip, and he tells me he is a Christian now!""

The rabbi puts his arm around him. ""This is a terrible thing, Shlomo. But, I.. I hate aspersions to be casting here, but there are questions I must ask, nu? Have you been keeping bacon in your fridge, or had shrimp at a party? Perhaps not quite tithing everything from your business?""

Shlomo looks back at the rabbi, hurt. ""I would do no such thing, and neither would his dear mother."" ""I know, I know"" said the rabbi quickly, patting his arm. ""But there are questions I must be asking. It doesn't just happen that a good Jewish boy suddenly becomes a Christian. Especially in the Holy Land! Let us go to the head rabbi.""

So together they go and explain the whole business to the head rabbi, an ancient man known for his wisdom and learning. The man asks them both ""Is there some rule you broke perhaps? Driving somewhere on a Saturday? Did you let him get a tattoo?"" and the two men swear this is not the case and tear their clothes. The head rabbi says ""this is a most serious case. I know of a man in Jersualem, a great great man who can speak directly to... (pointing upwards) but will only do so if absolutely necessary and all other avenues have been explored, which is why these questions I am asking. Shlomo, it will go very very badly for you if you are lying in any way, this is the only reason I am being like this.""

So they all go off to Jerusalem to meet with the special, special rabbi. He solemnly starts asking the questions, and they say ""look, the joke is already going on too long here, let's move to the punchline"" so the rabbi goes ""OK OK OK, you understand the questions I must be asking!"" and they all yell ""WE'VE DONE ALL THAT!""

So he puts on his special robes, lights the incense, does all the requisite things and enters the inner tabernacle and throws his hands outwards, calling out to God. 

""I come to you today on behalf of our friend Shlomo, who is in terrible pain. His son came here, to the Holy Land, and became a Christian. The pain to his poor mother! Tell us, please, what for must we be doing?""

And this voice comes down from above. ""**Me**, you are asking? Oy, vey.....""

1. When computing, whatever happens, behave as though you meant it to happen. 
2. When you get to the point where you really understand your computer, it's probably obsolete. 
3. The first place to look for information is in the section of the manual where you least expect to find it. 
4. When the going gets tough, upgrade. 
5. For every action, there is an equal and opposite malfunction.
6. To err is human.. to blame your computer for your mistakes is even more human, it is downright natural. 
7. He who laughs last probably made a back-up. 
8. If at first you do not succeed, blame your computer. 
9. A complex system that does not work is invariably found to have evolved from a simpler system that worked just fine. 
10. The number one cause of computer problems is computer solutions. 
11. A computer program will always do what you tell it to do, but rarely what you want to do.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays 
right-handed, and narrowly beats all three of them.
The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play,they can't hold a grudge.
This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?"" 
The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,"" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth. ""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""
The guys think this is hysterical. 
Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?"" She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",The lady golfer,187

Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.

'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'

A woman takes a lover home during the day while her husband is at work.

Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them, and hides in the bedroom closet. Then the woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.

The little boy says, 'Dark in here.'

The man says, 'Yes, it is.'

Boy - 'I have a golf ball.' 

Man - 'That's nice.' 

Boy - 'Want to buy it?' 

Man - 'No, thanks.' 

Boy - 'My dad's outside.' 

Man - 'OK, how much?' 

Boy - '$250' 

A few weeks later, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.

Boy - 'Dark in here.' 

Man - 'Yes, it is.' 

Boy - 'I have sand wedge.

'The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy, 'How much?' 

Boy - '$750' 

Man - 'Sold.' 

A few days later, the boy’s father says to the boy, 'Grab your sand wedge and golf ball, let's go outside and have some short game practice.

Boy - 'I can't. I sold my ball and sand wedge, dad.' 

Father - 'What! How much did you sell them for?'

Boy - '$1,000.' 

Father - 'That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That is far more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church so that you can confess.' 

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy go into the confession booth. 

The boy says, 'Dark in here.' 

The priest says, 'Don't start that shit with me again. You're in my closet now!'",The Golf Ball and the Sand Wedge,2

Dear Abby
My husband hasn't worked in 14 years. All he does is get dressed in the morning and hop in his fancy car to visit his cronies. He's cheated on me many times with young girls who could be his grand daughters. I know because he brags about it. He smokes fancy cigars and drinks expensive Champagne day and night. We sleep in separate beds because he`s always telling me he knows I`m a lesbian and my varicose veins and ugly face turn him off! Should I clobber him with my frying pan, or should I leave him Abby?
Your advice will be appreciated,
Mad as Hell

 
Dear Mad as Hell,
You don`t have to take that kind of treatment from any man. I suggest you pack your bags and move out a.s.a.p.! Don`t resort to clobbering him with the frying pan, and try to act like a lady!
Remember ....... you`re running for President of the United States, so try acting like it!

""I don't understand,"" said Lil Jon. ""Why did you install this light bulb?""

""This is a special light bulb!"" The electrician replied enthusiastically. ""In order to help you live a healthier lifestyle, the bulb will become dimmer the more you drink. When it gets too dark to see, you know it's time to call it a night.""

Lil Jon was astounded.

""I can't wait to try it out!"" he said. So that night, Lil Jon had a party with all his closest family and friends. They laughed and drank and danced the evening away.

Around 11:30 PM, the party guests became tired and some had even begun to go home. But Lil' Jon was not satisfied.

If you don't, 1) Stop living under a rock and 2) Search it up. Anyways, I stopped into one store to buy a backpack. The man who was selling it was Chinese. I asked him ""What's the price?"" he gladly replied in the stereotypical Chinese accent: ""THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS!"". I wasn't going to spend 35 dollars on a backpack. So I asked for a discount. Now, you see, Chinese people won't tell you 'no'. They'll tell you the longest 'no' you've ever heard in your entire life. ""Nooooooooooo"" he said. ""Cmon, just a little discount, please?"" I said. He talked to his wife on the phone. ""TONG LAO TONG LAO!"" He said. He smiled at me and said: ""Okay, you look like nice guy. I give you a discount:$34.50."". ""That's 50 cents."" I said. The man replied with anxious enthusiasm ""50 cent a lot of money! You save 50 here you go somewhere else and you save 50! Now you have a dollar! You go to the dollar store and you buy something with your dollar!"". I say: ""You know, I'm fine. Nice meeting you."" Now he starts telling me stuff that has nothing to do with anything. He says ""Hey! Be a man! You change your mind, you come here tomorrow you ask for discount I say 'NOOO'! I close down tomorrow! Be a man!"". He starts becoming my money manager now. ""This is my financial plan for you..."" he says ""You have the advantage! Nobody knows about the discount! Be a man and grab the discount! You'll save 50 cents! 50 CENT!"". So I walk away, and say ""Um, thanks anyway, bye."". As I walk away, I turn back. I see the Chinese man shouting at me. Soon after, he sticks his pinky at me.

""What makes you think that?"" replies his friend.

""Every time I come her underwear is strewn about the living room floor.""

""My son tends to leave his underwear on the floor as well...""

""Also, I found an open condom wrapper on our floor and it wasn't the brand I use.""

""My son tends to leave his candy wrappers on the floor...""

This makes the man paranoid that his own friend's son may be doing his wife. He tells his friend to follow him home to see if he was right or not. They approached the front of the house and the man says:

""I told my wife I'd be out all night. If she's cheating on me, she'll surely have the man she's seeing over tonight.""

""I told my son id be out all night as well."" Replied the friend.

The man stormed into his house in a rage and ran up to the bedroom and opened the door swiftly. Sure enough, there was the man's wife...but dead. He let out a horrifying scream and rushed to her side. As he held her dead body in his arms, his friend's son emerged from behind the curtains with a glock and shot the man in the head. The man fell to the ground, instantly dead. The son proceed to go downstairs and out the front door to hunt his father down. He fired shots into the bushes where his father was hiding. One caught him in the leg, and he screamed in agony. His son approached him and said one last thing before he put a bullet in his own father's brain:

post,42x6pk,2qh72,jokes,false,1453896447,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/42x6pk/singing_blowjob_nsfw/,self.jokes,,"One of my friends was a sailor in the navy many moons ago. He was out on deployment for long periods of time, and being a ship without women, he was naturally frisky.

They arrived at an island to resupply and the crew were given leave - so he makes his way to the nearest tavern and enquires of the barmaid

'Where can I find a brothel around here?'

To which the barmaid replies

""I'm afraid you won't find any such establishment around here. Missionaries came through several years back and we've all but converted.""

He left the bar and began aimlessly wandering around the island. As night fell he decided to climb one last hill before heading back to the ship. As he reached the crest of the hill, he noticed a shack all alone with a sign reading:

""Singing blowjobs: $5""

Excitedly he knocks on the door. The door opens and a little old lady looks up at him. He recoils a little and thinks to himself that maybe this wasn't such a good idea. The old lady grins and asks

""Ooooh. Here for the singing blowjob are we?"".

'N-no. I have the wrong place, sorry' he stammers.

""Ooooh no, you'll be wanting the blowjob. Come on in. Come on"", she says.

He hands her the $5 and enters the shack. The door closes to veritable darkness and he unzips his fly. The singing begins and the lady goes to work to a resounding crescendo. Baffled by how such a thing is possible he asks

'How were you able to do that?!'

""Old family secret"" she laughs, half speaking to herself.

Relieved but curious, he leaves and returns the next evening. He knocks on the door and the old woman answers

""Back again are we? I expect you'll be after the singing blowjob!"" she enquires.

'Yes, yes. Here is the $5' he says, handing the money over and closing the door behind him. The singing begins and an amazing blowjob follows. He enquires again how such a thing is possible, only to be met with the same reply.

The next day the ship leaves port and they sail out on their next mission. He tells all his friends of the singing blowjob, to which most of them laugh and mock him. He remains adamant it was real and that he'd find out the secret.

Years pass and they chance upon the same island again. The ship docks and he runs to the hilltop to find the shack standing there, with the same sign.

He knocks on the door and the old woman answers again. She looks up at him, and then realisation lights up in her eyes

""Ooooh! I remember you. You'll be wanting the singing blowjob! Come in, come in!"", she says.

'No, I just want to know how you do it!' he demands.

""Family secret, can't tell. Can't tell"" she replies, smiling and laughing to herself.

'Alright, alright. Here is your money' he says, determined to uncover the truth. He hands her the money and heads inside the dark shack. The singing begins and he tries to focus on his surroundings, looking for a radio or television -- anything which might produce the sound. Before long he is lost in the ecstasy and forgets all about looking. The woman finishes the job, and he leaves.

Frustrated and adamant to uncover the truth, he decides to bring a torch with him the following evening to finally get to the bottom of the family secret.

The following evening he rushes up the hill with a torch in his back pocket. Knocking on the door, he is received by the old woman again

""Back again are we? The singing blowjob it will be?"" she grins.

'Fine. Yes. Here is your money' he says, pushing the money at her and closing the door behind him. The singing begins and the woman goes to work. For a moment he nearly loses himself to the feeling and forgets to look around.

Regaining his senses, he fumbles in his back pocket and pulls the torch out. Flicking it on, he casts it down to the table in front of him and the first thing he sees - a glass eyeball.",Singing blowjob (NSFW),45

Two hikers have just finished a 5 mile trek up a mountain. They're exhausted and near starving by the time they reach the top, so they decide to set up camp and start cooking themselves a few burgers to eat.


While one hiker is flipping the burgers, the other notices a shaggy-haired individual emerge from the trees and start to walk over. The two hikers, alarmed by his distraught appearance, watch him as he approaches. 


As it turns out, the man has been lost up on top of the mountain for weeks. Surviving off berries, small streams, and whatever odd edible things he can find. So, naturally, this man asks the two hikers' for one of their burgers. 


The two hikers look at each other, look back at the shaggy mountain man, and refuse. They have been hiking for hours without food, you see, and are very hungry. 


The shaggy mountain man is desperate, and refuses to take no for an answer. So he comes up with this. He offers the two hikers to play a game for one of the burgers. If he wins, he gets one of the delicious burgers. If he loses, he walks away and they never see him again. The game is 20 Questions. 


The two hikers turn to the side to discuss it. 

""Okay, let's just come up with something this guy will never guess in a million years.""

""Yeah fine, but like what?""

""How about... moose cock?""

""Wow, good for you. Yeah okay. Lets do it.""


So the turn hikers go back to the shaggy mountain man and say they are ready to play the game.

""Alright fellas. First rule of 20 Questions,"" the mountain man asks, ""Can you eat it?""

The two hikers look at each other in amusement. ""Uhh, yeah, yeah, I guess you can eat it,"" says one of the hikers.

The mountain man takes a big deep breathe and pauses for some time. Then finally, in one exhausted breathe, he replies, .....

 ""Is it moose cock?!""

The shaggy mountain then enjoyed his juicy burger while the two hikers stood in disbelief.

And that, my friends, is the moose cock joke.

SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!

BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period.

JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.

HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road?

GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.

DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?

BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.

AL GORE: I invented the chicken.... and the road.

JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.

AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?

DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.

OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.

ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.

NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.

PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.

MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.

DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.

GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

DONALD TRUMP: We should build a wall so the chicken can't cross the road.

BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?

COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",Why did the chicken cross the road?,221

40 minutes later, the Irishman who left returned and said, ""Hey Yank, is yer bet still on?"" 
""Sure"" said the American, ""20 pints in 30 minutes for a bet of $5,000 .""
""Grand, "" replied the Irishman, ""so pour the pints and start the clock."" 

It was very close but the last drop was consumed with 2 seconds to spare.

OK Yank, pay up."" said the Irishman.

""I'm happy to pay, here's your money"" said the American. ""But tell me, when I first offered the wager, I saw you leave. Where did you go?'
