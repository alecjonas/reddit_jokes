The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor; she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.

The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.

She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.

Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.

The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter.

He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you warned me and I didn't listen to you.""

""What do you mean?"" asked his wife.

""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God and some Vaseline, I think I got most of them back in.""",A couple had been happily married for years.,16

The letter read:

Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had £100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension cheque.
Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner.
Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.
Can you please help me?
Sincerely,
Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few pounds. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.

The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.

It read:

Dear God, 
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

By the way, there was £4 missing.

The Wallawallas could never create a treasure to rival the throne, so they decided to steal it.  But the Chief of the Ubangis learned of their plot, and decided to hide the throne on the second floor of his grass mansion, and to surround the mansion with guards.

They dropped it from the highest cliffs, and crushed it in the deepest oceans.

They tried igniting in it the sunniest of locations, and in the darkest of crevasses.

They subject it to the hottest temperatures they could muster, both natural and manmade.

And yet, the material was unwavering, refusing to yield to any force…until a scientist suggested the impossible.

“What if it only explodes when it’s really cold?”

Out they set to test the theory. Sure enough, as the temperature grew ever colder, the element began to show signs of degradation. Excitedly, they began pushing the temperatures even further into the freezing zone. As the temperatures reached nearer and nearer to 0 Kelvin (absolute cold), the element continued to increasingly react.

Finally, when the temperature reached approximately that of absolute zero, there was a blinding flash as the element exploded before their eyes, leaving a gaping hole on the laboratory bench.

As the applause from the team of scientists began to die down, relieved of finally solving the mystery, one of the senior scientists boldly asked, “so what do we name this newfound element?”.

Amongst the thought that ensued, one of the younger scientists was quick to make a suggestion...

The doctor replied, ""Your penis is very, very large. The weight of your penis is causing a strain on your larynx, and this results in your stuttering. The only solution to this is to perform a penis transplant."" 

The man was really tired of his stuttering, so he agreed to a transplant. Several days later the doctor called the man up and informed him that they have found a suitable donor. The transplant operation was successfully performed and the man could speak without any stutter.

At first he was happy, but after a while he began to miss his large penis, and how the girls used to love it. 

He finally went back to his doctor and said, ""Doctor, I am grateful for the opportunity you have
given me to speak without a stutter, but I miss my old penis. Please find the transplant donor and tell him that we have to exchange penises back.""

The doctor shook his head and replied, ""Tha...thaaa...that's im... immm... imm... po.. po.. pooo.. impossible!""","A man had a bad case of stuttering.

""Negative, ma'am. Just serious by nature.""

The young lady, tiring of trying to start up a conversation, said, ""You know, you should lighten up. Relax and enjoy yourself.""

The Sergeant Major just stared at her in his serious manner.

Finally the young lady said, ""You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last time you had sex?

""1955, ma'am""

""Well, there you are. No wonder you're so serious. You really need to chill out! I mean, no sex since 1955!"" She took his hand and led him to a private room where she proceeded to ""relax"" him.

Afterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and said, ""Wow, you sure didn't forget much since 1955.""

Sure enough, she looks over at the coffin and while the top half was open for viewing, the bottom half was propped open by a few inches.

The director continues ""we hoped the pressure from the lid would have helped it go down, but it's pretty solid. Our only final option is to cut it off and tuck it in beside him. Can we have your permission to do so?""

Mindy thought for a second, she appeared a little baffled, but finally replied ""of course, if it needs to be cut off, then go ahead and do so. But dont just leave it beside him, shove it up his ass"" now the director had a shocked look so Mindy continued ""trust me, it will be fine""

So while some of the family said a few final words, the director took Bob away for the procedure and returned shortly after with one side open and the other side fully closed.

Mindy approached Bob to say her final goodbye. As she got close she noticed some tears were running down his face. She pulled out a tissue, wiped his tears away, leaned in and whispered in his ear ""See, I told you it hurts""",NSFW semi dark humor,22

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""  Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""","When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.",12

""Ok, I'll bite.""  

True to the waiters word, they were delicious, so delicious the tourist resolved to come back the next day for more.  On his return on the morrow, he ordered the cojones only to be served some pathetic little ovoids about an inch and a half long.  

""Waiter! Oh, waiter!""  

The waiter comes over and the man complains ""Why are these so small? Yesterday I had the same dish and they were a good 4 or 5 inches across?""

""Where you wanna go?"" said Kyle.

""Hooters."" said Irish.

""Why Hooters?"" said Kyle.

""They have those servers with the beautiful bosoms, the tight shorts and the gorgeous legs, and they have Monster energy drinks."" said Irish.

""You're on."" said Kyle.

He gave very specific instructions, only a quarter of a spoon of sugar and no milk.

So there's this foldable table set up, with foam cups, napkins, hot water boilers, tea bags, etc. You know what I'm talking about.

There were many people before me, so the whole table was a mess. Anyways, I expertly poured hot water from the tank, after inserting the tea bag. 

However, there was only 1 plastic spoon for pouring in sugar... and it was covered in drops of milk. I figured, no big deal, only a small minuscule amount of milk... 

And so poured the quarter of a spoon of sugar, with traces of milk, into the tea.

However, the tea turned into this gray color, like dirty dish water. 

I went back to our table and gave him his cup of tea. He looked at me disgusted and confused, and asked what is that. 

And right on the spot, I replied, ""Oh, it's earl gray tea"". 

The answer seemed to satisfy him and he drank away.",So this is a true story,0

So the American, frustrated now, says “ I’ll have to play you once more”. Micilín replies once again “no bother, but I might be half an hour late.” The American, bewildered, goes “I have to ask, how do you decide whether you’ll play right handed or left handed?”. “Well”, Micilín replies,”in the morning I look at the wife.

“How?” asks the man.

So the man does as he is told and he takes Marvin across all the continents and countries. The young snake see the Alps, and the Great Barrier Reef, and the UN headquarters and all that is beautiful and worth protecting.

His wife thinks he's pushing himself too hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club. The doorman at the club greets them and says:

""Hey, Vern! How ya doin'?""

His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before.

""Oh no,"" says Vern. ""He's in my bowling league.""

When they are seated, a waitress asks Vern If he'd like his usual and brings over a Budweiser. His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says:

""How did she know that you drink Budweiser?""

""I recognize her, she's the waitress from the golf club. I always have a Bud at the end of the front nine, honey.""

A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Vern, starts to rub herself all over him and says:

""Hi, Vern. Want your usual table dance, big boy?""

Vern's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Vern follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. Vern tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it.

Once a week he brings me a huge bouquet of flowers, he’s constantly bringing me out to restaurants to eat, if I so much as hint that I want something the next morning it’s on my doorstep.”


“That’s very nice about your Freddie”, says Gertrude. “But with all due respect, when I think about the way my Sammy takes care of me, it just can’t compare. Every morning as soon as I wake up he greets me with bacon and freshly brewed coffee. Every lunch he comes over and cooks me a gourmet lunch, and every supper he brings me to his house for supper, he truly treats me like a queen.”

 “WELL!” Says Barbara “I don’t want to make any of you feel bad or anything, but wait until you hear about my Harry, twice a week he pays someone $200 an hour just so he can lie on their couch and talk to them, and who do you think he speaks about at those prices? Asks Barbara with a big excited double chin smile, “I’ll tell you who he speaks about! ALL HE SPEAKS ABOUT IS ME!”",Three old ladies are sitting around a table playing bridge and bragging about their sons...,8

After no one answered for a few minutes, he opened the door to see broken glass everywhere, a lamp lying on the ground, and a huge fat Arabian man wearing a turban sitting on the couch. 

Dylan asked, ""Who are you?""

 The fat man replied, ""I am a genie you have freed from that lamp."" 

Dylan questioned, ""Oh man, do I get three wishes?"" 

The genie replied, ""Since you freed me by accident you only get two and I get one.""

 Dylan thought about it and realized what he wanted, ""I want to be the best golfer ever.""

 The surprised genie said, ""You sure? Most people wish for money, but okay. Now your wife gets one wish."" 

Dylan brought over his wife who wished right away, ""I want a million dollars every week of my life.""

 The genie said, ""Granted. And now for my wish, I have been cramped up in that lamp for many years so its been a while since I've been with a woman. I want one day of wild, crazy sex with your wife, Dylan.""

 Dylan said, ""No way!"" 

The genie replied, ""Not even for a million dollars a week?"" 

Dylan turned to his wife, who said, ""I guess for all that, I should. Well, not until Dylan leaves.""

 Dylan said, ""Okay, have fun, I guess,"" and left. 

Dylan's wife then proceeded to have wild sex for the rest of the day with the genie. When they were finished, the genie asked how old her husband was. 

She said, ""Forty-five."" 

The Genie laughed and said, ""Isn't he a little old to be believing in genies?""",Dylan was practicing his golf swing in his front yard when he swung a little too hard and sent the ball through his neighbors window.,1944
