There are 4 test questions. Scroll to the end. Don't miss one.

Giraffe Test 1. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator? Stop and think about it and decide on your answer before you scroll down. The correct answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe, and close the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.

Elephant Test 2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator? Did you say, Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the refrigerator? Wrong Answer. Correct Answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your previous actions.

Lion Test 3. The Lion King is hosting an Animal Conference. All the animals attend ... except one. Which animal does not attend? Correct Answer: The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator. You just put him in there. This tests your memory.

Okay, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true abilities.

Crocodile Test 4 There is a river you must cross but it is used by crocodiles, and you do not have a boat. How do you manage that task? Correct Answer: You jump into the river and swim across. Haven't you been lis-ten-ing? All the crocodiles are attending the Animal Conference. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.

""Dear Ronald J. Kse,

This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.

Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse,  
After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse",A Farmer gets a Letter from his Neighbors,364

""Yessir.""

""If you have a lawn, you certainly have a house, no?""

""Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you have a house, with a lawn and a lawnmower, you must have a family with whom you reside?""

required a perfect first shot over a large pond and onto a tiny green.  There
were sand traps on the other three sides of the green, and a small road 50
feet beyond it.  Harry went first.  He carefully addressed the ball and hit
a good shot that landed just on the edge of the green, narrowly avoiding the
pond.  Just as Fred addressed his ball, he looked up and noticed a funeral
procession along the road just behind the green.  Fred put down his club,
took his hat off, and waited for the entire procession to pass.  As soon as
the cars were gone he put his hat back on and started addressing the ball
again.  Harry said, ""Damn, Fred.  That was a really nice thing you did,
waiting for the funeral to pass like that.""

Fred finished his swing, making perfect contact with the ball.  It
was an excellent shot that landed 7 feet from the hole.  ""It's the least I
could do,"" he said, smiling at his shot, ""We were married for 22 years,

They go back to her apartment and things get steamy. While they're getting naked she says to him, ""Can you do something for me, please?""

""Anything,"" he says.

""Will you take a dump on my chest?"" she inquires.

He is a bit taken aback and disgusted, but he's drunk enough that it seems like a reasonable request. So he takes a dump on her chest, and they have sex. It turns out to be the best sex he's ever had.

Before he leaves she asks, ""Will I ever see you again?""

He replies in the affirmative.

The man later shares his experience with a friend. The friend tells him that he's onto a winner and tells him that the next time he should eat lots of laxatives beforehand.

The man takes a whole lot of laxatives then meets up with the woman again. They do the deed again, he takes a dump on her chest. This time there's more shit, it's softer and the sex is even better. The woman asks to see him again.

He goes back to his friend and tells him the good news. The friend suggests that next time he should eat a lot of curry the night before.

The night before he meets up with the woman again he goes to an Indian restaurant and eats a chicken vindaloo. The sex the next day after he takes a dump on her chest is phenomenal. Once again they agree to meet again.

The next time the man decides to go all out and eat two curries the night before and also eat a whole box of laxatives. After all, the looser his stools, the better the sex.

On his way to have sex with the woman, he has an enormous urge to take a shit. He can't make it to her apartment. He stops at a petrol station toilet and empties his bowels. The toilet is splattered with a pile of shit that comes half a foot above the water. It takes numerous flushes to get rid of it.

When he gets to the woman's apartment, things go as before. They get hot and steamy, she takes off her clothes, and it's time for him to take a dump on her chest. Not wanting to disappoint her, he gives it a try. But instead of the previous times when he shat large volumes, he is only able to squeeze out a small pebble.

She sits up in bed and glares at him. Angrily she demands, ""Are you seeing someone else?""",Chicken vindaloo and laxatives,0

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! 
We'll take care of the rest!!!",Trump on Day 1,40

One year Dave and Shae went to the fair, and Dave said,

'Shae, I'm 85 years old. If I don't ride that helicopter, I might never get another chance'

To this, Shae replied,

""Dave that helicopter ride is hundred bucks, and hundred bucks is hundred bucks'

The pilot overheard the couple and said,

'Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and don't say a word I won't charge you a penny! But if you say one word it's hundred dollars.'

Dave and Shae agreed and up they went.

The pilot did all kinds of fancy manoeuvres, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word...

When they landed, the pilot turned to Dave and said,

'By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm impressed!'

One day, a very rich merchant who was an expert connoisseur heard of the nation's famous Ghee and stopped by the king's castle to check out their finest Ghee. Alas, it wasn't good enough for his tastes, so he told the king ""Sire, I'm afraid your Ghee simply doesn't meet my...... unique standards. Perhaps you could find something more........ mindblowing for me, maybe? If you do, I have a rather handsome sum at my disposal as payment for your wares. Alas, I can't linger any longer for I have other countries more needing of my inquiry, so farewell, sire. May our paths cross again."" Thus, the merchant went on his way.

Eager to please the merchant's demands, the king and his men researched on creating a new, ""mindblowing"" Ghee that will meet the merchant's tastes. After a couple of months, they successfully developed a kind of Ghee infused with weed. ""This will be sure to satisfy him,"" said the King. Thus, he sent a few of his men to search for the merchant to send words of his success.
In a nearby country, one of the king's men found the rich merchant. ""Excuse me, sir, I have a rather.... ""mindblowing"" product that you might be interested in,"" he said. Curious, the merchant had a taste of the weed-infused Ghee. Within a few minutes, the merchant began to experience a very ""mindblowing"" feeling. Unable to resist, the king's man had a few tastes as well.

""Holy shi- this is simply amazing! Tell me, where can I get more of this wonderful product?""

""In mah Ghee nation!""",A king founded a country.,3

Doctor: ""Dude, I'm a doctor, I've seen all kinds of things. There's no way I'd laugh at one of my patients.""

Guy: ""You're gonna laugh at it. I know it.""

The doctor insists he won't and after some convincing the guy agrees to show him the swollen testicle. He unzips, reaches in with one hand, then the other, grabs it and begins pulling it out. It's so large and heavy that even with both hands he struggles to put it on the table.  The doctor takes one look at this misshapen, lumpy, mess and bursts out laughing.

He orders his drink and takes a seat next to some others.  After the laughter dies down, someone yells out, “ number 41” which is followed by a round of laughs. He looks around with a small smirk, but he’s a little confused. Again someone shouts out “number 119” which is followed again by a rousing laugh. So he ask his neighbor, “whats going on here?” and his neighbor replies “r/jokes has so many repost that we know all the jokes by heart and can just refer to them by their numbers now”. 
So the new Redditor opens up r/jokes on his phone and scrolls through all the post to find a good one to shout out. Once he does, he waits for the latest round of laughter to die down, and he yells out “number 699!” 

He waits… but no one laughs… just a couple polite chuckles. 

Then after a brief pause someone yells out, “ Number 442!” which is followed by a huge wave a laughter. 
The new Redditor grabs his phone and scrolls through to find a really great joke, one with a bunch of up votes. They’ll have to laugh. He waits for another lull then shouts out,” number 147!”

Nothing. 

The bar becomes awkwardly silent and after a moment someone yells out “599!” which is followed by another full bellied laugh. 
This time he grabs his phone, and scrolls through all the top votes to find the one joke that has been reposted a thousand times, and upvoted to the top every time. He memorizes the number and readies himself for the next lull. When it comes he yells “Number 21!”

Again. Nothing. 

Frustrated, he leans over to his neighbor and asks, “What’s the deal? All of those jokes had a bunch of upvotes and were reposted a thousand times” to which his neighbor replies, “Well, I guess some can tell ‘um and some can’t”.",A new Redditor joins a large group at an r/jokes meet up.,0

So she's walking down the street and decides to go into a pet store in search of a suitable present. After looking around for a few minutes she goes up to the counter and asks the clerk, 

""Do you have any exotic pets? Something unusual? My wedding anniversary is coming up, but my husband already has everything he's ever wanted"" the store clerk immediately says,

""Don't worry. I think I've got just what your looking for."" the clerk leads her into a small back room in the middle of which stood a cage atop a wooden stool.

In the middle of the the cage there was a little poofy fur ball. The wife looks to the clerk and asks, 

""Umm.... What is that supposed to be?"" the clerk answers, 

""it's a wooly miner!""
""wooly miner? What's a wooly miner!?""
""well here, I'll show you."" the clerk open the cage, grabs the wooly miner, and sets it down on the wooden stool and commands it, ""wooly miner, wooly miner this stool!“ the wooly miner instantly begins mauling the stool, and within 10 seconds it is reduced to a pile of saw dust.

The wife is amazed and immediately agrees to purchase the wooly miner at an insanely high price.

A few days later on their anniversary when the wife gives her husband the gift she tells him, 

""This year's gift is one of a kind. Unlike anything you've ever seen."" her husband is ecstatic seeing as its been years since he got a unique gift. He opens up the rather large box only to see a little poof ball in the center of a cage. Disappointed he says, 

""This is what you got me?! What the hell is this!?"" the wife perks up, 

""Well, it's a wooly miner!"" the husband opens the cage, grabs the wooly miner, and yells, ""Wooly miner!? Wooly Miner my ass!""",The wooly miner,6

They had been high school sweethearts, married young, and lived together for 70 years until the day he died. She was a housewife her whole life and never even dated anyone else, so she moved into an assisted living facility when her husband passed. She never drank, never did drugs, never gambled, never cheated, but her one vice was smoking.

The only facility she could afford on her limited income was strictly non-smoking. She had smoked as long as she could remember, and wasn't about to stop now. Whenever she wanted a cigarette, she would just have to go outside to smoke. Luckily there was one other resident there who also smoked, so they quickly became friends.

One day this little old lady is outside smoking a cigarette with her friend. Suddenly it starts to rain. Her cigarette goes out, but her friend pulls something from a pocket and uses it to cover her cigarette. She's able to continue smoking without her cigarette going out.

""Well that's clever, it's like a little raincoat. What do you call it?"" asked the little old lady.

""It's called a condom. I get them from the drug store.""

The following day the little old lady went to the drug store. She marched right up to the counter and said, ""Sir, I'd like to buy some condoms.""

The tall pharmacist smiled down on her. ""Well ma'am, we have many sizes and styles. Which kind would you like?""

This little old lady hadn't considered the question before. She looked puzzled for a moment before saying, ""I don't really care as long as it's big enough to fit a Camel.""",This little old lady...,81

My pal Vidya was a really nice guy. His politics erred on the side of backwards from time to time, sure, and he had this really short, hair-trigger temper. But he was mostly a chill dude. He used to throw video game and pizza parties at his house.

The parties were your standard affair; clean up after yourself, don't be a dick, and so on. There was just one rule at all of Vidya's parties: *Don't*, under *any* circumstances, touch his stereo. You could destroy all of his Mom's fine china for what he cared - but you *didn't* fuck with Vidya's playlists. Vidya tended to record his music on tape (his Dad taught him how to do it and he just never got out of the habit), and the hours he spent putting into those tapes was time he cherished. If the tape was even *slightly* distorted it would set off Vidya's temper. So we all agreed that no matter how shitty the music was, we'd let it play. It was a rule we all agreed to abide by.

Anyway, most of these parties went off without a hitch, but all that changed one day when the Alpha Bitches attacked. For some reason the popular girls at school invited themselves along to Vidya's party, presumably to dig up dirt on him so they could titter about him around the lunch table. I told Vidya what the girls were planning and he shrugged. ""Let 'em have their fun, just as long as they don't touch my fucking stereo."" As I say, a chill dude through and through.

So the day of the party comes and the Alpha Bitches turn up. The party is going pretty well and it's about two hours in when I start noticing one of the girls complaining about the ""shitty music"". Oh God, I think, here we go. The girl's parents were immigrants and they'd named her in their native language after the celestial body she was born under, but that was hard to remember, so she just told everyone her name was ""Stella"" or ""Estrella"" or something to that effect. She seemed to change her name week for week.

Anyway, Stella reaches into her bag and pulls out the latest Taylor Swift album. Now, I like Taylor Swift, but Vidya can't stand her, and he has given explicit instructions to everyone not to touch the hi-fi. The girls are talking amongst themselves about replacing the music surreptitiously. ""He'll never notice,"" says one. ""What's he gonna do about it?"" giggles another. Vidya isn't a very heavy-set guy but you'd be surprised how he can use his body weight. He does that whole putting all his body weight into throwing punches deal.

Naturally, I warn the girls not to do it. They tell me to fuck off, typically, and go over to the stereo. Estrella or whatever the fuck her name is ejects the tape and is just putting the CD into the CD changer when a force of fucking nature knocks her across the room. With a savage roar, Vidya screeches, ""**I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH THE STEREO**"" and proceeds to wreck the entire kitchen. After an eternal two minutes of animalistic violence the room is covered in pizza, broken crockery, Vidya's blood and what might or might not be urine.

We take this as an indicator that the party is over and start to head off. Weakly, the injured alpha bitch pulls herself out from under a pile of pizza boxes and chokes out, ""What did I do wrong?""

I sigh and look her square in the eye and say,

""We can't rewind, we've gone too far. Vidya killed the radio, Star.""",[Long] So I had a friend who was really into video games...,6

His friend agreed to this and went to a graveyard and nailed a piece of nail on someone's graveyard. When he finished, he stood up and turned around but he felt someone pulling his pants. He knew he shouldnt have done that. He thought he pissed someone off. 

He was too frightened to look back and kept pulling his legs forward hoping the other person might let go. He ended up going home butt naked. 

Thing was he accidently nailed his pants along with the nail on the graveyard. 

I am not sure about this, but if I remember correctly, it's based on the a true story. Happened years ago, and where I lived, graveyards are in the back of the church and there are no lights there either. Since it was a test of courage, sometimes people take the bet HEHE.

Two brothers, one of their wives, and a woman in red. The talent agent leans back in his chair and asks ""so...what kind of act do you do?""  

The brothers start taking their shirts off, the women start taking their blouses off, and pretty soon all four are completely naked. The brothers start jerking each other off, while the woman in red collects their excretions in a bowl made from a goat's skull.  

The wife brandishes a ceremonial knife and cuts deeply into her middle finger, draining the blood into the goat skull. She cries out in anguish, as the woman in red screams ""EAT THE PAIN!""  

The brothers pin the woman in red down and start massaging her breasts. Her 69 year old breasts begin lactating, prompting the brothers to greedily begin suckling, pausing only to spit into the bowl.  

""If you are doing occult magic in the context of an agent's private office, it is not art,"" the woman in red clarifies between labored breaths.  

The woman sits upright, and the four take turns urinating on each other and into the bowl. The contents are mixed together while the brothers begin salivating, wafting the pungent odors into their faces in hungry expectation.  

A group of underage teenagers burst in through the door and begin stripping their clothes off as well. The four adults begin taking pictures, declaring their intentions of mounting the photos onto the walls of their bedrooms. One nude teen bends over backwards, his heels nearly touching his forehead.  

""I really want a sculpture of this in my private home!"" one of the brothers declares.  

The naked teens, late for Lolita Express, gather their clothes and walk out the door as a CNN reporter sitting outside temporarily catches a glimpse of the debauchery before dutifully looking away. ""I didn't see anything,"" he tells himself(he did).  

The four begin drinking their meal from the goat skull. A brother thumps his chest prompting a burp, sending the white and red mixture of bodily fluids sprinkling over nightmare dreams.  

The agent looks at the form. ""So this is some sort of Satanic act?""  

The woman in red glares at him. ""I'm not Satanist!Stop it!""  

The agent looks down at the form. ""But your name has 666 in it. And why did you list 'Earthquake day' as today's date?""  

Covered in blood, sweat, urine, semen and breast milk, the four stare intently at the talent agent, who asks ""So...what do you call yourselves?""

So the lawyer asks him if he's the magical sort of genie who gives out wishes. The genie explains that indeed he is but with a catch: whatever the lawyer asks for, every other lawyer in the world gets double of.  

The lawyer, being the selfish fellow he is, almost leaves without making any wishes. But finally he decides that he might as well give it a shot. So first the lawyer says that he's always wanted a Ferrari and in not half a second his brand new Ferrari appears in the parking lot and the genie hands him the key. So now every lawyer in the world has two Ferarris.  

Then the lawyer thinks about what else he might want but realizes that he has a meeting in just 5 minutes so he asks for ten million dollars. And in not half a second a silver suitcase containing ten million dollars with crisp hundred dollar bills appears before his eyes.  

The lawyer still can't get over the fact that every other lawyer now has TWENTY million dollars. So then the genie says, what is your third wish?  

So the lawyer thinks for a while and he finally says

He was standing outside the bank and saw a pair of armed robbers fleeing with bags of money. He rushed home, certain he'd be able to break the news. He shouted, ""You'll never guess what just happened... the bank was robbed,"" 

""I know it..."" 

He replied, ""In a pig's ass you do!"" But his brother simply stated, ""I heard it on the radio.""

""Fuck! That's it! I am going out to bring home some news!"" The first brother left and spent the day watching for something he could surprise his brother with before the radio broke the news. At the end of the day, exhausted and frustrated, he gave up and started home. He looked out into a field and saw a large pig stuck in a fence. He walked over and notice the pig couldn't move at all. He thought, I'm still a virgin, if I lost my virginity, that would be something I could tell my brother. He proceeded to drop his pants, position himself behind the pig and fuck it in the ass. It was over in a few seconds and he cleaned up and headed home.

When he arrived home, he burst through the door and shouted at his brother, ""You'll never believe it! I had sex!"" His brother shouted out in disbelief, ""Ya right! In a pig's ass you did!""

post,5bdklh,2qh72,jokes,false,1478397796,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5bdklh/long_the_girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""* ""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.""So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""*Video Games*."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrowSo next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" ""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.""""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",[Long] The girlfriend joke,2

So the men leave for the jungle, and after a while the first one returned with 10 apples. The chief then ordered him to stick all ten of them up his butt without making any expression of joy or sorrow. Despite having a little bit of trouble with the first ones, he managed to keep a poker face until, at the 5th apple, he started crying. He was summarily executed.
The next guy came in with 10 grapes. The chief ordered him to do the same as the first guy. The grapes went up his anus with ease, but after the 9th grape, the man started laughing hysterically. Hence, he too was summarily executed.
The first two guys soon met in heaven and the first guy ask the second, ""Why did you start laughing? You only needed one more grape and you'd have gotten away!""
The second guy answered, still laughing, ""I couldn't help it. I saw the third guy walking in with 10 pineapples.""","While hiking in the Amazon jungle, 3 guys were attacked by a huge pack of natives that captured them and knocked them out.",3

The day comes and the pair are a tad late. Most of the seating is filled already. They begin to walk down the aisle, but Mike Tyson has this bag of Spitz sunflower seeds that he can't seem to put down. As they're walking to their seats in the front row Tyson keeps spitting the God damned shells out onto the floor making an ass of himself. They sit down at their assigned seats.

The pope sees them from his podium and slowly walks towards them.  The pope stops right in front of Tyson and inaudibly mumbles something in an aged and raspy voice while pointing and seemingly 'blessing' Mike Tyson with the traditional 'up, down, left and right' hand gesture symbolic of the cross, and walks agedly away.

Now, Jackson is a bit befuddled by this and says to Tyson,

""How come he only blessed you?""

Tyson replies,

""Bleth me, you kiddin'?

You neglected your children as you went on one vacation after another with the athlete, and abused them whenever he was out of town leaving you bored.  You may enter heaven now.""  In tears and bewildered, the woman enters the kingdom of heaven where angels begin pampering her.

God addressed the black man: ""You have lead a good and virtuous life.  You were an upstanding member of your community and loyal to your family.  You did your best to hurt no one.  I cast thee into hell.""  Equally bewildered, the black man tumbles into the pits of hell where demons begin prodding him with pitchforks.
