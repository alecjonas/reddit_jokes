Immediately Peter rushes over to the cross, only to be hit severely over the head by the roman guard. He gets on his feet again and wants to return to the other disciples when he hears Jesus calling again, 

""Peter, come hither!"" 

So, again Peter tries to climb the cross to get to his lord, when the roman soldier draws his sword and chops Peter's arm off. Peter is getting a little pissed and wants to go back to his buddies, but again Jesus summons.

Peter is now covered in blood and demented from the blow to the head and wants to call it a day. Jesus hoarsly croaks, 

""Peter, please, come to me!"" 

By now, the roman gurad is tired of chopping limbs, so he lets Peter be. The faithful disciple struggles to climb the cross (without arms mind you) and after a long while he finally arrives at his Lord's side. Hurting, suffering, bleeding, Peter looks into his Master's eyes and asks,

It's not a story, it's a poem.

The rhyming scheme is crummy.    
    

Two robots were sitting in a canoe    
They did not know what to do    
So they sat there and waited    
While their software upgraded    

""Ha! Today I've learned something new!    
Our bodies keep the canoe afloat    
And if I get off of this boat    
I won't be stuck sinking with YOU!""    ",Two robots were sitting in a canoe.,0

I did a quick search in the seats where I had been sitting, nothing. I asked everybody if they had seen my keys... nope. Then it hit me, I must have left them in the ute. Frantically, I headed for the parking lot outside Bunnings.
My wife, Faye has scolded me a thousand times for leaving the keys in the ignition. My theory is the ignition is the best place not to lose them. Her theory is that the car will be stolen if I do that. As I burst through the doors of Bunnings and out into the parking lot, I came to a terrifying conclusion. Her theory was right. The parking lot was empty, no ute
I immediately call the police. I gave them my location, confessed that I had left my keys in the ute, and that it had been stolen. Then I made the most difficult call of all.
""Honey,"" I stammered. I always call her honey in times like these. ""I left my keys in the ute, and it has been stolen.""
There was a period of silence. I thought the call had been dropped, but then I heard Faye's voice.
""Kris,"" she barked, ""I dropped you off at Bunnings on my way to the grocery store!""

When he first got the job, We asked him where he was from, but he would always just shrug off the question. Nevertheless, Joe and I got along really well.

One day, he approached me and asked if he could move in with me and my girlfriend. He told us about how our job wasn't paying enough for him to live alone, so we agreed and he moved in a few days later.

He was an alright roommate. He always cleaned up after himself, he never made the apartment smell, and he was always on time when rent was due. The only thing that made me nervous about him was the way he looked at my girlfriend with a face of lust on his face. I eventually asked my girlfriend is she had noticed him doing this. She timidly declined noticing.

Several months pass, and I receive some wonderful news; my girlfriend is pregnant! With Joe living in our apartment, I had been able to save more money in the bank, so after receiving the news, I immediately went out and bought a set of wedding rings and brought my girlfriend out to a fancy restaurant that night. It was there that I proposed to her. The moment I did, however, she began to tear up and say that she couldn't marry me. I asked her why. She told me that the baby wasn't mine, it was Joe's.

Filled with rage, I immediately drove home and confronted Joe about what he had done. He tried telling me to calm down, but in my rage, I threw a punch that hit him right in the eye. He screamed in pain and ran into his room. By the time he emerged an hour later, he had packed his suitcase full of all of his things. His eye had swollen up and looked like a ball of cotton. He left that night, and as quick as he had entered my life, he was gone.

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe, I'd been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living....,4

The next day, the devil stops to check on them and sees them dressed in parkas, mittens and bomber hats, warming themselves around the fire.
The devil asks them, ""What are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?""

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats.
The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""

Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""

The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Michigan and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""

The two Michiganders reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.
The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.
The devil was dumbfounded. ""I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?""

I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution, in order to escape a possible conflict with him. (Even when totally smashed... 3 cuckoos plus 9 cuckoos totals = 12 cuckoos MIDNIGHT!)

Then he said 'We need a new cuckoo clock.' When I asked him why, he said, 'Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times then said 'oh shit.' Cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another three times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted.

Once the man is finished changing into a tuxedo, and his wife into a evening gown, they notice that the butler still hasn't come back yet. They begin to worry, as the ball is in one hour. They try their best to prepare without him, but they are fairly clueless about what to do.  
  
Soon, guests start arriving, but the husband and wife are too embarrassed to answer the door, for fear of being seen as slobs by their guests. Ten minutes later, the butler bursts through the front door with a small package in his hand, and rushes off into the kitchen, apologising to the husband as he passes him.  
  
Furious, the couple march into the kitchen to find that the butler has emptied a pack of chewing gum into a frying pan.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’
‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’
The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘
Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’
The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’
Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.
Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’
The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.
Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.
‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’
The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.
Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.
The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

Then he thought, ""I sure am thirsty"", and built a brewery and started making beer.  
Later God and Saint Peter were reviewing the list of people who had died recently and God noticed that Peter had sent the engineer to hell by mistake.

No one could possibly imagine anything could go wrong on such a day as this.  The sun was out early, birds could be heard chirping in the trees. The sky was blue not a cloud in sight.

So our hero decides to invite his best friend on a fishing trip.  They load up the rods, the bait, the chest full of lures and hooks and of course the beers.  Some would say this was their first mistake, but our duo sets off on the highway for a few hours and eventually turn off on some smaller roads. To finally get off the paved streets and onto a dirt trail for maybe another 2 hours.

All goes well at arrival and the pair is off on the water in no time. After a short time and a few beers, re-tellers of the story argue on the number, the wind picks up and before they have time to react it's already raining lightly and the waves pick up.

Fear sets in the boat and after lightning bursts and a huge wave hits the side of their boat our heroe's best friend falls into the water without him noticing.

The now swimming friend calls out our heroe's name! Not sure if he heard something, our hero turns around and sees an empty boat, and realises he did here something. ""What did you say?"" He exclaims

Now the skies were pure dark, thunder bellowed every 5 seconds and flashes appeared left and right.  And our victim yells his friends name out once again. Calling out for help essentially

But through all the noise it was hard to make out, ""what did you say?"" Replies our antagonist. Now getting angered, and almost drowning he yells out his friend name what seems to be one last time. 

In the distance another boat is seen. And looks to be diverting course towards our troubled duo. Our hero distracted by this, and also hopes they come to help, suddenly gets back on track and could make out the general direction his friend was in cause of what he was yelling. And so he asked again ""what did you say?""

No sound from the water... the second boat is maybe 500 meters away when they hoist a flag. It has a skull and two crossed bones on it.  Our hero panics and suddenly sees his friend surface from the water. And his catches a big breath of air and yells out our heroe's name.  

Clearly he can now see Pete his best friend in the water. Finger tips barely touching if they would be trying to grab each other.  But our hero now look angry puts his hands on the side of the boat. Leans over close to his friend and says ""What did you say?""",Ambush!,1

One of the English can't hold himself and goes to a Japanese and asks: ""Why aren't you guys laughing? Don't you find it funny?""

I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really.

 I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing.


Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through.


 I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. 


There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. 


He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said ""what are you doing"" ""are you sure, you want this."" I told him ""please, this is what I want"", and then he went with it too. I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like ""Damnit Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin you no treefiddy!""",TIFU by sleeping with a guy for the first time,105

Not to be disheartened she decided to wander next door to her neighbour, the little green man, to see if he would be kind enough to lend her some of his.  So she closed her little white cupboards, grabbed her little white coat and went through her little white door, locking it behind her, walked down her little white stars to her little white path and out past her little white letterbox turning left to see the little green man.

The little green man was up a little green ladder painting his little green house the most amazing shade of green you have ever seen.
""Mr. Green"" she shouted, ""Do you have a cup of sugar i can borrow?"" The little green man could not here her so he paced down his little green ladder and put down his little green bucket of paint and little green paintbrush and said ""sorry? could you repeat that?""

""do you have a little cup of sugar i might borrow"" 

""I am sorry Ms. White but I am afraid not, i lent my sugar to Mr. Red as he is making his own beer, however he may have some left""

""Ah thank you Mr. Green"" she said, and wandered back down his little green path, out his little white gate, noticing for the first time Mr. green did not have a little green letterbox, rather a little green slit in his little green door. (This point will be important later).

out she went walking back past her little white house and towards the traffic lights. Pressing the little silver button and waiting for the red crossing man to turn green before she crossed. As she waited she began thinking about how her day of easy baking a little white cake had turned into such as disaster, and the sun was beginning to heat up considerably. 

The crossing signal turned green and so she wandered towards the little red man's house. Passing his little red letterbox, down his little red path and towards his little red door. The Little white woman knocked three times and waited for the little red man to open the door. but he did not. 

So she knocked again, louder this time. perhaps he was filling his little red bottles with beer. But still no reply. She tries the little red door handle. The little red door opens. she walks into his little red living room, and shouts ""Mr Red, Are you hoooome?"" 

""ill be down in a minute, I was just showering"" 

""not a problem"" she calls back up stairs 

The little red man emerges soon with a little red towel wrapped around his waist, little red chest hairs visible around his nipples. 

""I was wondering if i might borrow a cup of sugar for my little white cake""

""ah no problem at all"" said the little red man ""you know i had to borrow some off The little  green man across the road.""

""yes he did mention it"" 

The little red man got a little red chair from his little red dining room and placed it in the kitchen next to the little red bench, then stepped onto the chair to reach his quite high little red cupboards. 

""can you please pass me a little red cup"" he asked as he opened the cupboards. the little white woman did so and as he turned to recieve the cup his towel fell clean off and onto the floor. 

The little white woman was shocked! never had she been so humiliated and abashed in her life and so without another word turned on the spot and half marched half ran out of his little red house, down his little red path and across the road towards her little white house.

Where she was promptly hit by a Big yellow truck. 

By the time the Paramedics arrived in there little blue van it was too late, the little white woman was dead. Which just goes to show, that you should never cross while the red man is flashing.

Uh yeah, we're very sorry about that, the husband replied.

The bartender responds with a smile, ""We have a little challenge here, been going on for a while. It's $20 to enter, you keep everything if you win. Want to hear it?""

The man nods.

""There are three parts to this challenge,"" the bartender says, setting a jar of peppers on the counter.

""First, you have to eat every pepper in this jar without stopping.""

""Second, there's an angry dog out back with a sore tooth. Get it out for him.""

""Third, there's an old woman upstairs who's never been with anyone. You need to give her something to remember.""

The man gulps, but looks back at the money and decides to take the risk. He hands over a $20 and sets to work. 

The first thing the man does is order a bottle of whiskey, thinking alcohol will numb the heat of the peppers. He downs the entire bottle.

The now-drunk man staggers back to the jar of peppers, and begins to eat. Tears run down his face and his eyes burn, but he refuses to make a face.

Through a whiskey-addled haze the man realizes he has completed the first part of the challenge. He gives a victory hiccup and stumbles outside to the angry dog.

From inside, the patrons begin to hear a loud commotion outside.

First shouting, then screaming, then crying can be heard.

Finally, the man stumbles back inside, clothes torn and bleeding from a few places.

The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process.

After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he decided to call it a day when a lone, armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bellringers job. The bishop was incredulous, ""You have no arms!""

""No matter,"" said the man, ""Observe!""

He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo.

Suddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below.

The stunned bishop rushed to his side. When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before. As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, ""Bishop, who was this man?""

""I don't know his name,"" the bishop sadly replied, ""but his face rings a bell.""

The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bellringer of Notre Dame.

The first man to approach him said, ""Your excellency, I am the brother of the poor, armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday. I pray that you honor his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.""

The bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot.

Two monks, hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy,rushed up the stairs to his side.

Here are some examples of these jokes. ‘A stoned man sent his wife a picture of himself on a horse, with the following caption: ‘I’m on top!!!’. ‘One said to his wife: “I want to call you Flower, but flowers wither. I want to call you Moon, but the Moon cannot be seen during the day. So, I have decided to call you Pen*s as it is also attached to me”’. ‘An old woman went to a pleasure shop and asked the sale man: How much is the red thing over there? The salesman replied: “I am afraid that thing… is a fire extinguisher”’.

Male chatting is full of erotic innuendos. For example, one would say to friends: ‘I went to work this morning, but I forgot my glasses, so I went all the way back home to get them’. Friends would then comment: ‘Aha, so you went _all the way_? Ha-ha’. So, friends here, restate the phrase ‘all the way’ emphasising intercourse. 

When some Saudi men are together outside the country, they feel good by describing the elements of the women they run into. They satisfy themselves with so little given their limited access and exposure to women back in their home country.

""Nothing, my truck is empty"" replies the driver.

One week later, the same man pulls up in a truck. Again, he claims that his truck is empty. The border agent gets a bit suspicious. He looks inside the truck. He looks underneath the truck. He looks on top of the truck. He even looks under the hood, but finds no contraband, and has to let him go. 


A few days after that, the shady driver tries to cross the border again. By this point, the border agent is certain that he is smuggler, but has not been able to find any proof. He has a team of sniffer dogs search the truck. Nothing. He uses an X-ray scanner. Nothing. Infuriated, the agent has to let the driver go again. 


This continues every week or so for years. The border agent is 100% convinced the driver is smuggling. Every time he makes a thorough search of his vehicle, but always comes up empty. 


On the agent's last day before retiring, the suspicious driver arrives once again. The border agent just *has* to figure out the truth or it will haunt him forever. ""This is my last day here,"" he says ""I swear I won't arrest you. I know you have been sneaking something right under my nose for all these years. What are you smuggling?""

The waitress asks them for their orders. 

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?' 
'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich. 

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. 

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke' 
The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same' 

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 

'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. 
'Same,' says the ostrich. 

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' 

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer.
""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?"" 

Says the man, ""Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. 

The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

The waitress said ""That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there"" says the man proudly.

The waitress asks, ""But, what's that ostrich all about?""

The man sighs, pauses and answers with a heavy heart, ""My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who accompanies me wherever I go and agrees with everything I say ...""",A Man &amp; an Ostrich,60
