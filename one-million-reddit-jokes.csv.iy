Guy takes his first apple and gets it in without issue, likewise with the 2nd apple. The 3rd apple take a bit more but he gets it in. With the 4th apple, it's getting difficult and more so with the 5th. At the 6th apple he can't do it anymore, grimaces, and is killed on the spot.

2nd guy gets back, and all he has is a handful of berries. Chief gives him the same challenge. which the guy accepts. First berry in is nothing. same with the 2nd, 3rd, and so on. If fact, he almost finished when he just suddenly starts laughing his head off, and so is killed.

The 2 meet up in heaven where the first guy asks the second why he sarted laughing when he was almost home free. Second guy goes..

As the last guests departed the affair, his wife, Helen, turned to her oldest friend. 

“Well, I’m sure Joe would be pleased,” she said. 
“I’m sure you’re right,” replied Jody, who lowered her voice and leaned in close. 

“How much did this really cost?” 
      
“All of it,” said Helen. “Thirty thousand.” 
        
“No!” Jody exclaimed. “I mean, it was very nice, but $30,000?” 
       
 Helen answered. “The funeral was $6,500. I donated $500 to the church. The wake, food, and drinks were another $500. The rest went for the memorial stone.”

To this, Esther replied, ""Morris that helicopter ride is fifty dollars and fifty dollars is fifty dollars."" 


The pilot overheard the couple and said, ""Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word, I won't charge you! But if you say one word, it's fifty dollars.""


Morris and Esther agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word.


When they landed, the pilot turned to Morris and said, ""By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm impressed!"" 


Morris replied, ""Well, to tell you the truth, I almost said something when Esther fell out, but you know, fifty dollars is fifty dollars

Her name was Stacey.

One day I asked Stacey out on a date.

She turned me down.

You see I used to have a stutter, and she thought that it was annoying.

I was like: “Okay, whatever b-b-b-bitch.”

I didn’t see her again for two years.

I was walking on the street when I saw her.

She looked awful.

Her skin had lost its color and was almost gray. Her fingernails were long, yellow, and chipped. Her hair had gone from silky smooth to a knotty mess. She looked up at me and her eyes were bloodshot and looked like they were about to fall out of her head. Her face was twitching rapidly and contorting into a spectrum of expressions and emotions all at once.

She’d gotten hooked on crack.

It was like I was looking at an entirely different person.

“Stacey… is that you?”

She whipped her head around at me and her eyes lit up.

“Oh hey! You’re that kid who had the stutter… Daniel!”

“My name is Damien. Stacey, have you been smokingcrack? What happened to you? How did you get like this?”

She paused for a moment and began to sob.

“My life just fell apart. I got involved with the wrong people, and I lost my job, my car, everything.”

“I want to help you. Do you have any more crack?”

“Yeah a little, I was saving it for later.”

“I’m not going to let you smoke that. Give it to me. I’m going to get you checked into rehab and soon you’ll get your life on track.”

She looked at me with optimism in her eyes.

“You’re right. I need to get help. Thank you for helping me realize that. Here.”

At the Pearly Gates, they are met by St. Peter. He says, ""Sisters, you all led such exemplary lives that the Lord is granting you six months

The first nun says, ""I want to be Sophia Loren.""

And ‘poof’ she's gone.

The second says, ""I want to be Madonna and ‘poof’ she's gone.

The third says, ""I want to be Alberta Pipalini.""

St. Peter looks perplexed. ""Who ?"", he ask

""Alberta Pipalini,"" replies the nun.

St. Peter shakes his head and says, ""I'm sorry, but that name just doesn't ring a bell.""

The nun then takes a newspaper out of her habit and hands it to St. Peter.

St. Peter reads the paper and starts laughing. He hands it back to her and says,

""No sister, the paper says it was the 'Alberta Pipeline' that was laid by 1,400 men in 6 months.""

“Unmarried too I’d hope?”

“I sure am”

“I can’t keep this from you any longer Nun, it’s eating me up.”

“What is it my dear?”

“Well first off, I’m not actually catholic. I’m actually Jewish. And secondly I’m actually married with two kids.”

“Well that’s terrible that you’d lie to a Nun. But I appreciate the ride to the costume party, names John by the way.”

They begin with the Asian. They give him a camera and show him a picture of a coffee shop across the street, and tell him that he needs to take a picture of the coffee shop from the exact same angle as the initial picture, so that all the pixels line up. They give him ten tries, and he is told that, for each try that he doesn't use up, he will be given a dog as a gift. If he wastes all ten tries, he is to be executed. 

The Asian fails five times, then requests a permission to go to the bathroom. His permission is granted. He continues to fail his other shots, and is then executed. 

Given the same instructions, the black man, more ambitious than him, tries again but fails on all of his ten tries. He dies a grisly death. 

The white man thinks to himself ""well, this is it"", then proceeds to impeccably reproduce the picture on the first try. Astonished, one of the agents hears a murmur from another. He explains to the white man: ""you see, while you did a great job, my colleague Drew here told me that the Asian ate all the dogs when he lied to us about going to the bathroom. Is it OK if we reward you in cats?"" 

The white man begins to cry. 
""What is it?"" the agent inquired. ""Don't you like cats? "" 

Then came the response:
""You don't understand. I'm allergic to cat hair.""",[Long] The torture experiment,1

Now, this firing squad was rather well-known to be the most gullible group around, and it’s due to this knowledge that the first man started to hatch a cunning plan to escape.

&amp;nbsp;

The execution begins: the first man kneels on the ground with his hands behind his head. The firing squad commander cleared his throat, and in a loud clear voice shouted, 

“Ready! Aim!”

The first man then screams, “EARTHQUAKE!”

&amp;nbsp;

The firing squad panicked and scrambled for cover. By the time they realised there was no earthquake, the first man was gone. Nothing they can do now, they move on to the second man.

&amp;nbsp;

The second man kneels on the ground with his hands behind his head. He saw what the first man did, and therefore, saw his ticket to freedom. The firing squad commander cleared his throat, and in a loud clear voice shouted, 

“Ready! Aim!”

The second man then exclaims, “HURRICANE!”

&amp;nbsp;

The firing squad panicked and scrambled for cover. By the time they realised there was no hurricane, the second man was gone. Nothing they can do now, they move on to the last man.

“Well, anyone can play the clarinet!” the bartender exclaims. He huffs off to the back office and comes back holding a bagpipe. He hands it to the octopus. “Here! Let’s see what you can do with this!”

Soon he was invited to deliver a significant paper at a conference, coincidentally held in his home town. He walked on stage and placed his papers on the lectern, but they slid off onto the floor.As he bent over to retrieve them, at precisely the wrong instant, he inadvertently farted.

The microphone amplified his mistake resoundingly through the room and reverberated it down the hall. He was most embarrassed but somehow regained his composure just long enough to deliver his paper.

He ignored the thunderous applause and raced out the stage door, never to return to his home town again, until many years later, when his elderly mother was ill and he returned to visit her.
He reserved a hotel room under the name of Smith and arrived under cover of darkness. The desk clerk asked him, ""Is this your first visit to our city, Mr. Smith?""

Dr. Goldberg replied, ""Well, young man, no, it isn't. I grew up here and received my education here, but then I moved away.""

""Haven't you visited since?"" asked the desk clerk.

""Actually, I did visit once, many years ago, but an embarrassing thing happened and since then I've been too ashamed to return.”

Trying his best to console him, the desk clerk replied ""Sir, while I don't have your life experience, one thing I have learned is that often what seems embarrassing to me isn't even remembered by others. I bet that's true of your incident too.”

Dr. Goldberg replied, ""Son, I doubt that's the case with my incident.”

The clerk asked, ""Was it a long time ago?""

Dr. Goldberg replied, ""Yes, many years.”

""Doc, ya gotta help.""

""Okay.. I can do that!"" And off he goes.

The cowboy races back to the mountain, it's almost as if his horse can sense the urgency... they are flying. He makes it halfway up the mountain trail before having to dismount and he starts running, grabbing 2 sticks on the way.

Simon, a high school student, passed his sophomore year with a 100% in Algebra 2. Thinking he was the most outstanding student ever, he went to his counselor to ask if he can skip directly to Calculus AB.

""Calculus is a very rigorous subject,"" the counselor advised, ""You need to take Precalculus first.""

""Well I heard Precalculus is mostly review from Algebra 2,"" Simon reasoned, ""I believe I can handle the difficulties at my skill level.""

The counselor saw that Simon was adamant and would not take no for an answer, so he complied with a sigh.

When the school year started, Simon went to class thinking he must be the youngest student there, and he was pretty smug about it. All went well until the second week, things started to fall apart...

The teacher, Mr. Wong (yes ik that sounds like Mr. Kuang) started going into derivatives. Simon realized that he was struggling to understand the lessons! However his pride made him keep everything to himself. Simon thought eventually things will move on.

By the chapter test, Simon was panicking. The test is worth 15% of his grade, yet he doesn't understand a single concept!

As you probably guessed, Simon got a 17% on the test.

Crying, he went back to his counselor and begged to be moved back to Precalculus.

He says to himself, ""this is bullshit, i'm the most powerful man in the world, i've got to get this fixed,"" so he calls around to his rich friends and gets the number of this urologist doctor in Europe, innovator, #1 doctor in the world. He makes an appointment and flies to Switzerland.

Trump says ""Well doc, it's the strangest thing, I've always had a great sex life, with my wives or otherwise, but just recently no matter what I do I can't have an orgasm. I've tried all kinds of techniques and medicines but nothing works.""

The doctor says ""OK Donald, go ahead and get undressed and get up on the exam table and we'll have a look at you."" So Trump takes off all his clothes and gets up on the table.

Doctor says ""OK Donald, first thing I want you to do is get down on your hands and knees and crawl into that corner of the room over there.""

Trump thinks ""what? how on earth can this help . . . "" but he thinks ""hey, this guy is the best in the business, i'll just go with it. ""

Doctor says ""Mmmm hmmm . . . OK now, Mr. Trump, would you now please crawl over there to that wall, underneath that window?

And now at this point, Trump is fed up. He says, ""Doctor, I have to know, how is this helping with my problem?""

The man asks what the clocks are for, and why they keeping spinning forward one hour at random. St. Peter explains that each living person on earth has a clock there, and each time they act like an asshole, they lose an hour of their life. 

The man thinks about it, then asks: “Can I see Donald Trump’s clock?”

St Peter replies: “Of course, you’ll have to come into the office though, we’ve been using his clock as a fan in this hot weather.”",Heavenly clocks,2

The rich daughter begins to get annoyed that she isn't impressed like most other girls in the town so she continues. ""The other day my daddy also got me a $500 stallion mare straight in from texas!"" The middle class daughter, still unphased looks at her with a warm smile and says ""Well that's nice.""

""Well my daddy also got me a whole set of gold and ruby jewelery just to see me happy!"" Again the middle class daughter just says ""Well that's nice.""
Not being able to stand it anymore and guessing the middle class daughter must have something better, she asks ""Well what did your daddy get you?!""

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

Answer - A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.

The Interview Board was impressed by his original ideas. They asked him to wait outside; but also advised him not to reveal the questions, as they may ask the same questions to other candidates also.

When the young man went out of the room, a person inquired about the questions asked. The young man said that he had promised the interview board not to disclose the questions.

But, the person found a way out. ""Tell me the answer you gave.""

The young man, thought it to be okay, as he was not going back on his words of ""not disclosing the QUESTIONS"". So he gave him the three answer which the person quickly learnt by heart.

When that person went in for interview, this is what happened.

Q 1. When were you born?

That person:- The efforts started long back, but could succeed in 1947.

Interviewers got confused...they asked next question.

Q 2. What is your father's name?

That person :- There are many people, who were involved and contributed in this. If I give a name, it will be injustice to others.

The board members were shocked at the reply..they said.

Q 3. Are you mad?

That person :- A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.",Once a Bright and Intelligent young man went for an IAS (Indian Civil Service) interview,51

There’s not a single seat open and the isles are overflowing with passengers whom have just gotten off work. The woman sighs and says “I be so tired.” Nearby passengers hear her, but ignore the woman as they greedily keep their seats. The woman speaks up again, “I be so tired... and my legs just be so weak.” A few passengers exchange annoyed glances, but not a single one offers their seat to the woman. The woman, even louder this time, says “I be so tired and pregnant and my legs just be so weak!” A few of the men shoot straight up and finally offer the woman their seats. She graciously accepts an offer and sits down next to another woman of about the same age. The other woman asks the first “so, how far along are you?” To which she replies “Oh, about 25 minutes.”
