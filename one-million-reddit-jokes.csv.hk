As a token of his friendship, the farmer immediately invited the Martian couple in his home and begged them to stay for the evening and have dinner, so the Martians agreed. 

Later that night, the Martian man explained how, on their planet, it was customary to swap partners as a token of friendship. The farmer, not wanting to offend his alien visitors, readily agreed. 

The Martian then man took the farmer's wife into one bedroom while the farmer took the Martian woman into another. 
They had been having sex for about an hour when the Martian man asked the farmer's wife, ""Well, how do you like having sex with a Martian? How does it feel?""
 The farmer's wife replied ""It needs to be a little bigger around."" 

So the Martian man twisted his right ear and presto, his penis became bigger around. 
About an hour later, the Martian man asked the farmer's wife again ""How does it feel now?"" 
The farmer's wife responded ""I think it needs to be a little longer."" 
So the Martian man twisted his left ear and presto, his penis became longer. 

The next morning, after their alien neighbors had left, the farmer and his wife were having coffee at the breakfast table and the farmer asked his wife ""How was the Martian man?"" 
To this, the farmer's wife replied ""Fine."" ""And how about the Martian woman?""

""I'm aware of that and you're not going to change my mind; either you book me in to be castrated or I'll simply go to another doctor.""

""Well, OK."" says the doctor. ""But it's against my better judgement!""

So Steve has his operation and the next day he is up and walking very slowly, legs apart, down the hospital corridor with his drip stand.

Heading towards him is another patient, who is walking exactly the same way.

""Hi there!"" says Steve. ""It looks as if you've just had the same operation as me.""

""Well..."" said the patient. ""I finally decided after 37 years of life that I would like to be circumcised.""

The next time they were out, they were answering a call about wood roaches. Bill asked him where he should spray. Rick said again, ""if there's a place or a thing in the bug's name, spray there, because that's where they are and where we don't want them to be.""

He was one of the most powerful men known on the planet, as he was the one who was able to absorb the powers, also known as Traits, of others. This led to him being feared among many others. 

The League of Heroes decided that Jack had to be put down. They called all the top class heroes, the best of the best, to work together and formulate a plan to take down the beast that is Jack.

The heroes could control fire, water, earth, wind and all the elements of the world. Some could shapeshift, while others had superhuman strength. Some could fly, and some could camouflage. With all these Traits, surely they can take Jack down.

A huge battle occured in the downtown area of the city, 1 Jack vs 100 heroes. Flames erupted and the earth shook and the sky cracked, yet Jack came out victorious. The director of the League of Heroes decided that he had enough of bloodshed. He knew he had to use his trump card. THAT.

He went to the deepest of jungles, the darkest of passages and the creepiest of castles, to finally reach The First Church. He went in and called for her. The Nun who prayed for evolution of mankind. For strength beyond belief, and powers beyond imagination. The one who started it all, Seira. He knew she could stop Jack.

He told Seira of the big trouble, and with no hesitation she fought Jack. Flames erupted and the earth shook and the sky cracked, yet Jack came out victorious. However, it was not a battle against Jack, to the director's demise, as he only found out that Jack was Seira's master.

As the director of the League of Heroes admitted defeat, feeling betrayed, he named the madman aptly, before his own suicide.

When she went to look for it she found a frog in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes.""

The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, ""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to.""

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""

Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.

Attention female readers: This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue to feel good.

Male readers: Please scroll down.

The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife.

Moral of the story: Women think they're really smart.

Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show.

""10 bucks."" the driver replies.

""And how much for you to suck my cock afterwards?""

“Hello there!”, said the farmer’s wife. “You wanna buy some peppers? We got all kinds!

“Well, that’s our famous ‘L’ Pepper. We grow these in a special type of soil that makes the pepper L-shaped. We don’t have them here, but my husband Pete is at the other farm where they’re grown, and he can send them here in a matter of seconds!

The man was incredulous. “How in the hell can he have them here in seconds!?”

The farmer’s wife pointed to a large pipe that seemed to stretch for miles. “It’s a vacuum tube! We can pipe product back and forth in the blink of an eye.”

“I’ve got to see this,” said the man. “Order me a large pack of ‘L’ peppers please.”

Three dogs are chasing after a poodle because they desire her. They chase her down a few back alleys, and upon cornering her in a dead end, the poodle proposes something to the three.

""The one who can make me laugh with a joke shall be my lover.""

Easy enough, right? Thinking quickly on their feet (since dogs do things best on their feet), the dogs come up with a dozen one-liners that are sure to get a chuckle out of her. She speaks again,

""However, the joke must include liver and cheese.""

Crap. There go all their plans. She points to the bulldog, and asks him what his joke is. ""Uhh... I like cheese?"" It's the best he had, but it wasn't good enough. She moves on to the next hound, a Doberman. ""Um... I like liver?"" Once again, unimpressed. The third dog, a Chihuahua, gets his shot. He puts himself between her and the other two, saying...

""Liver alone, cheese mine.""

He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.
After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said,'
If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'

The word got around and nobody called him that any more.
Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.
He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.
The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.

Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.
She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day,
Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

The Italian:

-We have nothing to argue, I'll be courting her. I'm an Italian anyway. It's in our nature.

The fight begins. The wrestlers go out on the mat. The first round begins. After one minute, the Japanese made his favorite grip on the American. The coach, seeing this, went totally desperate. He took his towel and left the hall. He went to his room disappointed and angry. At one time he turned on the TV in the room and saw the glad American, everybody greets him. He became a world champion. The coach takes whiskey for surprise and goes back to the hall. And indeed. The American became a champion. After the celebration, the congratulations and the awards, the teacher calmed down with the American and inquired with curiosity:

- What happened, John? I do not believe my eyes! How did you do it?

- Well see trainer, ""the American wrestler said, ""How can I explain it to you? I also thought everything was lost when the Japanese caught me with this grip. He folded me in eight. I struggled, crawled, moaning, but suddenly I saw some balls shivered in front of my eyes. I thought a little, and in the next second I bit them with all my strength.""

- Oh, John! "", the coach complained. ""That's not nice. It's not sporting. This is not a fair play. You have earned it wrong"".

-It wasn't trainer! "", John said, ""But, you do not understand. You just can not imagine what a man is capable of when he bites his own balls.""

Finally, broke, hungry, living on the street, he tries again. ""God, please, my life is a wreck. I have no car, no home, no family. Please let me win the lottery just this once so that I can turn my life around. I beg you.""

Suddenly, a flash of light comes from the sky, and the voice of God echoes down from the heavens. ""Dave, meet me halfway, buy a fucking ticket.""","In honor of tonight’s Lotto, one of my favorite jokes to tell.",3732

Police show up and Joe is questioned, but is overly belligerent. thinking he might be intoxicated, the police try to arrest him, but Joe doesn't make it easy.  One officer who had enough pulls out a taser and lets him have it. Strangely, this only makes Joe angry, and he starts pushing the officers off him with greater force.  The first officer keeps up with the taser, and a second one joins in, then a third, but no matter what Joe won't go down. Eventually, after the fifth taser, Joe has a heart attack and dies. 

Later that day, the police are being interviewed by the coroner to figure out what happened. 

""You see,"" says the first officer says, ""We didn't want to kill him, but he kept resisting arrest!""

""Of course he resisted,"" replied the coroner. ""That's what happens when you run a current through a bad conductor!""",Joe and the Train,73

""I sat by myself, and watched the other children play..."" He says sadly.

""And why is that, Mohammed?""

""Because I asked Jack and Suzie if I could play with them and they both said no, because I'm different...""

Little Mohammed nods.

He spent *weeks* crafting, editing and honing the best limerick. Its pacing was fantastic and of course, was the dirtiest possible joke he'd ever made. 

After the results came in, he was disappointed to discover that he had come in 2nd place.

Discontent with the results, he tracked down the first place winner. 

It was a kind, little old lady. Surely, there must be a mistake. 

Dave drove to her place, knocked on the door and when opened he asked ""ma'am, did you recently win a dirty limerick contest""?

""Tee-hee"". She laughed, embarrassed and confirmed that she had indeed won the contest. 

""Ma'am, I must gear the limerick. I can't possibly believe that it was dirtier than what I wrote"" Dave pleaded.

""Oh no!"" She said embarrassed. ""I couldn't possibly repeat what I said. It's far too dirty and I would never say those words"" she said. 

""Well, I'm a pretty smart guy. I can piece it together. How about when there's a dirty word you just say ""duh da duh da"" and I'll figure out the rest"". 

She protested and protested but eventually gave in to Dave's request. 

With baited breath Dave waited and listened until finally she said:

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'

When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'

'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'

Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'

So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'

'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.

'No Kidding,' he said.

'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'

As bad as he as feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.

And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.

He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean.

So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick:

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!""

He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating.

Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??

His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!""",A good bar joke that always makes women laugh,2496

""Oh honey, it was awful,"" sighed Chris. ""Glen- you know Glen; Trish's husband?- he had a heart attack and dropped dead on the second hole.""

""My God,"" gasped his wife, ""That's terrible! Oh you poor thing.""

""Ay, you're telling me. It was awful. For the whole day it was 'hit the ball, drag Glen. Hit the ball, drag Glen.'""

A golfing couple were playing their routine course one afternoon. Feeling the peace and serenity of the day, the husband decided to confess his most regrettable action during their marriage.

""My dear, a few years back, I had an affair with my receptionist. I fired her shortly after. I'm telling you this because I felt guilty, and I know that you're the only one for me.""

She remains silent for the remainder of the hole. The husband fear that his marriage is lost. Suddenly, she begins to speak.

""I too, have something to admit.""

""Pray tell,"" says the husband, ""I'm sure it is not as bad as my sins.""

""Well,"" she says, ""In the years before we knew each other, I was a man. I've gone through a sex change.""

""WHAT?!"" roars the husband. ""AND YOU'VE BEEN HITTING FROM THE WOMEN'S TEE ALL THIS TIME?!""

Three men, an avid golf threesome, were considering adding a fourth to their weekly round. That day, a new woman overheard the guys talking about their golf game. She said, ""You know, I used to play on my golf team in college and I was pretty good. Would you mind if I joined you next week?""

One of the men said it would be okay, but they would be starting early -- at 6:30 a.m. They figured the early tee-time would discourage her.

The woman said this may be a problem, and asked if she could be up to 15 minutes late.

They rolled their eyes, but said okay.

She smiled and said, ""Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""

She showed up at 6:30 sharp, and beat all three of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. Back at the clubhouse, they congratulated her and invited her back the next week.. She smiled, and said, ""I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""

The next week she again showed up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she played left-handed. The three guys were incredulous as she still beat them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They were totally amazed.

The third week, the guys showed up with a new intensity to win. But this time, she was 15 minutes late, which made the guys irritable. On this day, the women played right-handed, and narrowly beat all three of them.

Back in the clubhouse, all three guys were shaking their heads. They had a couple of beers, and finally, one of the men asked her point blank, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushed, and grinned. ""That's easy,"" she said..""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous. I like to switch back and forth. When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I left in the morning for golf practice, I would pull the covers off him. If his Wee Duff was pointing to the right, I golfed right-handed; if it was pointed to the left, I golfed left-handed.""

One of the guys shot back, ""But what if it's pointing straight up?""

She said, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",A couple of sub-par jokes.,169

One day the chicken wakes up to this screaming and runs out of the farmer's house only to find the horse in a pit of mud sinking. 

Chicken says, “holy shit, how the fuck did you end up in here?” 

Horse explains “I’m eating a little food, a little hay…next thing you know I’m sinking in the mud.”

So what happens? Chicken runs over to the farmer's house and gets the farmers BMW. Now it’s an 850, all black, waxed to perfection, all leather interior – it’s fucking gorgeous. Hops in it, drives back over, ties a rope to the car and pulls his friend to safety. 

The horse is grateful and says “anytime you need me, I’ll be there."" 

So what happens? About a week later, same thing only this time it’s the chicken sinking in a pit of mud. 

Horse gallops over, sees his pal sinking in the mud, takes off to the farmer’s house but he can’t drive the BMW, runs back over, whips out his dick and the chicken climbs to safety.

Moral of the story – if you are hung like a horse, you don’t need a BMW to pick up chicks!

He decided that he was going to fulfill his lifelong desire to join a nudist colony.

After some research he found a nude beach that fit all of his criteria. On one beautiful Saturday he decided to go and visit. He arrived and approached the young lady behind the counter. He told her that it had always been his dream to be a nudist but he was very nervous. She told him that it was fine if he wanted to just try it out. He could start his clothes in the locker in the back and go on out to the beach and see if it suited him.

After stowing his clothes he headed out to the beach. He was still a little nervous so he found a bench where he could sit that was screened behind a few bushes and maybe he would have a little privacy as he observed the people around him.

Shortly after sitting down a group of young people started a game of volleyball on the beach. One of the players was an especially beautiful young woman that he couldn’t help but admire.

After the game everyone packed up to leave. As everyone headed back to the locker room the young woman he found so enticing approached him. She informed him that she couldn’t help but notice his admiring glances and she appreciated them. She then proceeded to give him the best blowjob of his life.

After finishing, he excitedly returned to the locker room. He grabbed his checkbook ran to the front and paid his membership dues on the spot. Before heading back to the beach he grabbed a cigar out of his locker and while strolling contentedly smoked his stogie.

After a few minutes he dropped his cigar. As he bent down to pick it up a beautiful blonde man came up behind him and mounted him. He frantically pushed the man off of him and ran back to the front desk. He demanded his money back and the lady behind the counter was happy to oblige, however, she wanted to know what had changed his mind. He was so excited a few minutes ago and now he just wanted to leave.

He turned to the lady, and said, “well at my age I get really excited once every few months (if you know what I mean!) On the other hand, I drop my cigar at least four times a day.”

The facility was well funded and nicer than the student expected for an institution housing patients with a range of disorders from violent schizophrenia to simple but unfortunate manic episodes in public and everything in between.

Upon arriving at the first patient’s room he could hear the growing thud as something repeatedly smacked against the wall. The student looked in through the window and saw the patient sitting on the floor by his bed and throwing a tennis ball against the wall. He even continued once the student entered and started to interview him, and although he answered slowly he responded relatively coherently. When asked what he would do if he got out he responded, “I want to play on the tennis court every day and be the best with the tennis ball that ever lived.” 

The graduate student made some notes for later and left to evaluate the second patient. 

The second patient’s room was also accompanied by a loud banging, although this time it was the sound of metal crashing on concrete. When the student looked through the window he saw the patient lifting the end of the bed, dropping it back to the floor multiple times before  dropping to the floor into a set of push ups. Upon being asked what his plans would be if he got out he said he wanted to be the best version of him he could be by competing in body building competitions. The graduate student wrote his notes and left the room. 

When he walked up to the third patient’s room it was completely quiet. He looked through the window and saw the patient in the corner of the room facing the wall. Thinking it was odd he decided the buzz in before entering. “Hello, I’m here to assess whether or not you’re stable enough to re-enter society.”

No response.

Cautiously the graduate student enters the room and again announces himself and is once more greeted by no response. Slowly and with his clipboard raised slightly in an attempt to protect himself in case anything went wrong he reached out and touched the patient. He turned around and was masturbating furiously with a coconut.
