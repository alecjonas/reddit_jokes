gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

post,5rffjd,2qh72,jokes,false,1485955448,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5rffjd/the_old_man_the_prince_and_the_fish/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was a prince of a certain land, who wanted to be a lowly fisherman when he grew up. But try as he could, he couldn't ever catch a single fish. He had tried many methods, including nets, spears, and traps, but all to no avail.

Furthermore, he was looked down upon by the rest of his family. While he should have been heir to the throne, he spent so much time trying to fish and failing that he was unsuited to the position. Furthermore, he had hardly wanted to become king anyway, and saw no real need for him to fill the position. Eventually, his family disowned him and he had to live his own life in a small hut.

One day, he met an old man by the lake shore, who was hungry and begging. The prince was down to his last few coins in his purse, but he gave them to the old man anyway. Not entirely out of altruism, mind you. He simply thought the old man would be able to have more use with the money than he would, considering what a failure he was at fishing.

The old man looked up at him and smiled, asking him ""I see you have a fishing net. Would you like to learn the secret to fishing?""

The prince, obviously just having given away absolutely everything, had little choice but to agree. So obviously, he did.

The old man told him, ""Come closer.""

The prince did so.

The old man whispered in his ear, ""Beyond the desert to the east is a huge ocean where the water is sweet and bubbling. Many fish swim in it, for there are plenty of nutrients in the water. You will surely get some fish there.""

The prince said, ""I understand,"" and started to set off.

The old man called after him, ""Wait, you'll need this!"" and gave the prince a fishing pole.

""This fishing pole is enchanted. It will draw fish towards it. You'll see.""

The prince scrounged up what he could for the journey. He took the last of the bread he had, some water from the lake, and left his hut abandoned.

He started crossing the desert. The blistering heat beat down on him. Halfway through the desert, he noticed someone was following him. He turned towards them and asked if they had brought any water with them.

""Yes, but you haven't kept up your interest payments. Pay me and I'll throw in the water as a free bonus. Otherwise, I guess you won't be needing your left hand.""

True to the old man's word, the fishing rod had indeed attracted a loan-shark (though the prince didn't realize this at the time). Not wanting to be killed or tortured or whatnot, the prince quickly thought up a plan.

""Yes, it's right here,"" he said, rummaging through his bag.

He took out the stale bread, which had hardened to a brick, and threw it at the shark, stunning him for a moment.

He turned and fled, running through the desert. His throat was parching, and every step he took against the slippery sands seemed to resist him all the way. Meanwhile, the loan-shark was calmly walking towards him.

Somehow, the prince managed to outrun the loan-shark. He made it to the edge of the bubbling ocean, as the old man had predicted. There, he saw a boat with some fishing supplies in them. He climbed in and started to figure out how to use the fishing rod.

True to the old man's word, the moment he cast his hook into the bubbling, fizzy waters, strange fish did indeed start biting almost immediately. He ended pulling fish after fish after hefty fish into his boat; so much so that he almost capsized. But in the end, he rowed back to shore, and thought that he should set up his home here.

He built a fire, cooked one of the fish, and took a bite out of it.

It was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted.

Several months passed, and the prince was able to live a happy life. Many travellers who passed by enjoyed his fish and paid a high price for it. So much so, that he eventually started up a trading company specializing in the fish. Then people wanted to be employed, so he had to build houses for them too. The prince's company soon turned into a town, into a city, and he had almost supreme authority.

One day, however, the aforementioned loan-shark arrived at the new palace. He was shown the way to the prince (who was basically now king but didn't realize it), and said ""Now that you're king, you can pay me all that money you owed! Remember, of course that the rate was normally 8% per month, but since you're a king, it's 8% per day!""

The prince, realizing what had happened, fell to his knees and cried:

""Is this the reel life? Is this just Fanta sea?
Caught in sand, lied; no escape from regality""","The old man, the prince, and the fish.",11

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

Only, one day, her period didn't come as expected. She thought it was probably nothing, but she was suspicious nonetheless. She went to the store and bought a pregnancy test, and, lo and behold, she was indeed pregnant. Well, shit.

Mick called up his mate, and told him the circumstances and repeated the question to him.

""Fookin hell, Mick!"" cried Paddy. ""Dat's simple it's a cuckoo.""

""Are you sure?""

""I'm fookin sure.""

Mick hung up the phone and told Chris, ""I'll go with cuckoo as my answer.""

""Is that your final answer?"" asked Chris.

""Dat it is.""

There was a long, long pause and then the presenter screamed, ""Cuckoo is the correct answer! Mick, you've won 1 million euros!""

The next night, Mick went round to Paddy's to buy him a drink.

So I mentioned to a super healthy facebook friend who is super slim and always posting sporty workout posts. Her weight loss advice was two words - ""Eat Butter.""

So I've been forcing myself to eat butter every day. First casually in food, then eat little chunks of it. But the weight was still piling on and getting worse. So even though it was making me sick I forced myself to eat a few spoonfuls a day, and eventually worked it up to two sticks a day. I got diarrhea regularly and I thought maybe it was working, but the scale and mirror told me it wasn't. Around six months in something changed in my body, and I stopped getting sick. Eating butter started to feel really comforting. I thought it was good, but the fat kept coming.

Then I'm crying about the weight a few days later, so I go back to the friend's post, and it actually said...

post,5rahwe,2qh72,jokes,false,1485892190,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5rahwe/square_testicles/,self.jokes,,"An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.
 
After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.
 
The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.
 
The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.
 
The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'
 
The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'
 
The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         
The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'
 
'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'
 
'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.
 
That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.
 
The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.
 
The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.
 
The president was happy to oblige.
 
The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'
 
The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'",Square Testicles,165

He later passes by a restaurant, and sees a couple arguing over manners. ""Forks and knives! Forks and knives, I tell you!"" He wondered what that meant, but kept repeating it to himself. He passes a homeless man who won the lottery, screaming 'YEEEES!' - so the alien, confused, remembers the emotion and the word.

As the streets emptied, the sky darkened, the alien enters an apartment building where it smelled and creaked with every step. He enters the first apartment, and sees an old man, drunk, lying on the floor. He didn't realize that the cops, who were called in, were behind him.

- Who did this? asked the cop
- ME ME ME! - screamed the alien
- Why did you do it?
- He stole my lollipop! - cried the alien
- With what? With a gun?
- Forks and knives! Forks and knives, I tell ya! -he answered

But I think the current political climate allows me to rehash it better. 

Enrique Peña Nieto, who is the Mexican President, is walking along the beach one day with the US President, Donald Trump, and prominent middle eastern human rights activist Malala Yousafzai. 

They happen to come across a lamp, and of course what anyone does when they discover a random lamp, they each give it a good rub and out pops an all-powerful genie. 

""3 Of you have awoken me! But I have only 3 wishes to give!"" Shouts the Genie. ""I will give each of you 1 wish, choose wisely!""

Enrique speaks up first, ""Oh magical Genie! I'd like Mexico to become a wealthy and strong nation! I want to be able to provide for our people and keep them safe from the Cartels! I want the economy in our country to be strong enough that families need not leave in order to find jobs. I want Mexican culture to flourish such that people are proud to be Mexican and can come home and celebrate with all of their friends and family!""

*Poof* - and just like that, the Mexican Peso surges past the US Dollar, and all the Mexican immigrants in America are rushing back to Mexico to work more lucrative jobs. Even now in fact, some Americans are illegally crossing the border trying to get jobs in the new world economic superpower. 

Malala goes next. ""Genie, please! I wish that there was peace in the middle east! That all of Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya... All of it! I wish that everyone could come to their senses and stop fighting for power, and instead work towards bettering their own societies. Education and equality for all, men, women, and children! Allow those of any  faith, be that Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, whatever they wish to believe - allow them to live harmoniously together and bring about a peaceful revolution to world. 

*Poof* - and just like that, all across the middle east a sense of calm crosses the land. People set aside their differences and come to understand one another. New glorious Multi-faith temples arise that attract pilgrims and tourists, and Schools and Universities spring up all over - creating a new intellectual hub of the world. People from all over are trying to get into these prestigious schools to learn from the greatest minds, and this open and safe mix of cultures creates a near utopia like region of the globe.

Last is Donald Trump. As he's checking his twitter and other online news feeds, he sees that America has fallen from great heights. All of the low-income workforce has left the country, and those with the means to leave the country have done so to move on to greener pastures. What's left is a mess of those too impoverished to leave or too proud or uneducated to see why they should.

Donald Trump takes a look at all of this, then turns to the genie and says, ""Well, so long as the Mexicans and Muslims are gone, I'll just take a Pepsi."" ","Enrique Peña Nieto, Malala Yousafzai, and Donald Trump are walking along a beach",5

Now the physicist was a bit of a connoisseur himself, and had managed to get his hands on all the four other quarks and their anti-quarks: he caught the ever-fleeting top quark near the last base camp on the Mount Everest, had discovered the appealing Charm quark in a beauty contest in Nevada, only barely managed to escape with the Strange quark from a sect of occult satanists and built his own bathyscape to collect a Bottom quark from the Mariana Trench.

He had long sought after the two remaining specimens to complete his collection, but to no avail. So he was delighted at first, but the quark collector was not ready to part with his ornaments.
Our physicist first tried to appeal to Rich's generosity, by pleading him to give him the up-quark. He was however rudely refused.

After weeks of pleading, begging, raging and convincing, he sent one final e-mail asking for either the top quark to be given or the down to be borrowed.
The next day, he received this email:

Eventually, the three begin to bicker about which of them is the most powerful and deadly.

The youngest suddenly gets up, and flies off into the night. Almost instantly, he returns in a huge flock of bats. His hands are covered in blood.

With a cackle, he points down the road.

""You see that abandoned coach down there? I slaughtered everyone in it! The driver, a nobleman and his wife, their three sons, and a guardsman! All dead in the blink of an eye!""

The second, older than the first, but younger than the last, scoffs. ""Child's play. Watch this."" And disappears with the wind. Even with his heightened senses, the younger could not follow his movements.

The second vampire reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished, and the gust of his speed knocked the youngest to the ground. His hands, mouth, and collar were caked with gore. He gestures towards a town in the distance. As the vampires watched, a building lit on fire, and fell onto another one. Soon, the entire town was alight, but no movement could be seen from the townsfolk at all.

""A hundred people in that town! All dead! Torn to shreds!""

The youngest was in awe, but the eldest of the three only chuckled amusedly.

""How cute."" He says.

The second looks almost indignant. ""I'd like to see you do better.""

The third lets out a malevolent chuckle.

""Very well.""

He gets up, dusts off his cloak, and puts his spectacles down on a rock.

He disappears with a **CRACK.** The other two vampires' jaws dropped at the impossible speed that the eldest flew at.

Another resounding **CRACK** filled the air as the eldest vampire returned to the cave. His cloak was in tatters. His clothes were disheveled. But most prominent was the blood. His entire body was covered in blood. Never would the other vampires imagine that so much blood could cling to one person.

The eldest lets out a sigh, and plops to the ground. He reaches for his glasses, and cleans them with what remains of his cloak.

The younger vampires look at each other, not sure whether to break the silence.

Finally, the youngest asks, ""So...?""

The elder vampire looks up slowly. He murmurs,

""You see that massive tree over there? The one with the widest trunk, as thick as a man is tall?""

Baffled, the youngest replied, ""...Yes?""

The eldest, sheepishly, continued.

""Well, I didn't.""","Three vampires sit in a cave in the black of night, sharing a drink, laughing, and generally having a good time that one would not associate with the undead.",1798

Freddy the Flea is laying out in the sun in Miami Beach, putting suntan lotion on his little flea arms, and on his little flea legs, when he notices his buddy Oscar stumbling down the beach.  

Oscar is a mess, he’s shivering, disheveled, and looks like 9 miles of bad road.
“Holy shit Oscar, what happened?” asks Freddy.  Oscar says, “You won’t believe it Freddy, I just rode all the way down from New York on some biker’s mustache, and I damned near froze my ass off”.

Freddy says, “Oscar, you dummy, that’s not the way to travel.  What you do is go to the airport, go in the ladies restroom, climb on a toilet seat, and when a nice stew from Miami Air sits down, you hop aboard, and fly first class”.

Oscar agrees to try this.  A couple weeks later, Freddy’s on the beach again, and here comes Oscar, looking even worse than before.  Freddy says, “Oscar, what happened, didn’t you do what I said?”

Oscar says, “Oh Freddy, I did just like you told me, I went in the women’s bathroom at the airport, and when a nice blonde stewardess sat down I jumped on.  It was so nice and warm and comfy that I just relaxed and fell asleep.  And the next thing I knew, I was on that same biker’s mustache!”.

that they're both sick of punching cows. They wander off, it's hard to rope them, they're BIG and dangerous, etc.

So they discuss what other animals they could herd and after much discussion Mike has the bright idea of herding chickens!

Yes, they are small, they stick together, and there's plenty of food for them to eat.

So they get a bunch of chickens and herd their flock all over the west.

One day, they enter Dodge City with their flock, but as they're going down main street, a bunch of cowboys start 
laughing at them and throwing eggs, etc.

So Mike says to Larry....I think we better get the flock out of Dodge..................z

Lo and behold, just before he hits the ground he turns into a mighty eagle and swoops away and alights once again on the top of the cliff as a man.

The remaining devotees are amazed and agrees that Buddha is a worthy deity, but that their deities will not be bested.

The third devotee, a Muslim, then proceeds to the edge of the cliff; he kneels down and begins his own prayers. He does so for several minutes and then stands up and turns and walks away from the edge.

Giving up and visibly upset, the woman finally got up from the couch and started for the door to meet her husband in the parking lot. The therapist stopped her and went for a bottle in his desk. ""I shouldn't do this, but I want to make sure you're happy and your marriage is happy"", he said as he handed here two blue pills, ""Here, take these Viagras. At breakfast, crush one up and put it in his coffee. I can promise you, his sex drive will go up and all will be fine again!"" 

The woman excitingly took the pills, thanked the therapist, and left.

The following week, she returned. ""How did it go?"" he asked. 

""Well, I did what you said. That morning, I crushed up his Viagra at the counter and sneaked it into his coffee."" the woman replied.

""And?"" urged the therapist.

""Well"" she said, with a smile on her face, ""he got this look in his eye, and grabbed me and we had some of the best sex in years!"". Her smile then went to a blank stare.

Tom was nailing the job interview, and then the interviewer said:
""Before I give you the job, I must make sure that you know what a Penguin is.""
""What's a penguin?"" asks Tom, only to be yelled at:
""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! GET OUT! AND NEVER COME BACK!""
Tom then comes back home with a sad look. His wife notices, and asks him:
""What happened?""
Tom replies:
I got denied the job because I didn't know what a penguin was.""
Then out of nowhere she starts screaming:
""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, AND I'M GOING TO SUE YOU!""
He goes to court the next day, and the judge asks him:
""What led you to being prosecuted?""
Tom replied:
""I got denied a job opportunity and got sued by my wife because I didn't know what a penguin was,"" only for the judge to yell:
""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! I'M GIVING YOU A LIFE SENTENCE!""
Then in a lonely cell, a guard asked him:
“How did you end up here, locked up forever?”
Tom replied, already losing his mind:
“I got denied a job opportunity, got sued by my wife and sentenced to jail because I didn’t know what a penguin was.”
Then the guard yells:
“YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! YOU DON’T DESERVE TO LIVE,” and shoots him without hesitation.
He appears at the Pearly Gates, and is asked:
“How did you end up dead?”
He replies:
“I got denied a job opportunity, sued by my wife, sentenced to jail and then shot at by a guard, all because I didn’t know what a penguin was.”
He then gets yelled at.
“YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! YOU’RE GOING TO HELL RIGHT AWAY!”
Then after entering hell, a demon asks him:
“How did you end up in hell?”
Tom replies:
“I got denied a job opportunity, sued by my wife, sentenced to jail, shot at by a guard, and then sent to hell, all because I didn’t know what a penguin was.”
The demon then starts yelling at him.
“YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN IS?! I’LL SEND YOU TO THE WORST PLACE OF HELL!!”
He then arrives at the hottest, darkest and most torturing place of hell. He was all alone, except for another man, curled up in a corner. This other man notices Tom and asks him:
“How did you end up here with me?”
Tom, already really scared, fearing of something even worse, started saying:
“I got denied a job opportunity, sued by my wife, sentenced to jail, shot at by a guard, sent to hell, and then sent here, ALL BECAUSE I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT A PENGUIN WAS!”
The other man calmly says:

The following day, John had sold all his tractors and tires, all his shiny ones and his dull ones, and even his old and new tractors too.  
  
He spent the money from selling all his tractors exploring the world. From Maimi to Cairo, London to Tokyo and every spot in between. After a year, John became bored of travelling, and decided he needed a refreshing pint.    
  
John returned to his local pub, and ordered a nice cool one. As he sipped at his frothy beverage, a group of men in the corner began to smoke. They were pumping noxious gas into the air like there was no tomorrow, and soon the room was thick with smog and people were choking on the harsh cloud.

Anyway, I have never approached the subject with her. I kind of think deep down I don't really want to know the truth.

I hid behind my car which I knew would give me a good view of the whole street so I could see which car she got out of on her return.

""Sisters, welcome to Heaven. In a moment I will let you all though the pearly gates, 
but before I may do that, I must ask each of you a single question. Please form a 
single-file line."" And they do so.
St. Peter turns to the first Nun in the line and asks her ""Sister, have you ever touched a penis?""
The Sister Responds ""Well... there was this one time... that I kinda sorta... touched one with the
tip of my pinky finger...""
St. Peter says ""Alright Sister, now dip the tip of your pinky finger in the Holy Water, and you may 
be admitted."" and she did so.
St. Peter now turns to the second nun and says ""Sister, have you ever touched a penis?"" 
""Well.... There was this one time... that I held one for a moment...""
""Alright Sister, now just wash your hands in the Holy Water, and you may be admitted"" and she does so.
Now at this, there is a noise, a jostling in the line. It seems that one nun is trying to cut in front

We're just sitting on the rocks smoking some joints, meanwhile down on the sand there's girls in bikinis laying on their towels getting some sun.  We see this guy walking along the beach talking to the girls.  

He's wearing a big colorful Jamaican rasta hat and has this huge ridiculous red feather in his left hand.  As he approaches each of the girls on the beach he says something to them.  The girls either shake their head no and he moves along to the next girl or they stand right up, go into the bushes with him, and then come back in a few minutes and resume sunbathing.

Eventually he gets close enough that we can hear the conversation. He strolls up to a group of three girls. He says to the first girl ""Hey... me tickle your clit with me feather?"" and the girl, a little taken aback, says  ""I'm sorry what did you say?"" the guy says  ""Typical Island weather!""  and the girl just kind of smiles at him awkwardly. 

He walks up to the second girl and says ""Hey! Me tickle your clit with me feather?"" now this girl is just aghast and disgustedly says ""What the fuck did you just say to me?"" and the guy smiles and says ""Typical Island weather!"" The girl thinks about that for a second and says ""Oh yeah I suppose so..."" 

Then he walks up to the third girl and says ""Hey, me tickle your clit with me feather?"" the girl squints her eyes at him for a moment then laughs, smiles, says ""Yeah sure!""

They go off into the bushes for a few minutes when they come out the girl goes and sits back down on her towel satisfied and the guy keeps walking down the beach. Then this other guy walks up to him. Big fucking Australian guy.

He says ""Oi mate! I seen what just happened there... tell me your secret!"" 

So the guy with the feather says ""First, simply say your line on the ladies. Then, if she doesn't like it just make a comment about the weather!""

The Australian guy says ""Alright alright.."" and walks over to a girl laying in the sand.

He says ""Oi! I want to fuck you SO HARD!"" 

The girl is shocked and says ""Excuse me?! What the fuck?!"" and the Australian guy grins and says ""LOOKS LIKE RAIN!""",Right by the beach... [nsfw] [long],1

He was an old man, who walked with the aid of a cane, and who wasn't able to fetch his hat. Across the street, a young man saw what was happening, rushed over and grabbed the hat. He then returned it to the priest.

""I don't think I could have retrieved my hat by myself,"" the priest said. ""Thank you very much!"" He then placed his hand on the man's shoulder and said, ""May God bless you."" 

""I've been blessed by the priest,"" the young man thought.  ""This must be my lucky day!""

Right then and there, he decided to go to the racetrack. In the first race he noted a horse named 'High Hat' at 20 to 1. He bet £50 and, sure enough, the horse came in first, netting him £1000. In the second race, a horse named 'Trilby' was at 30 to 1, so he bet all his money on it, and it came in first, as well.  He continued like that for some time, betting on horses with hat names.

At the end of the day the man returned home to his wife. She asked him where he'd been, and he told her. 
""So where's the money?"" she said. 
""I lost it all in the ninth race. I bet on a horse named Chateau and it lost."" 
""You fool, 'chateau' is a house, 'chapeau' is a hat!"" exlaimed his wife. 
""It doesn't matter,"" he said, ""the winner was some Spanish horse named Zucchetto.""

""I have literally fucked the sexuality out of me. I can't do this anymore."" He grows wings and goes to heaven. 

Satan opens the third and final door and sees nothing has changed. The weed is still in place, the pipes still where they were. Paper is flat; not rolled up. Satan then spots the guy in the corner, in the fetal position, shaking and shivering with horns grown out of his head. 

Satan asks ""what in the hell happened here!?""

post,5qz35u,2qh72,jokes,false,1485756891,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5qz35u/chinese_torture/,self.jokes,,"A young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost""",Chinese torture,65
