At the first hole, Peter goes first. Since he just got done at the driving range, he was thoroughly warmed up and had an excellent drive. His ball landed on the green of a par 4 about 30 feet from the hole. Next was John, and not being quite as good as Peter, he landed his ball a bit short of the green, but still a very good drive. Now it was Jesus's turn. Jesus was still using his old clubs, and he hadn't been golfing as much and Peter and John. He swung, and as soon as his club hit the ball, he knew it was a bad shot. His ball was flying straight for the water trap on the right side. Just when it was a foot off the water a trout jumped, hitting the ball strait up in the air. At the peak of the balls upward trajectory, an eagle flew by grabbing the ball with its talon's as it flew toward the green. Once over the green, it dropped the ball about 4 feet from the hole. As the ball landed a squirrel, nervous of the eagle, decided to dash to safety on the other side of the green, running into the ball on the way and knocking it into the hole. It was Jesus's first hole in one. Peter and John were speechless. Jesus turned to his partner and said ""Thank you, Father.""","Peter, John, and Jesus are at the driving range",3

So they loaded up John's minivan and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. 'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained, 'and I'm afraid the neighbours will talk if I let you stay in my house.’ 'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.’ The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of golf. But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the golf weekend. He dropped in on his friend Ken and asked, 'Ken, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our golf holiday in Scotland about 9 months ago?’ 'Yes, I do.' Said Ken. 'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?’ 'Well, um, yes!,' Ken said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have to admit that I did.’ 'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?’ Ken's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy.

He reaches a river with a drivable bridge, but much to his surprise the river has flooded over, covering the bridge completely. He stops his car before the river, trying to figure out what to do.


He spots an old house a little bit into the woods. On the porch, a hillbilly holding a sawed of shotgun is rocking back and fourth on a chair, a piece of wheat in his mouth. The driver exits his vehicle and approaches the hillbilly. ""Excuse me sir,"" he asks the hillbilly. ""The river nearby has flooded and I am unable to cross, do you know an alternate way across the river?"" The hillbilly thinks for a while, then finally says ""Well sir, the water ain't that deep ya see? Probably just a few centimeters high above the bridge. I'd reckon with a SUV like that, you'd make it to the other side easy."" The man thanks the hillbilly and goes back to his vehicle.


He starts it up and starts driving. First the bottom of his tires touch the water. Expecting this to be the deepest depth, he continues. Unfortunately, when his vehicle is halfway across it is almost fully submerged. The man escapes through the window, barely making it out alive. 


Furious he returns to the hillbilly's home. ""You liar! That river was plenty deep, I lost my vehicle and I almost died!"" The hillbilly looks quite confused, and replies ""Well that sure is strange sir! For the ducks, the water is only waist deep!",The Hillbilly and the Duck,5

Being bear country he always went in depth with the bear portion of the training.
He would always say ""Make sure you have a whistle. A whistle being blown will scare the bear off and take care of 80% of your bear concerns. If the whistle doesn't work you will need bear mace... one spray into the eyes of a bear and you will be fine.""
The group finished up the class with the recent graduate and a guide picked them up from the camp store area where they all had fresh orange whistles around their necks and bear spray on their backpacks.

The guide heads the group up the mountain and tells them to watch their step as the pass some bear poop.

Would you mind if I took the car for a spin?  It would help me feel young again!”  The driver, being devoted and willing to do anything for the pope agreed, but asked where he should ride if His Holiness was going to be driving.  “Hop in the back, and let me be your driver for this trip!”  Laughing nervously, the chauffer agreed and hopped in the back of the Mercedes.  The pope cranked it up and zoomed away, not accounting for the horsepower in the Mercedes engine.
 
Down the road, Officer Murray was enjoying his first day on the job and sees a white Mercedes zoom by, cutting lanes, and making an illegal left hand turn.  Excitedly, he turns on his lights and prepares for his first traffic stop.  Calling in the stop, he walks up to the driver’s window, hand on his holstered weapon and ready for anything.  Stopping short of the window, with his “Driver’s license and registration please!” ready on his lips, he freezes and slowly backs away.  He reaches for his radio and calls his superior:

The son comes home in the afternoon. Father asks him, “So, you were at school today, right?”

Son: “Yeah.”

Detector: ""A dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun
In the wild purple of the glow'ring sun,
Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud
The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one,
Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.
The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed
With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,
Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.
Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,
They leave their trenches, going over the top,
While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,
And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,
Flounders in mud. O Jesus, make it stop! ""

Son: “OK, OK, I was in a cinema.”

Detector: ""I knew a simple soldier boy
Who grinned at life in empty joy,
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,
And whistled early with the lark.
In winter trenches, cowed and glum,
With crumps and lice and lack of rum,
He put a bullet through his brain.
No one spoke of him again.
You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye
Who cheer when soldier lads march by,
Sneak home and pray you'll never know
The hell where youth and laughter go. ""

Son: “Alright, I went for a beer with my friends.”

Father: “What?! At your age, I wouldn’t touch alcohol!“

Detector: ""Does it matter? -losing your legs?
For people will always be kind,
And you need not show that you mind
When others come in after hunting
To gobble their muffins and eggs.
Does it matter? -losing you sight?
There’s such splendid work for the blind;
And people will always be kind,
As you sit on the terrace remembering
And turning your face to the light.
Do they matter-those dreams in the pit?
You can drink and forget and be glad,
And people won't say that you’re mad;
For they know that you've fought for your country,
And no one will worry a bit. ""

Mother laughs: “Ha ha ha, well, he really is your son!”

Detector: ""The rank stench of those bodies haunts me still
And I remember things I'd best forget.
For now we've marched to a green, trenchless land
Twelve miles from battering guns: along the grass
Brown lines of tents are hives for snoring men;
Wide, radiant water sways the floating sky
Below dark, shivering trees. And living-clean
Comes back with thoughts of home and hours of sleep.
To-night I smell the battle; miles away
Gun-thunder leaps and thuds along the ridge;
The spouting shells dig pits in fields of death,
And wounded men, are moaning in the woods.
If any friend be there whom I have loved,
God speed him safe to England with a gash.
It's sundown in the camp; some youngster laughs,
Lifting his mug and drinking health to all
Who come unscathed from that unpitying waste:
(Terror and ruin lurk behind his gaze.)
Another sits with tranquil, musing face,
Puffing bis pipe and dreaming of the girl
Whose last scrawled letter lies upon his knee.
The sunlight falls, low-ruddy from the west,
Upon their heads. Last week they might have died
And now they stretch their limbs in tired content.
One says 'The bloody Bosche has got the knock;
'And soon they'll crumple up and chuck their games.
'We've got the beggars on the run at last!'
Then I remembered someone that I'd seen
Dead in a squalid, miserable ditch,
Heedless of toiling feet that trod him down.
He was a Prussian with a decent face,
Young, fresh, and pleasant, so 1 dare to say.
No doubt he loathed the war and longed for peace,
And cursed our souls because we'd killed bis friends.
One night he yawned along a haIf-dug trench
Midnight; and then the British guns began
With heavy shrapnel bursting low, and 'hows'
Whistling to cut the wire with blinding din.
He didn't move; the digging still went on;
Men stooped and shovelled; someone gave a grunt,
And moaned and died with agony in the sludge.
Then the long hiss of shells lifted and stopped.
He stared into the gloom; a rocket curved,
And rifles rattled angrily on the left
Down by the wood, and there was noise of bombs.
Then the damned English loomed in scrambling haste
Out of the dark and struggled through the wire,
And there were shouts and eurses; someone screamed
And men began to blunder down the trench
Without their rifles. It was time to go:
He grabbed his coat; stood up, gulping some bread;
Then clutched his head and fell.
I found him there
In the gray morning when the place was held.
His face was in the mud; one arm flung out
As when he crumpled up; his sturdy legs
Were bent beneath bis trunk; heels to the skye. """,A dad brought a lie detector home .,6

He would break a few eggs when collecting them from the pen. He would pull the cow's udder to hard and they would run, prompting him to start a chase. He would put unwanted objects in the pigs trough, like pieces of random metal or huge wood, which almost killed one of his pigs once... 

But, he would perfectly shear his sheep. Not because he was inherently good at it, but because one of his sheep, named Carl, was helping him. At first he was really bad, cut off some skin on the first few tries. When Carl first came to the farm and saw him, he got scared that he might bleed to death if he were next, so he took it upon himself to teach the man the ways of shearing. Now farmer John was an expert at it and Carl felt proud. 

But when Carl saw how the other animals were being treated, he thought ""If I can teach this poor man how to shear, maybe I can help him with the other animals as well!""

So Carl did try. But it wasn't enough... No matter how easy he taught him, how simple the instructions, the poor farmer made it worse. He accidentally cut off a nipple on his cow. He did get all the eggs without breaking them, but including fertilised ones, and he found out the hard way in the kitchen. And the pig's trough was filled with Doritos and mountain dew for some damn reason. 

Carl was dumbfounded. He asked the farmer how can be learn to be a good shearer when he can't learn how to be good at everything else?

He answered ""I used to work in a barber's shop."" 

The next day. Farmer John woke up to an empty farm. All the animals had left. Back at his living room he saw a picture left on the centre table. It was all his animals in a nice, fancy farm. They looked all happy and there was Carl with a big grin on his face. There were words written on the back:

""You've been a mentor and a great support."" says the younger horse. ""Whatever you need, it would be my honor.""

""I fear that, with my performance not what it once was, I may not leave much of a legacy behind."" Responds the older stallion. ""If I lose again tomorrow, I'm afraid it might be off to the glue factory for me. If I were to win against such an astounding young talent as yourself, though. Why, I'd be legendary, they'd let me retire to a green pasture to live out my days. Could you find it within you to throw the race so that an old man might live a long life?""

The young horse ponders this for a moment, ""I appreciate your fears, friend, but I have no way of knowing what's in store for me. If I throw the race tomorrow, who's to say I'll get another chance to prove myself, I may end up in obscurity.""

After observing all of this, the mutt interjects ""So you'd be willing to let this old horse, your mentor, be unceremoniously killed so that you might protect your record? How selfish can you be?""

post,585nwg,2qh72,jokes,false,1476817589,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/585nwg/the_island_of_trid/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, in the middle of the ocean, there was the Island of Trid.

Most of the Island of Trid was covered by a large mountain. On this mountain lived a Giant. The Giant did not allow Trids on his mountain. If a Trid dared to climb onto the mountain, the Giant would pick them up and kick them into the ocean where they usually drowned. 

The Trids were very fruitful and multiplied greatly, thus the population had grown extremely large. Every square inch of the island, except for the mountain, was crowded with Trids.

The Trids spent their days crowded together dreaming of the open space available on the ever visible mountain. Every few days, a Trid would decide he couldn't stand it any longer and would proceed to climb the mountain, and the Giant would kick the Trid into the ocean. 

One day a traveling Rabbi visited the Island of Trid. Despite their overcrowded conditions, the Trids were extremely generous to him.

The Rabbi decided to return the favor and go plead the Trids' case to the Giant. ""Surely the Giant can be convinced to share some of the mountain with you,"" the Rabbi explained.

The Trids were horrified. ""Please don't go, Rabbi"", the Trids implored,""The Giant will kick you into the ocean and you will surely drown.""

The rabbi was stubborn and insisted he talk to the Giant. The Trids sent out every boat they had. They formed a ring around the island, so that they would be able to rescue the Rabbi.

The Rabbi started walking towards the mountain, but there was no sign of the Giant.

He walked through the foothills, and there was no sign of the Giant.

He started up the slopes of the mountain, further than any Trid had ever been. Still no sign of the Giant.

Finally he reached the summit of the mountain. There the Giant was waiting for him. The Rabbi asked, ""Tell me Giant, why have you allowed me to climb to the top of the mountain, without kicking me off the moment I started climbing?""

The Giant chuckled saying, ""Don't you know? Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""",The Island of Trid,10

The plumber comes over and quickly fixes the sink. The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, ""How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck."" But he pays it anyways.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""

He had no idea what they meant, so when he got to school and the teacher asked if there were any questions, he raised his hand. When he was called upon he asked: 

""What is Stark Sky?"" 

His teacher screamed at him to go to the principal. 

The principal asked him why he was there and he said:

""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me here.""

""What are the words,"" the principal asked.

 ""Stark Sky,"" replied the boy. The principal freaked out and expelled him and told him to get out of the school. 

At home is mother asked him why he had been expelled. 
“Well,” he answered. ""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me.""

""Is that it? What on Earth were the words?"" his mother asked.

""Stark Sky,"" he said. 

His mom turned red and yelled at him to go up to his room and wait for his father. 

When his dad got home he went upstairs and sat on the end of his son’s bed.

""So I hear you got into a lot of trouble today. Tell me what happened."" 

The boy answered, ""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant, so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me. When I got home mom asked me what had happened and I told her everything and she asked me what the words were. When I told her she sent me up here to wait for you.""

“Well, son, what are the words?""

""Stark Sky."" the boy replied. 

His father exploded and kicked him out of the house. 

As he was wandering around he ran into some friends. They crowded round the boy.

""What's going on, man? We heard you got expelled and your dad kicked you out!"" 

So the boy said,"" When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me. When I got home my mom asked me what had happened and I told her everything and she asked me what the words were. When I told her she sent me up to my room to wait for my dad. He asked me what happened and after I told him everything he asked me the words and when I told him he kicked me out."" 

""Wow, what are the words?"" his friends asked. 

""Stark Sky,"" he replied. 

All of his friends jumped him and started beating him up until a bum came by and scared them off. 

""I just saved your life,” said the bum. “Tell me why they were all beating you up."" 

The boy slowly picked himself up off the floor and turned to face the bum.

""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant, so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office.

I ran into my friends and they asked me why I had been expelled and kicked out of my house and I told them everything and then they asked what the words were. When I told them, they beat me up."" 

""So, what on Earth are the words?"" the bum asked. 

""I don't know if I should say,” said the boy. 

""Come on. I just saved your life, don't be ungrateful,"" the bum remarked. 

""Okay, okay. The words were Stark Sky."" 

The bum freaks out and starts beating the boy up until a cop comes along and breaks it up. The bum ran off leaving the shaken boy to be helped to his feet by the police officer. The cop asks the boy what happened. 

“Well, when I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office.

“What were the words?"" pried the police officer. 

The boy replied, ""Stark Sky."" 

Appalled, the cop put the boy into hand cuffs, beat him up and took him to jail. 

The next day the boy appeared before a judge. The judge asked him for his story. 
The boy answered, "" When I was on my way to school yesterday, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office.

Then a cop came by and broke it up and after explaining the story to him he asked what the words were and when I told him he handcuffed me and took me to jail."" 

""What were the words, Boy?"" demanded the Judge. 

The boy said, ""Haven't you been paying any attention? I'm not going to tell you."" 

The judge informed him that he would be found in contempt of court if he didn't answer him and say the words. Reluctantly, he obeyed. 

""Stark Sky."" 

The judge was outraged and sentenced him to ten years in jail. 

Everyone was curious about their new cell mate, so they asked him what he was in for.

""Well, when I was on my way to school one day, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me.

The next day I had to go to court and the judge asked me what happened and I told him everything and then he asked me the words and when I told him he gave me ten years."" 

Everyone was amazed at the story and asked what the words were. Sighing deeply the boy replied, ""Stark Sky.” 

He spent the next ten years getting beaten up. 

The day he was released he met a beautiful woman. 

""You look like you've had a very rough time. What happened?"" 

The man coughed and cleared his throat. ""When I was on my way to school one day, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal’s office.

All of my cell mates asked me what the words were and I just sighed and told them. I have spent the last ten years getting beat up."" 

""Oh that is just awful!"" the woman exclaimed. ""What were the words?"" 

""Do you think I'm stupid?!"" exploded the man. ""I'm not going to tell you the words."" 

""Oh come on,"" the woman cooed. ""I won't do anything to you."" 

""Oh, alright. The words were Stark Sky."" 

""Stark Sky?"" asked the woman with her eyes lit up. 

""Yes,"" the man replied. 

""You see that hotel across the street? If you meet me there in one hour I will tell you the meaning of Stark Sky."" 

The man was ecstatic. He was finally going to learn what Stark Sky meant after all of this time. Once the hour was up, he set off for across the street in a hurry. As he stepped off the curb, he was hit by a bus. 

The moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing the street.

We lived in a penthouse apartment in a high rise, and wanted for nothing. But one day, I noticed that she started acting a little strange. She was secretive and odd. Fearing she was upset, I decided that one day I'd leave work early to come home and surprise her. When I arrived, she was naked in our bed with a man's clothes next to hers on the floor. I lost it. I searched for him all over the apartment, the two of us yelling and screaming at each other the whole time. 

""After awhile, I gave up, and grabbed a cigarette to ease my stress. I walked out onto the balcony to smoke it, and I noticed a pair of hands holding onto the edge. Realizing I found the bastard, I furiously started stomping on his hands and tried to get him to let go. He's yelling for me to stop, but wouldn't let go. So finally, out of desperation, I unplugged the refrigerator and tossed it off the edge, knocking him from the ledge and crushing him. Just then, I collapsed to the ground and died of a heart attack from the stress.""

St. Peter looks at the first man and says, ""Oh, my son, that's terrible. Please, come into heaven."" So the first man walks in. 

The second man approaches the gates and St. Peter asks him to tell his tale. The man says, ""Well, I was an easy going guy. Single, sort of a ladies man, but a good person. I worked hard and lived in a high rise below a nice couple, and minded my own. I liked to keep my physique in shape, so I worked out constantly. One day, I decided to do some pull ups from the balcony above me. I heard the couple upstairs arguing, but I didn't want to intrude, so I kept doing what I was doing. Then, suddenly, the husband starts screaming and stomping in my hands! I yelled up to me, 'stop, stop! It's me!' but he didn't. Then, all of a sudden, a refrigerator is flung off the balcony, knocking loose my grip, sending me tumbling off the edge, and into the ground, where the fridge crushed and killed me.""

St. Peter says to the second man, ""Oh, my son, you did not deserve that. Please, come into heaven."" So the second man walks in.

curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from other boys and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning Johnny described everything to his mother.""

""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off
most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.""

""He was getting sick too because pretty soon both of them started
panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really HOT.""

""Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. HONEST! anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!""

""Anyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head
off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again.""

""Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on
it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them.""

""After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her
boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel... I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. And by golly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again.""

""I guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something.
This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.""",How to Kill an Eel,4

But they were affecting his life in many ways, especially his love life.  No one likes to be with someone who farts all the time, so when Adam met the love of his life, he knew he had to give up beans. 

A few years down the road and everything in his life is going great.  He has a great job, a lovely wife, a kid on the way, who could ask for more.  This day however, was a bit ruffer, and while on his way home from work, his car broke down, next to a small diner. To combat this stress Adam was feeling, he stepped into the diner and ate a bowl of beans, knowing it would be a few hours before his wife came to get him, giving him time to pass the gas. 

Well his wife showed up early, too damn early, and the entire drive home Adam had to hold his fart in while feeling his body slowly adding mass to this fart. When they arrived home, Adam's wife put a blindfold over his eyes and said, ""no peeking"".  She guided him inside very slowly while Adam.held in his fart, but the phone rang before she could pull off the mask.  She went to answer it, and adam knew this was his chance.  He pulled his cheeks apart to silence the fart, and he let the fart free.  The sound of it leaving was like a gust of wind. The smell was atrocious.  Adam started flapping his arms to try to disperse the gas before his wife returned. Luckily, it had disapated before she came back.  She grabbed Adam, pulled off his blindfold, and everyone Adam knew jumped up and said, ""SURPRISE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!""",Adam loved beans.,1

So they left the first man and headed up the road and the houses were getting bigger and bigger, eventually they stopped at a massive house. Again they went up to the door and were greeted by another ugly looking woman.

The angel replied ""Because you cheated on your taxes that one time remember."" The man remembered and the angel and the last man were on their way again. 

Walking up the road, the houses getting bigger and bigger finally they stopped at a house the size of a shopping mall and they approached the front door. The last man was anxious to meet the woman who he would be spending eternity with and they were greeted at the door by the most beautiful woman anyone had ever seen.

Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they had to take part in an ancient trial. If just one of them could pass, they'd all be set free, but if all three failed, they'd be killed and eaten. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went their separate ways to gather fruits.

The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explained the trial to him: ""You must shove the fruits up your ass one at a time without any expression on your face whatsoever, or you'll be eaten.""

The first apple went in... then after a bit of trouble, a second. But as he attempted to work the third apple in, he winced out in pain, so he was taken aside.

The second prisoner arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him, he thought to himself, ""This should be easy!"" And so he began: 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was taken aside with the first prisoner.

The first prisoner gave the second prisoner a quizzical look as he came over to join him. 
""What happened?! I thought you had it!""
""I did too, but I saw the third guy coming back with an armful of pineapples.""",Cannibals and Fruit,16

St Peter says, ""OK you may enter and enjoy the streets of gold and walk with God""

Second nun, same question. She gives him the answer of ""I partied a lot when I was younger and enjoyed sex but I later married and have birth to three beautiful children. When my husband died, I went to the church and became a nun to show my discipline for God!""

St Peter lets her into heaven so she may be in peace and harmony.

The third nun gets to the front of the line and very ecstatically starts saying how ""I'm such a good woman, I never had sex, I gave myself to God, became a member of the church and a nun before I was 18!! I'm the one who deserves it all!""

St Peter looks at her, nods, and indeed she was pure.  But he tells her that ""God gave you a vagina to use it!""

You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end.
