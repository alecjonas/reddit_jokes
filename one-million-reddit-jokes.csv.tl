I've come here because this is the only place where anyone will listen to me. So, here's my dilemma: I'm standing on a bridge, above some railroad tracks, and tied to the tracks, just behind me, is my own mother! This wouldn't be too out of the ordinary for her, as she often gets overly dramatic and feigns suicide, but she always checks to make sure the tracks are out of service first. This time, I see a train coming down the tracks! Now, next to me on the bridge is long lever, which allows me to vastly increase the force I can apply to a large object, and in this case the large object is a mechanism that moves the train to a different set of tracks. I can pull this lever, and save my mother, but I feel like you should know some things about her, first. She used to beat me. Well, she beat me once, but it was really bad. It wasn't for no reason. Admittedly, I was up to a little trouble. You see, I wanted an allowance, but my parents never gave me one, even though I offered to do all sorts of chores, even untie mom from the train tracks every time she got dramatic. But still, no allowance. So, I had to turn to some more dubious extra-curricular activities if I was going to have any money. I know what you're thinking, but selling drugs was far too risky for me. I found a much more reliable way to get some fast cash. First, I split my soul in two and made a Horcrux (yes, I murdered...we'll get to that), then, I sold that piece of my soul to Mammon, who gave me the power to instantly know a persons net-worth just from looking at them, along with ten billion dollars. Then I realized that Mammon paid me for a whole soul; that sucker didn't even know what half a soul looked like! So, I went ahead and made eight more Horcruxes, because fuck Voldemort, that's why, and I sold them all to different demons at full price. I even got Beelzebub to grant me the power to look homeless at will. I didn't think it would be particularly useful at the time, but it came in handy. People don't look at the homeless. Anyway, I was flying pretty high on my Horcrux money, until it all disappeared from my account. Apparently demon money does that. That happened around  the same time that my mom noticed the ants, and this is where I should mention my murders. I wasn't actually going to kill people, I had some moral compass back then, but I decided that I could kill ants. Surely they don't matter. But that's the problem. For the soul to split, you have to really feel the brutal act of murder in a way that killing an ant just doesn't illicit. So, I began keeping ant-farms in my room, studying their movements, learning their social structures. I became intimately familiar with every part of ant life. I really knew what it was like to be an ant, a cog in a machine so much bigger than one's self, to live for the colony and keep no identity. And once I had achieved oneness with my ant friends, I killed them. I killed them all. Well, 11 of them. The first two were practice. Once I no longer needed to murder, I just kept the rest of the ants in my room. They were still cool to look at, but I got lazy taking care of them and they started getting out. That's when my mom went in my room and found all of the ant-farms on top of dark-arts books and deposit slips from the Great Bank of Satan. Busted. That's when she beat me. But, you have to understand, this wasn't a normal beating with a belt or something. She used a crucifix and kept shouting ""GET OUT OF HIM, GHOST!"" I had no idea what Himghost was or how I got in it, but I guess it just means trouble. So, yeah, after that I left home, penniless because my demon money vanished, and with no place to live. Luckily, I was able to look the part thanks to Beelzebub, and Mammon's trick helped me pick out which people to ask for money. It turns out, I could use it for net-worth, or just how much cash was in your pocket. I used to freak people out by saying ""Come one, I know you have twenty-one dollars and thirty-two cents! You can spare one of those fives."" That almost always worked, and I actually made a pretty decent living for myself that way. Which brings us to today, with me, standing on the bridge with the lever that will save my mom if I pull it. So I pulled it. My mom and I have a complicated history, but I'll always help her out in a pinch. What's really been bugging me is: should I have really felt that bad about killing those ants?",I have a moral dilemma...,0

When he stepped into the court, he saw the baker in the plaintiff's bench. The milkman went into the defendant's bench and waited for the judge to speak.

   ""Baker, what is your complaint?"" asked the judge.

""Well, here's the situation. Everyday I order a pound of milk. But, whenever *I* go to weigh it, it's always less than a pound. I want to be compensated for all of the money that was stolen from me by that filthy milkman!""

The judge turned to the milkman and asked, ""Well, how do you plead?""

""Not guilty, your honor."" 

""Is it possible that your scale you use to weigh is not correct?"" asked the judge.

""Well, your honor, I am not the richest man so I can't afford the most expensive scale. But I am positive that what I use is satisfactory.""

The judge thought for a moment and then asked, ""Is it possible that the stones you use as the counterbalance on the scale are slightly off?""

""I don't use stones."" The milkman said plainly.

""So, what *do* you use?"" The judge asked, exasperated.

Having admired her from afar, he finally gets up the courage to talk to her.

Everything goes better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date the following Saturday evening. 

Saturday night, the young man arrives at her house with a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates. 

To his surprise, she answers the door in nothing but a towel. 'I'm sorry' she exclaims, 'I'm running a bit late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you while I finish dressing. 
    
I should warn you though, they are both deaf mutes.""

With this, she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and 
promptly disappears. 

As you can imagine, this is a little uncomfortable as both of the parents are completely silent.

Dad is sitting in his armchair watching football on TV and Mum is busy knitting. 

After about 10 minutes of complete silence, Mum jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her knickers and pours a glass of water over her backside.

Just as sudden, Dad launches himself across the room, bends her over the couch and takes her from behind. 

He then sits back in his chair and balances a match stick in front of his eye. 

The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. 

 After a further ten minutes, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready for the evening. 

The date is a complete disaster.

The young man is totally pre-occupied by the antics of the young lady's Parents. 

At the end of the date, sensing something is seriously wrong, the young lady asks the young guy, 

""What's the matter? What have I done wrong?"" 

""No, it's not you"", he replied, ""It's just that the strangest thing happened whilst I was waiting for you and I'm still shocked. Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties and throws a glass of water on her  backside.Then, as if that wasn't enough, your father races from his chair, leans her over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back and places a match stick by his eye"".

I was kinda struggling with ways to put them into words because these are ""feelings you're supposed to feel"", right? Then I let it flow in me. I tried to feel it. The best way I could put it was food.

Like is sorta similar to pasta or fish &amp; chips for me. I like them. I enjoy them and I don't mind them showing up on my plate. Sometimes, I even crave them but I don't LOVEEE them. I just enjoy them and wanna eat them once in a while. That's it.

Love is kinda like pizza. If I can, I'd eat them everyday. I might get bored of it for a while, maybe curious to try other food. But I'll always come back to it. If I land my dream job, I'd order a pizza to celebrate it. If I lose my pet cat, I'd get myself a slice of pizza. After a long day at work, I'd get myself a piece of pizza as treat. It's the food I'd want to spend my best and worst days with. I'd mourn for the closure of a pizza joint, because I care about pizzas.....because I'm in love with pizza.

But then again, I can eat pizzas legally. I can't say the same for humans. So I suppose it's not exactly the best analogy.",Someone asked me the difference between like and love,0

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars! 
Jerry said, We've got to give it back.
Sally said, ""Finders keepers."" She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.
The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?
Sally said, ""No.""
Jerry said, ""She's lying. She hid it up in the attic.""
Sally said, ""Don't believe him, he's getting senile.""

They check in to the most expensive suite in the most expensive hotel in town. This suite is that posh that it has 2 double bedrooms joined by a connecting door. After relaxing a while they head down to the bar where Paddy orders the most expensive bottle of finest Scots Whisky, Mick goes for the a vintage bottle of Champagne which they polish off before dinner. In the dinning room Mick orders whatever is most expensive on the menu, Paddy orders everything on the menu. 2 hours later they are drunk, stuffed and well satisfied.

""Ay, Paddy this is life. I can't remember a day so good in all my 340 years"", said Mick.
""True enough Mick. It's been a fair day, so it has. What'll we do now....hit a club or the West end?""
""Well, Flower, I'm feeling a bit randy so I am, and with all this money we could hire the best lookin' girls in London town for a night of pleasure we'll remember til we die"". 

Within an hour 2 of the most expensive high class and expertly trained hookers in London arrive at the reception desk, and are quickly led up to Paddy and Mick's Suit. The Lad's are stunned as the girls are more beautiful than they could have ever imagined. Taking the Russian blonde Paddy casts a wink to his mate Mick, knocks back the last of his 3rd bottle of Whisky and heads for the bed room. The dark eyed Spanish beauty stands up and leads Mick over to the bed and begins to undress...Mick just can't believe his luck.
Half an hour later, despite the best efforts of Isabella, poor Mick has to throw in the towel. ""Too much drink love"", he says sadly, and rolls over to go to sleep. As he drifts off the last thing he hears is Paddy in the next room shouting: ""One, two, three HUUGGHHH; one, two, three HUUGHHH; one, two, three HUUGGHHHH!!!!"" Blooody hell, thinks Mick....Paddy having a wild time in there!.

The next morning the girls are gone and Paddy and Mick are sitting over a sumptuous breakfast:
""How'd you get on Mick...was that Isabella up to much. Did she earn her money?"", Paddy Laughs. Mick thought about lying, but what'd be the point? After all Paddy was his best mate.
""Bit of a disaster, so it was, Paddy. The drink got to me and the wee man couldn't get up. She did everything but I just couldn't manage to get him working. It's a shame is what it is.""....
At this Paddy bust out laughing: ""Couldn't get it up, you say, hey Mick? I couldn't even get on the fucking bed!!""

""It's just..."", the woman choked between sobs, ""I don't know if you know this, but you are very attractive. It made me realize how unattractive I am. I've never even been kissed.""

The young man took a moment to take in the young woman appearance. She was, in fact, very attractive herself, despite missing all of her appendages. He gently brushed her hair off to one side and they shared a vibrantly passionate kiss.

She blushed heavily, thanked him, and their friendly conversation turned philosophical and deep.
As the sun began to crest over the lake and the atmosphere surrendered to romance, the woman began to cry again.

""What could it be this time?"", asked the young man. ""We have had such a nice evening so far.""

""It's just..."", the woman moaned, ""I've never had this much of a connection with anyone and its bound to end soon now that nightfall is coming. It makes me realize that I've never been fucked. I can't even do it myself.""

His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''

''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.

''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.

''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed.

In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. 

When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. 

So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. 

Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud......

The man was immediately hired, and used the opportunity to ring the bell again. A few paces back, ran head first, and missed the bell completely, fell to the ground, and *splat* died on impact, just like his brother.

The priests worked their way through the gathering crowd, as a man asked, ""Dear Heavens above, does anyone know who *this* man was?""

""Now we're going to try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,"" says the therapist. ""The method essentially focuses on identifying problems and what the patient thinks causes them then rewording their response to remove any instance of self blame and restructing the negative thought with a more constructive approach. I'll work with the first patient as an example, and you'll work with the next one.""

A young college student walks through the door, clearly distressed. ""I did awful on my most recent exam! I am a complete failure!""

The therapist thinks for a moment then says, ""Surely you're not a complete failure. You do well in your other classes, no?"" The student nodded. ""Based on your past experiences, then, it's false to conclude you're a complete failure from one bad grade. Perhaps this was a difficult test for everyone. You did your best, and now you can seek extra help in the class if need be."" The student thanked the therapist and left with a smile.

The next patient walked in. ""Now, it's your turn.""

""Every night I come home my wife immediately starts yelling at me. She must not love me anymore!""

The trainee thought for a minute, then said ""Well, try looking at it this way; you are now free to pursue other women.""","Now, it's your turn.",4

His mom slapped him across the cheek. ""I can't believe you just said that boy, go tell your father what you just said.""

Surprised and a little hurt, he walked over to his Dad in the TV room and said ""Hey look Dad... I'm white!""

When his Dad heard that, he flat out punched the kid. Square in the face. The kid was shocked and confused. The Dad said ""Boy that's the worst shit I've ever heard, go and show your grandma what you did and tell her what you said.

So the kid begrudgingly walked upstairs and walked into his Grandma's bedroom. ""Hey Grandma look, I'm white...""

...and his Grandma just pummeled him. Relentlessly. So hard that both the kids' parents had came upstairs to break up the beating.

They all stood around him and asked him ""Yeah well how do you feel about making that joke now?""

The kid just looked up at them and said ""...Well I've only been white for 10 minutes, and I hate all you niggers already!""

Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God, the rival florist across town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the friars to close. They ignored him. He asked his mother to go and ask the friars to get out of business. They ignored her, too.

So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town, to ""persuade"" them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close shop. Terrified, the friars did so, thereby proving that . . .

I was riding my horse through the desert when I saw him: Pancho Villa. From a mile away I knew him. He wore a pair of leather chaparejos on his legs. On his head he wore a sombrero big enough to stretch from Oaxaca to Aguascalientes and back. But what caught my eye most of all is what he had in his hands: the big guns, both of them pointing right at me.

Pancho Villa called out to me. ""Señor!"" he called out. ""Come down from your horse!""

I looked him in the eye and replied, ""I come down from my horse for no man.""

But what could I do? What could I say? When he had the big guns. So I came down from my horse.

Then Pancho Villa said to me: ""Now, señor, drop the pantalones."" 

I said to him, ""I drop the pantalones for no man.""

But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I dropped the pantalones.

Then Pancho Villa say to me, ""Now, señor, you make a poop.""

I say, ""I make a poop for no man."" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I made a poop like Pancho Villa said.

Then Pancho Villa said to me, ""Now, señor, you will eat your poop."" I answered, ""I eat my poop for no man."" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I began to eat my poop.

Then Pancho Villa let out a very big laugh. He let out a laugh so big and so loud that he frightened his horse. The horse reared up on two legs and Pancho Villa dropped the big guns. I ran to grab them, and suddenly I was the one who had the big guns.

For a long moment, Pancho Villa and I stared at one another, saying not a word.

Then I called out to Pancho Villa. ""Pancho Villa!"" I called out. ""You come down from your horse!""

Pancho Villa gave me a stare that was colder than the snows of Orizaba. In a voice that was slow but determined, he snarled, ""I come down from my horse for no man.""

But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa came down from his horse.

Then I said to him, ""Pancho Villa, drop the pantalones.""

He gave me a menacing look and said, ""I drop the pantalones for no man."" But what could he do? What could he say? when I had the big guns. So he dropped his pantalones.

Then I said to Pancho Villa, ""Pancho Villa, now make a poop."" He said, ""I make a poop for no man."" But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa squatted down to make a poop.

""Now, Pancho Villa,"" I said to him, ""You eat your poop."" He replied, ""I eat my poop for no man."" But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa ate his poop.

So, my friend. You ask me, have I met Pancho Villa? Yes, one time we had lunch together.","So you ask me, my friend, have I met Pancho Villa?",2

SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 10 MILES

He thinks this is a figment of his imagination and drives on without second thought.

Soon he sees another sign which reads:

SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 5 MILES

Suddenly he begins to realize that these signs are for real and drives past a third sign saying:

SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION NEXT RIGHT

His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive. On the far side of the parking lot is a stone building with a small sign next to the door reading:

SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS

He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks,

'What may we do for you! my son?'

He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly doing business....'

'Very well my son. Please follow me.' He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.'

He does so and another nun in a long habit, holding a tin cup answers the door. This nun instructs, 'Please place $100 in the cup then go through the large wooden door at the end of the hallway.'

He puts $100 in the cup, eagerly trots down the hall and slips through the door pulling it shut behind him.

The door locks, and he finds himself back in the parking lot facing another sign:

GO IN PEACE. YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS. SERVES YOU RIGHT, YOU SINNER

He spends a year in hospitals and physical therapy, learning to live with his disability. From the very first day he plans his revenge.

Finally when he's prepared he goes to the mobster's house, waiting in the shadows outside to kill him. But it fails. A bodyguard sees him and stops him, taking his gun and throwing him out of his wheelchair.

 She got in the car and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to ride up her leg exposing a fair amount of skin. 

 The priest nearly had an accident when he saw those shapely legs. 

 After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. Then nun said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” 

The priest quickly removed his hand. But the sight got the better of him. He changed gears and once again let his hand stray to her exposed leg. Once again the nun said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” 

The priest again removed his hand and apologized saying “Sorry Sister, but the flesh is weak.” 

Arriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way. 

 When the priest arrived back at his church, he rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”

Bad traffic, a malfunctioning computer, incompetent coworkers and a sore back all made me a seething cauldron of rage. But more importantly for this story, it had been over forty-eight hours since I'd last taken a dump. I'd tried to jumpstart the process, beginning my day with a bowl of bowel-cleansing fiber cereal, following it with six cups of coffee at work, and adding a bean-laden lunch at Taco Bell. As I was returning home from work, my insides let me know with subtle rumbles and the emission of the occasional tiny fart that Big Things would be happening soon. Alas, I had to stop at the mall to pick up an order. I completed this task, and as I was walking past the stores on my way back to the car, I noticed a large sale sign proclaiming, ""Everything Must Go!"" This was prophetic, for my colon informed me with a sudden violent cramp and a wet, squeaky fart that everything was indeed about to go. I hurried to the mall bathroom. I surveyed the five stalls, which I have numbered 0 through 4 (I write a lot of software) for your convenience: 

0.Occupied 

1.Clean, but Bathroom Protocol forbids its use, as it's next to the occupied one. 

2.Poo on seat. 

3.Poo and toilet paper in bowl, unidentifiable liquid splattered on seat. 

4.No toilet paper, no stall door, unidentifiable sticky object near base of toilet. 

Clearly, it had to be Stall #1. I trudged back, entered, dropped trou and sat down. I'm normally a fairly Shameful Shitter. I wasn't happy about being next to the occupied stall, but Big Things were afoot. 

I was just getting ready to bear down when all of a sudden the sweet sounds of Beethoven came from next door, followed by a fumbling, and then the sound of a voice answering the ringing phone. As usual for a cell phone conversation, the voice was exactly 8 dB louder than it needed to be. Out of Shameful habit, my sphincter slammed shut. The inane conversation went on and on. Mr. Shitter was blathering to Mrs. Shitter about the shitty day he had. I sat there, cramping and miserable, waiting for him to finish. As the loud conversation dragged on, I became angrier and angrier, thinking that I, too, had a crappy day, but I was too polite to yak about in public. My bowels let me know in no uncertain terms that if I didn't get crapping soon, my day would be getting even crappier. 


Finally my anger reached a point that overcame Shamefulness. I no longer cared. I gripped the toilet paper holder in one hand, braced my other hand against the side of the stall, and pushed with all my might. I was rewarded with a fart of colossal magnitude -- a cross between the sound of someone ripping a very wet bed sheet in half and of plywood being torn off a wall. The sound gradually transitioned into a heavily modulated low-RPM tone, not unlike someone firing up a Harley. I managed to hit resonance frequency of the stall, and it shook gently. 

- 

Once my ass cheeks stopped flapping in the breeze, three things became apparent: (1) The next-door conversation had ceased; (2) my colon's continued seizing indicated that there was more to come; and (3) the bathroom was now beset by a horrible, eldritch stench. 

It was as if a gateway to Hell had been opened. The foul miasma quickly made its way under the stall and began choking my poop-mate. This initial ""herald"" fart had ended his conversation in mid-sentence. 

""Oh my God,"" I heard him utter, following it with the suppressed sounds of choking, and then, ""No, baby, that wasn't me (cough, gag), you could hear that (gag)??"" 

Next door I could hear fumbling with the paper dispenser as he desperately tried to finish his task. Little snatches of conversation made themselves heard over my anal symphony: ""Gotta go... horrible... throw up... in my mouth.... not... make it... tell the kids... love them... oh God..."" followed by more sounds of suppressed gagging and retching. 

- 

Alas, it is evidently difficulty to hold one's phone and wipe one's bum at the same time. Just as my high-pressure abuse of the toilet was winding down, I heard a plop and splash from next door, followed by a string of swear words and gags. My poop-mate had dropped his phone into the toilet. 

After a considerable amount of paperwork, I got up and surveyed the damage. I felt bad for the janitor who'd be forced to deal with this, but I knew that flushing was not an option. No toilet in the world could handle that unholy mess. Flushing would only lead to a floor flooded with filth. 

As I left, I glanced to the next-door stall. Nothing remained in the bowl. Had he flushed his phone, or had he plucked it out and left the bathroom with nasty unwashed hands? The world will never know. 

I exited the bathroom, momentarily proud and Shameless, looking around for a face glaring at me. But I saw no one. I suspect that somehow my supernatural elimination has manged to transfer my Shamefulness to my anonymous poop-mate. I think it'll be a long time before he can bring himself to poop in public -- and I doubt he'll ever again answer his cell phone in the loo. And this, my friends, is why you should never talk on your phone in the bathroom.

When he get's to the dealer he immediately spots a beautiful Fat Boy with everything he could ever hoped for, beautiful chrome tailpipes, chrome headlights, leather bags and a phenomenal leather saddle.

The salesman immediately spots Frank as an easy 'sale' and starts talking about the advantages of the motorcycle and paints a wonderful picture for him, 'Imagine yourself driving around the mountains, nobody in sight, feeling free'.

Frank is blown away and buys the bike. The salesman gives him a jar of Vaseline and says, whenever it starts to rain, you should put the Vaseline on the saddle, otherwise the leather will dry out and will start to crackle.

Frank decides he wants to take his new bike for a spin and starts driving into the mountains. After he while he finds out he's out of gas, but nowhere in sight there's a petrol station and to make things even worse, he's hungry as hell.

Fortunately he spots a cute little cabin and decides to push his bike to the cabin and ask for food and gas.

Having arrived at the cabin, Frank finds a friendly family and they invite him for dinner. However the father tells him about two important rules, guests always do the dishes, nobody can talk during dinner, when someone talks they have to do the dishes instead.

The mother of the family presents a wonderful meal, but Frank being worried about doing the dishes takes a quick look into the kitchen and finds dirty dishes up to the ceiling! ""They haven't done dishes in weeks"", he thinks, ""I have to find a way to get them to talks, so I don't have to do it...""

So he decides to drop his glass of water, the family looks, but no one reacts. He decides to take it up a notch and throws his entire plate with food on the ground, again no reaction...

This is bad, Frank thinks, and decides to just throw everything of the table. The family picks up the food and their silverware and continues to eat...

Drastic times call for drastic measures Frank thinks and spots the 18 year old daughter. He takes the daughter and starts fucking her there right on the table... The father looks upset, but doesn't speak a word...
Still sweating from doing the daughter, he decides to fuck the wife as well, he takes her in every possible position known to men, but nobody says a word...

The attorney is astounded by the fact that old man lives such an extravagant lifestyle but has no real steady income. The old man says he affords all his luxuries because he is such a good gambler.


""Sir, I have a hard time believing you are THAT good of a gambler that you can live so well off your winnings,"" says the agent.

""Well, sir, would you like a demonstration?"" says the old man.

The agent agrees to gamble with the old man, so they proceed to start off with a ""small"" wager.

""I bet you a thousand dollars I can bite my own eye,"" says the old man.

The agent is perplexed, but he can't fathom how someone could bite their own eye, so he agrees to the first wager. The old man proceeds to take out his glass eye and bite on it, winning the first bet.  The agent is shocked, and he's upset that he just lost a grand to some crafty old cook.

""Double or nothing I can bite the other eye!"" exclaims the old man.

Seeing as the old man isn't blind, the agent agrees: there's no way he could pull the same trick, and he has to recover his losses somehow.  The old man then proceeds to take out his dentures and bite his eye with them, shocking the tax man.  The agent becomes distraught that he has now lost two thousand dollars right in front of this man's attorney; he starts to panic.

""Tell you what, I'll go double or nothing again,"" says the old man, ""because I bet I can piss in that trash can across the room all the way from your desk and not let a drop hit the floor!""

Now the agent is truly confused.  The old man is in his seventies, and the trash bin is at least twenty feet from his desk. The bet looks like a sure thing, and it's not like the agent has a choice since he needs to get his money back.  For one last time, the agent agrees to take the old man's bet.  

The old man, with great enthusiasm, climbs onto the agent's desk, whips put his dick, and just starts pissing all over the agent's papers, pens, phone, and whatever else was on his desk.

The agent is overjoyed, and he starts cheering and screaming as the old man starts laughing hysterically while zipping up his pants.  However, the agent notices the man's attorney is in shock and starting to cry, so he asks him what's wrong.

""You see, sir, I'm not just this man's lawyer,"" says the attorney, ""I'm also his nephew.  And before we came in here today, this old fucker bet me fifty grand that he could piss on your desk and you'd be happy about it.""",An Old Man is Being Audited by the IRS,9

So, the man opened the first door and saw a room full of people, standing on their heads on a concrete floor. Not very nice, he thought.

Opening the second door, he saw a room full of people standing on their heads on a wooden floor. Better, he thought, but best to check the last door.

Upon opening the last door, he saw a room full of people, standing waist-deep in excrement and sipping coffee.

""Of the three, this one looks best,"" he said and waded in to get something to drink while Satan closed the door.

A few minutes later the door opened, Satan stuck his head in and said, ""Ok, coffee break's over, back on your heads!""

They don't have very much money, but they have a scrawny little dairy cow that gets them through the hard times. 

One day the farmer goes out to milk the cow, but when he gets to the barn, he finds the cow facedown and dead. He knows right then that it's all over, and he grabs the shotgun off the wall and shoots himself in the head. 

His wife hears the gunshot and runs out to see what's happened. She finds the cow and her husband dead and she gives up on life. She grabs the shotgun and shoots herself in the head as well. 

The eldest son comes home from work and finds his parents dead. He goes to use the shotgun, but it's out of ammo. Instead, he runs to the ocean to drown himself. But before he can do that, a mermaid comes out of the water. 

""Wait!"" The mermaid shouts. ""I know what happened to you and your family, and it's terrible! But I can make it all better! I have magic, but it's based on sex! If you can make love to me fifteen times in a row without stopping, I can bring back your mother, your father, and the cow. But if you fail, it will kill you.""

He isn't sure he can do it, but he decides to try. He makes it five times before he gives out and he just can't do it. He can't go on anymore, and he dies. 

The next oldest brother gets home and finds the corpses. He too tries to use the shotgun, finds its out of ammo, and runs to the ocean. The mermaid pops up and makes him the same deal-- but this time, it's 20 times, to save his brother too. He does his best, but he only makes it three times before he can't go on anymore. He, too dies from the magic.

The third brother gets home, and he finds his parents and the cow in the barn and his brothers by the ocean. The mermaid pops up and says, ""wait, wait, wait! I know it's a long shot, but I can grant you your wish if you can just make love to me 25 times in a row without stopping!""

The third brother says, ""I dunno if that's a good idea. I mean, look at what I did to the cow!""",The farm family with the skinny cow,9

The farmer is starting to get pissed off by this stage because the dwarf is quite heavy.

Suddenly the dwarf stops in his tracks and says, “Her twat. her twat, I want to see her twat!”

The farmer, infuriated, pick up the dwarf and drives him head first into the mare’s backside.

He leaves the dwarf’s little legs kicking and wanders off to talk to his mates for a couple of minutes. He then comes back and extracts the dwarf from his predicament, “SCHLOOOOP!”

post,4gd6y6,2qh72,jokes,false,1461589160,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4gd6y6/tax/,self.jokes,,"Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to £100...
If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this...

The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
The fifth would pay £1.
The sixth would pay £3.
The seventh would pay £7.
The eighth would pay £12.
The ninth would pay £18.
The tenth man (the richest) would pay £59.

So, that's what they decided to do.

The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball.

""Since you are all such good customers,"" he said, ""I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by £20"". Drinks for the ten men would now cost just £80.

The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.

So the first four men were unaffected.

They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men?
The paying customers?

How could they divide the £20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?

They realised that £20 divided by six is £3.33. But if they
subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.

So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.

And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).

The sixth now paid £2 instead of £3 (33% saving).

The seventh now paid £5 instead of £7 (28% saving).
The eighth now paid £9 instead of £12 (25% saving).

The ninth now paid £14 instead of £18 (22% saving).

The tenth now paid £49 instead of £59 (16% saving).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.

""I only got a pound out of the £20 saving,"" declared the sixth man.

He pointed to the tenth man,""but he got £10!""

""Yeah, that's right,"" exclaimed the fifth man. ""I only saved a pound too. It's unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!""

""That's true!"" shouted the seventh man. ""Why should he get £10 back, when I got only £2? The wealthy get all the breaks!""

""Wait a minute,"" yelled the first four men in unison, ""we didn't get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!""

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!

And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works.

The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction.

Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.

In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.

The very next day, a skinny Irishman showed up at the camp with his axe, and knocked on the Foreman's door. 
       
The Foreman took one look at the small Irishman and told him to leave. ""Just give me a chance to show you what I can do,"" said the Irishman. 
       
""Okay, see that giant redwood over there?"" said the Foreman. ""Take your axe and go cut it down.""

""I cut the tree down,"" said the Irishman. 

""*Holy smokes!*"" Said the Formean. ""Where did you get the skill to chop down trees like that?"" 
       
""In the Sahara Forest,"" replied the Irishman.
