One day, a managerial demon found three stories that required confirmation.

Story 1: I suspected that my wife was cheating on me, so when I told her I left for work, I hid in our bedroom closet with the heftiest hammer I could find. A few hours later, I heard a man enter my bedroom, so I jumped out of the closet, hammer poised to strike. When I was out, the man was gone. I looked all over the apartment for him, and eventually I found him on the balcony, hanging by his fingertips. I smash his fingertips with my hammer, but the bastard won't fall, so in a rush of adrenaline, I grab the refrigerator and toss it on top of him, dying shortly thereafter due to the strain.

The demon checks and confirms the death, and moves on to the next.

Story 2: So I'm running a con on this chick, acting like I'm her ""cable guy,"" getting ready to steal her identity. I walk in her bedroom to check for documents, when this maniac jumps out of the closet with a hammer! So I run out and hide on his balcony, hanging by my fingers. I think I'm in the clear, when suddenly my fingers are being smashed. I manage to hold on, but only barely, until I feel a refrigerator crush me.

And so the story was processed and confirmed, and he moved on to the third.

""May I ask a favor?"" she said. I shrugged. Might as well help this poor grieving woman. ""As I leave the line, will you please tell me 'Bye mom, see you at the car'? It will help me feel like I'm going to see my son again soon."". I agreed. It was a little gesture that would hopefully go a long way.

""I'll be waiting for you,"" she replied back happily, and hurried out of the store.

I smiled at the good deed I had done, when the cashier rang up my small basket of items. ""Your total today will be $316.47 sir,"" he stated.

Confused at the price, I asked ""Why so expensive? I only bought a couple things?""

""Oh, your mother told me you would be paying for both carts and that you would meet her outside.""

Oh no she didn't!

I dropped the rest of my items on the belt and bolted for the outside to find my 'mother'.

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says.

A hunter is nearby, and thinks if the fly drops 4 feet, the fish eats him, and the bear catches the fish, he can hunt the bear down. A mouse is nearby and notices the hunter has a cheese sandwich in his pocket, and thinks if the fly goes down 4 feet, gets caught by the fish, gets caught by the bear, and killed by the hunter, the cheese sandwich will fall down, and he will be able to eat it. A cat is perched on a tree nearby, and thinks that if the fly goes down 4 feet, gets caught by the fish, eaten by the bear, killed by the hunter, and the mouse eats the sandwich, he can pounce on the mouse.

Naturally, she was very upset. “You are a disrespectful pig!” she cried. “How dare you do this to me! I’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I’m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!”
The husband replied, “Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.”
“Go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”
So the husband began, “Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.
I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!
Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.
I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”
The husband took a quick breath and continued, “She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…”

I have the money and I’m not leaving until I do.’

The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He asked, ‘Do any of the girls have any diseases?’ Of course, the Madam said no, but the boy replied, ‘I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making it with Amber. So THAT’S the girl I want!’

Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door.

The Madam stopped him and asked, ‘Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?’

He said, ‘Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with my babysitter. After they leave, my babysitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of little boys. She will get the disease that I just caught.

post,54v2o6,2qh72,jokes,false,1475044188,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/54v2o6/a_deal_with_the_devil/,self.jokes,,"Five months ago, I made a deal with the devil.

It sounds so dramatic, but it is so, so simple; and once you know how, it is hard not to.

But you must resist, for if you don’t, you will regret it later. Trust me on that.

First, a little something about me. I’m what you’d call a slacker, a slothful waster, or even a ‘bundle of disappointment’. That’s all anyone’s ever called me. I’ve made peace with that. Truth be told, these epithets have become more truly my friends than any other I’ve ever known, following me everywhere I go and in all things I do. But it does hurt sometimes, for I’m not without feelings of my own, and I have periodically been beset by resentment for these companions of mine.
It was in one of these periods of discontent that the devil approached me with his deal.

That’s what he always does, to all of his victims.

It’s been said before, more often than not, that when the devil approaches you, he’d affect a character that you’d immediately like and be impressed by. It’s absolutely true. When he first came to me, he seemed more than anything a dazzling showman brimming with charisma and a touch of ridiculousness, not unlike a circus clown.

I’m sorry I can’t be more dramatic, but the truth of the matter is, it happened when I was just sitting at home eating popcorn, and the details of the encounter are too hazy. (for reasons I’d rather not divulge: suffice it to say, I’ve found less than healthy ways to deal with my problems) I remember only two things: the first, an unearthly, unforgettable orange-golden glow emanating from his person, and the second, the indescribable hatred in his words, which seemed to dragged from a deep well of loathing and blinding rage hidden within him.

His offer was simple: he asked of me only that I be a tether for him to this world, and to support him, however I felt, in all his endeavors. In return, he promised me (hindsight is always 20/20, isn’t it?) what I had always desired most from this world: to be known, talked about, and a subject of strong feeling among my peers. He was very outspoken about his plans, schemes of evil rarely witnessed before in the world, but I thought then that he was only posturing: surely he would never divulge his plans to a mere mortal. How foolish of me.

Each day, the burden in my heart grew heavier and heavier still, and beset by guilt, I began seeing him everywhere: when I watched TV, he would become one of the characters and spew his hatred and rage on all others; when I walked the streets, I would so often by ambushed by the bright orange glow that I had begun to dread as the very symbol of evil; I have spent the last five months evading him.

And worse still, strangely, it is as if his aura clings to me; everywhere I go, I can feel eyes digging into my very self – disbelieving, disapproving eyes, more full of contempt and dislike than ever before: he offered me a chance to be noticed and felt strongly about – and he has given me that. But the deal is done: it can no longer be called off. I have but myself to blame for that.

But however bad any of these things are, none of them come quite close to the occasions I dread most – his meetings with me. He summons me at times when I least expect; he ambushes me with the sharpest weapons he possesses: his words. For hours on end, he would speak on about the most abhorrent matters imaginable – as I stood motionless and wide-eyed behind him, my lips parted in disbelief and disorientation, the orange-golden glow exuded by him piercing my eyes, he would unravel his dark plans for us, plans I don’t care to elaborate here.

Two weeks ago yesterday, all this came to a head. I have said before that he enjoys ambushing me at times when I had my guard down, and that day he unraveled the worst surprise he had for me: staring at me in five bold, short words from a piece of paper as white as chalk, was the ultimate denunciation and condemnation of all I had endured; the greatest and most heartbreaking disavowal I have ever encountered. Written in a nondescript, matter-of-fact way were the words:

Now I couldn't hold any more so I called the waiter and asked him to bring a freezy lemonade drink. I requested him to make sure he opens the bottle near us so that a bomb-like sound could be heard.

When I went to city hall to renew his dog license, I told the clerk I would like a license for Sex. He said, ""I'd like one too!""

Then, I said, ""But this is a dog."" He said he didn't care what she looked like. Then, I said, ""You don't understand, I've had Sex since I was 9 years old."" He winked and said, ""You must have been quite a kid.""

When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I told the motel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me and a special room for Sex.

He said, ""You don't need a special room. As long as you pay your bill, we don't care what you do."" I said, ""Look, you don't seem to understand. Sex keeps me awake at night."" The clerk said, ""Funny -- I have the same problem.""

One day, I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just standing there, looking disappointed. I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me I should have sold my own tickets. ""But you don't understand,"" I said, ""I had hoped to have Sex on TV."" He said, ""Now that cable is all over the place, it's no big deal anymore.""

When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your honor, I had Sex before I was married."" The judge said, ""The courtroom isn't a confessional. Stick to the case, please.""

Then, I told him that after I was married, Sex left me. He said, ""Me too.""

Last night, Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over town for him. A cop came over to me and asked, ""What are you doing in this alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?"" I told him that I was looking for Sex. My case comes up Friday.",My Dog Named Sex,20

A helicopter with a pilot and a single passenger was flying
around above Seattle when a malfunction disabled all of the
aircraft's navigation and communications equipment.

Due to the darkness and haze, the pilot could not determine the
helicopter's position and course to get back to the airport.

The pilot saw a tall building with lights on and flew toward it,
the pilot had the passenger draw a handwritten sign reading,
""WHERE AM I?"", and hold it up for the building's occupants to
see.

People in the building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a
large sign, and held it in a building window.

Their sign said, ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the
course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.

After they were on the ground, the passenger asked the pilot how
the ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their
position.

The pilot responded, ""I knew that had to be the Microsoft
support building, they gave me a technically correct but
entirely useless answer.""

""Oh don't worry,"" the little boy says. ""It's a little leprechaun.""

""Now don't lie to me, show me what you have in your hand."" replied the teacher. 

""I told you, it's a little leprechaun. If I show him to you, he'll get scared and run away."" said the student. 

At this point the teacher started to get frustrated. 

""If you don't show me what's in your hand, I'm sending you to the principals office and calling your parents."" the teacher threatened angrily.

The little boy refuses, so he gets sent to the principals office.

Once there, the conversation happens again.

""Fine. If you don't want to show me what's in your hand, you can explain it to your parents. They're on their way now."" said the principal.

His mother tried unsuccessfully for several minutes to get the boy to show her what was in his hands, but the boy refused with the same excuse. 

""If I show him to you, he's going to get scared and run away.""

post,54qf6j,2qh72,jokes,false,1474980899,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/54qf6j/tale_of_the_banana/,self.jokes,,"There once was a young man who was so enthralled with bananas that he decided to go down to the tropics and start up a plantation of his own. He saved up his money and within a few years, found himself in a jungle city making deals to purchase the land required to start a plantation. This however, was very easy, and once he found the appropriate plot of land, he set out to find banana seeds.
This was where he ran into trouble. Everyone had bananas, but no one had banana seeds. In fact no one knew from where to get banana seeds, and this frustrated him greatly. Finally one old man took pity on his plight and suggested that he would tell him how to get banana seeds.
“To grow bananas from seed, you must first have the right banana. Fortunately I have such bananas for sale, and I will sell you some. But getting the seeds out is hard work. You see, you have to cut off the end of the seed banana, like this, and then you have to suck on the open end. You have to suck and suck, and not give up until you get a seed. After the first seed, the rest of the seeds come out easier,” explained the old man.
The young man thought this very peculiar, but he bought the bananas and took them home. He cut off the end of one banana, and started to suck. He sucked all the banana insides out, but no banana seed came out. Thinking perhaps he had a dud banana, he picked out another and repeated the procedure. Finally, he gave up and decided to come back to the guy who sold him the “special” bananas and complain.
“So you sucked until there was no more banana left in the skin, you say? But did you keep on sucking on the banana after that? You have to continue to suck the banana until it is well past empty. Then the seeds will come out. Go home and try it again,” said the old man.
He returned home and cut open yet another banana again, and began to suck on the banana again. He sucked until the banana was completely sucked empty, and his lips turned blue. He was sure he was being ripped off by the old man, and he went back to him the next day.
“Those bananas were good seed bananas, but if you don’t believe me, I will give you this bunch of seed bananas for free. But I tell you there is no other way to get banana seeds than to suck on an empty banana. If you do not get any seeds from this bunch or the last bunch, you may come back here, and I will give you all your money back. But I am sure you will have all the seeds you want if you really put yourself into extracting the seeds,” the old man recommended.
Well, the young man decided he would put his best effort into these new bananas, that one way or another, he would suck the seeds out of them. He concentrated his efforts on one of the new bananas, emptying it of the fruit. When he was sucking on just the skin, he kept at it, and finally after a couple hours, he felt something in his mouth. It has small, hard; it was a seed ! He sucked some more and soon he had a handful of seeds from just one banana. He then followed up on all the other bananas of both bunches, and by the next day, he was ready to plant.

The moral of this story is: If at first you don’t suck seeds, try and try again.",Tale of the banana.,32

""But of course you understand: that means I've got to charge by the inch!""

Now, one family he makes this pitch to are a peasant couple with no children. ""We've tried and tried, but we just can't conceive a child,"" says the husband. ""So we're willing to pay for your services, even though it makes me ashamed. We need someone to carry on the family and take care of us in old age.""

""But we're only poor peasants, so all we can afford is a few pennies.""

""Very well,"" says the con man, ""that means I'll only be able to use the tip. The child will grow up to be a peasant, like yourselves.""

""So be it,"" says the husband, ""we've never been ambitious.""

So the con man is working away with the wife, although since he's using just the tip it's taking a while.

As things are coming to a climax, he doesn't notice, but the husband is sneaking up behind him. He winds his foot back and gives the man a big *kick*, right on the ass! The con man loses his balance and goes *all the way* in.

Jimmy goes to see a beautiful dominatrix that all his buddies recommended. 

He nervously tells her, ""My friends said I should ask you for a 'Classic-Vlasic-Ass-Lick'. But they wouldn't tell me anything about it. What is it exactly?"" 

She explains, ""Well, first I'm going to strip you naked, tie you up, bend you over my knees and spank you like a naughty child.  That's the Classic part."" 

""Then I'm going to stick one of these Vlasic brand pickles in your cute little pickle hole."" 

""And finally, I'm going to give you the most amazing, toe cracking, rim job of you life. The Ass-Lick.""

Well, Jimmy isn't thrilled with the idea of getting tied up, spanked and sticking a pickle up his posterior. Or even sure he'd enjoy analingus. Plus, it was a little expensive.  But he agrees to pay for a Classic-Vlasic-Ass-Lick, since all his buddies said it was incredible. 

So she strips him down, ties him up, bends him over and starts spanking him with various toys.  

Jimmy is surprised how much he is enjoying it, but still pretty nervous about the pickle insertion, so he asks her to please be gentle when she sticks the pickle in his behind.

She tells him not to worry, grabs a large pickle and a paddle, and gently pounds it deep inside Jimmy's rear end, until that pickled cucumber disapears with a ""pop!"" 

Then she proceeds to give him the most amazing, toe cracking, multiple orgasm inducing, rim job of his life.

When finished, Jimmy exclaims, ""That was incredible!  But how exactly do I get the pickle out now?""

""No idea."" She says. ""All my other clients prefer to just eat the pickle.""

""What!?"" Jimmy sputters. ""My mouth was the pickle hole!? Why did you stick it up my ass?!""

""You asked me to put in your behind.""  

Thinking back, Jimmy realizes she is technically correct.  Now he is in a real pickle, because a pickle is in him. 

""Well that was a bad deal.""  Jimmy mumbles. ""I have no idea how to get this crappy pickle out.""

""Sorry, no refunds. But you know you loved it."" she replies, ""You got a good dill, just relish it.""

One day, two boys filled up a bucket full of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.


Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....""


He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.


""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""


The man said, ""Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.


Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""


The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.


At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""

Unfortunately for the priest, teaching chickens to talk proved to be a considerably more difficult task. 

He started, logically enough, by trying to coax two old hens into a conversation. He bought the birds from a local farmer who promised that they were the most talkative hens he'd ever owned. But no matter what the priest tried, he could not get them to talk. 

Well, the chickens weren't talking but the farmer was. Soon the whole village knew about the mad old priest who had finally snapped, who had stopped going to Sunday services, stopped taking weddings and funerals, and who had been down to the farm looking for 'talkative chickens'. 

That, as I'm sure you can appreciate, is the kind of rumour that has no trouble in spreading itself. It wasn't long before the church caught wind, and the church was not happy. 

Weeks passed by. The chickens were neither chitting, nor chatting. 

Then, one morning the priest had a clever thought - if old dogs were so against learning new tricks, why would two old hens be any different! He went back to the farmer, but this time he asked to buy two chicks. He carried the little birds back from the farm in a shoe box, right through the village, all the way to his garden shed. Then, he shut the door, and tried to start up a conversation. 

That was a few weeks ago now. I haven't seem him in that time, but a few days ago some of the local kids heard him shouting to himself in his shed, ""These bloody chicks are too old! I need to start younger still!""

The church definitely aren't happy, either.

Bored of the one-sided conversation, the monk soon proposed a challenge of wits.


The farmhand was uninterested in testing his wits against the monk, no matter how much his roommate raised the stakes. Finally the monk offered the farmhand substantial odds: ""I will give you 50 gold coins for every question of yours I cannot answer, if you will give me 5 gold coins for every question YOU cannot answer.""


At this, the farmhand agreed.


""Very well!"" exclaimed the monk. he eagerly tried to think of a question sufficient to challenge the farmhand, but simple enough to keep the game interesting. ""How would one measure the volume of an irregularly shaped object?"" he asked, his eyes gleaming.


Without even bothering to think about it, the farmhand handed the monk 5 gold coins.


The monk was disappointed, but prepared himself for the farmhand's challenge.


For his turn, the farmhand pinched his face deep in thought. Finally, he asked: ""What has the heart of a tiger, the wisdom of an eagle, and the strength of an ox?""


Delighted by the riddle, the monk leapt to his feet and began pacing around the room. For six hours he was mercifully silent as he pondered the farmhand's conundrum. Soon, he grew irritable. Eventually his face sunk with fury and disdain. ""Alas, alas! I give up!"" he cried, waving his arms. Reluctantly he withdrew a sack of coins and counted out fifty precious gold pieces for the farmhand. The Tiller happily accepted his winnings.
The monk stared at his roommate. ""Well!"" he said at last. ""What is the answer to your riddle?""

The statue is to be revealed at the 100th anniversary of the battle, accompanied by much revelry.  The Chief asks the sculptor to visualise his interpretation of the last thing to ever go through Colonel Custer's mind.  The sculptor agrees and goes away to think and sculpt.

The day of the anniversary arrives.  The hitherto unseen statue remains cloaked in tarpaulin.  The party is in full flow.  The chief calls the revellers to attention, and they wait in eager anticipation of finally seeing the memorial.  After a few words, the Chief lifts off the tarpaulin.

Stunned silence reigns as the crowd behold a fish nailed to a crucifix, the crucifix decorated with pages from the Karma Sutra.  The Chief gives the sculptor a quizzical look and asks what he thought could possibly be going through Custer's mind as he was slain.  The sculptor replies ""Holy mackerel!

The Doctor says: ""I have a cure for that. When it seems that your husband is getting angry, just take a glass of water and start swishing it in your mouth. Just swish and swish but don't swallow it until he either leaves the room or calms down.""

Two weeks later the woman comes back to the Doctor looking refreshed and reborn.

Umbatu was an island, which was split almost directly down the middle by a tall mountain, Mount Okanaway. On either side of the mountain, there were small settlements. To the east resided Tridia. There were many beautiful trees bearing many tasty fruits and nuts, but clean drinking water was scarce. To the West was Relice. Relice was a very self reliant nation that kept to itself.

Legend told that atop Mount Okanaway stood a great giant that had not let any Trid past to ask aid of the Relicians in many centuries. The Trids grew desperate, and the elder counsel gathered on this day to come up with a plan to cross the mountain and ask for clean drinking water.

""We should send our strongest man! That way he can defeat the giant and carry back as much water as he can carry!"" said one of the elders. Many more were in agreement, so they held a tournament to find the strongest man in the village.

After the the tournament had ended and a man was found, they sent him on his way up the mountain pass to begin his journey. A day or two later this man reach the peak of the mountain and was in awe when he found the legend was true! ""Who are you!"" the giant boasted. ""Why, I am the strongest man in all of Tridia! I have come to ask aid of Relice!"" the man replied. ""Then you shall not pass!"" the giant swung his mighty leg and kicked the man all the way back to Tridia.

The elder counsel was not pleased that their plan had not worked, and had come up with another plan to hopefully get aid from Relice. ""Let us send our most beautiful woman to Mount Okanaway, that way she may woo the giant, and gain passage to Relice!"" an elder commented, and many more agreed.

After spending a few hours scouring the village, they found the most beautiful woman in the village. There was no doubt in the elder counsel that this woman could bend the will of the giant, so they sent her on her way.

After a long trek through the mountain pass, the woman had made it to the sote of the giant. ""Who are you!"" the giant boasted yet again. ""Why I am the most beautiful woman in Tridia! All of the Trids adore me and I could be yours if you would let me through to ask aid of the Relicians!"" the woman replied. ""You cannot bribe me with beauty!"" the giant shouted, and kicked the woman with mighty force, all the way back to Tridia.

The elders had run out of ideas. They were becoming desperate and their people needed water. ""May i be of assistance?"" an old, foreign Jewish Rabbi from far off lands approached the elder counsel. ""I do not think you could help old Rabbi. We sent our strongest man and our most beautiful woman to face the giant, and both were kicked all the back to Tridia! But if you must, you may try yourself and see the bottom of the giants foot for yourself!""

The Rabbi, not easily dissuaded, left for the mountain pass shortly thereafter. After a much longer hike than those before him, he finally reached the giant. ""Excuse me giant, I am not the Strongest man, nor the most beautiful, but I am a Rabbi from distant lands. I have come to ask if i may pass and ask aid of Relice."" the Rabbi spoke softly. ""Why certainly"" replied the giant and moved aside to allow the Rabbi to pass. As the Rabbi passed the giant, he asked ""why did you allow me to pass, but not the man or woman before me?""

The giant replied, ""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""",There once was a beautiful land...,7

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

So, he finally came to the decision to stop buying tea, and use all the money he saved from not buying tea to fund his new dream.

After a couple years, he had accumulated plenty and took 2 weeks off work to take his trip over the Summer. As his plane was flying over the Australian outback, about 2 hours out from Sydney, the plane ran into a flock of birds, and crashed in the middle of the outback, leaving him unconscious and the only survivor.

Several weeks later, he awoke in what he soon learned was a Catholic convent. A nun quickly came to him as he awoke.

""Oh goodness, it seems our prayers have been answered! We've all been so worried after sister Katherine found you out in that plane wreck!""

He thanked her profusely, and looked around him. ""If I may ask, where exactly am I?""

""Why, your in Our Lady of Mercy convent! You've been out cold for several weeks now. Is there anything you need?""

""Well... I'm an Englishman who wanted to go on vacation here in Australia, and I stopped drinking tea for several years, and used the money I saved to get my plane ticket, which as you can tell worked out awfully. Would you please get me some tea, I'm dieing to have some after so long.""

The nun seemed a bit worried. ""I'm sorry sir, but... We have no English tea. We do however have a tea of water boiled for several hours in Koala hides.""

Well to the man, that sounded absolutely revolting, but he was quite parched and accepted. She quickly left and came back with a cup. He took a sip and immediately spat it out.

""There's hair in here! Don't you at least drain it?""

post,54judq,2qh72,jokes,false,1474883268,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/54judq/the_legend_of_the_three_kingdoms/,self.jokes,,"There were three kingdoms, each bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The legend of the three kingdoms,10841

Next up was the Army general. He wanted to be measured from the tip of his finger to the tip of his other finger. It was 80 inches. He received $800,000.
The two generals were very happy with their earnings.
Finally the Marine general came up. He said he wanted to be measured from the tip of his dick to the tip of his balls. The man said, ''Sir, do you know how much the other generals received?''
The general said no. ''Sir, they received $690,000 and $800,000 respectively, are you sure that is what you want measured?''
The general said, ''Just do it!''
The man dropped the general's pants and measured his d**k. When he went for the general's balls, they weren't there. The man said, ''Sir, where are your balls.''

Nonetheless, he now is without testicles and impotent. He begins to get depressed, so he goes out and buys a sports car. He feels a little better, so decided to splurge on a fancy new suit from a local tailor.

The tailor measured him for a beautiful Italian suit and he looks fantastic while wearing it. As he's leaving, the tailor offers to give him some free underwear to go with his new wardrobe.

The man says, ""Sure. I'll take a pair of small, please.""

The tailor said, ""Oh no. You are not a small, you need large... I know, I measured you.""

The man says, ""No, you are wrong; I've worn small all my life.""

post,54im6w,2qh72,jokes,false,1474858238,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/54im6w/changing_his_name/,self.jokes,,"Earlier this year, a chinese family moved into my small town. The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said
""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in, ""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. 

He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.
""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.
""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.
Hold on the that fee, Ling""
