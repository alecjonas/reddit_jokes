""I'm sorry, sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I'll smell it and order from there."" 

A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. 

He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. 

The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. 

""Ah, yes, that's what I'll have -- meatloaf and mashed potatoes."" 

Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. 

The cook happens to be the owner's wife.

He tells her what had just happened. 

The blind man eats his meal and leaves. 

Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again. 

""Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man."" 

""I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork."" 

The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. 

After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great. I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli."" 

Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him. 

The blind man eats and leaves. 

He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. 

He tells his wife, ""Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man."" 

Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. 

As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. 

""Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you."" 

The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, ""Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here...""",A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down...,632

Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.
When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring.
She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. 
Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn’t keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Chuck stands up. ""I'm sorry, doc, but I just can't believe that's the only solution. I'm getting a second opinion.""

So Chuck decides to fly back to Vietnam, in hopes that the local doctors will know more about the rare disease. He finds a doctor, and makes an appointment.

""Oh yes,"" the Vietnamese doctor says. ""We see all the time, very common here. You no worry.""

""Thank goodness! The American doctor wanted to amputate my dick!""

He was abusive to all of his subordinates and would even bully members of the board to get his way. He once chewed out a Senior Vice President because he didn't like the color of the VP's tie. He once fired a division director for using the wrong cover for his quarterly TPS report.  And he liked to assert his superiority in calling last minute, mandatory, all-hands-required meetings.

When the staff heard that there was one of these meetings coming up, he knew that there would be trouble. And sure enough, when the CEO arrived (five minutes late), he went straight into a tirade about… flying alligators.

After he finished the room went silent. The CEO turned red.

&gt; I don't believe that you have all understood the gravity of this situation.

Facing the COO he shouted, 

&gt; Dave, why aren't you concerned about this‽ You mean to tell me that you don't believe in flying alligators‽

Dave replied,

&gt; I do sir, it's just, they fly really, really low.",The tyrannical CEO,0

The plumber fixes the sink quickly, but discovers a few other problems which also need to be fixed. The plumber is done after about 2 hours, and gives the professor the bill. The professor realizes that the plumber gets paid much more than he does. Having watched the plumber fixing the pipes, he thought it didn't look to difficult and that becoming a plumber might earn more money than being a professor.

""I'm sorry to bother you, but is your employer hiring?"" Asked the professor.

""Yes, they are,"" replied the plumber, ""but there is one thing you must know before you apply.""

""And what might that be?""

""They don't like educated people very much, so if you want to get the job you will need to lie and say you only have a 6th grade education.""

The professor followed his advice, and got a job as a plumber. He quit his job at the University. Everything went well for him, and he had worked as a plumber for 6 months when the company decided that all their plumbers should have at least a 7th grade education. They were enrolled in night classes.

On the first day, everything went well. Being an educated person, the professor already knew all the curriculum, but he made sure to put in a wrong answer here and there so nobody would find out.

On the second day, everything went smoothly as well, until the instructor asked the professor for the formula for the area of a circle. As he walked to the front of the room, his mind went totally blank. He could not remember the formula, no matter how hard he tried. 

He frantically wrote equations and formulas on the blackboard, trying to find the formula he needed. He found something after several minutes of frantic scribbling, but alas, it was incorrect. He felt defeated, knowing his secret would be revealed and he hadn't even gotten the question right.

The plumbers quietly talked among themselves. The professor thought about what insults they might be coming up with, and what would happen to him now that they knew he was educated. They talked for a minute, before, apparently at a conclusion, one plumber stood up. The professor steeled himself for an insult, as the plumber began to speak:

I just can't comprehend how this guy is so successful. How did he win? And to be on the biggest stage in the world now. It doesn't make sense. No one ever thought he was a real contender, but here he is.

With all the scandal, how people think his wins are illegitimate because of tampering, how he'll need an asterisk next to his name in the history books, etc. what are we supposed to think?

It is surreal: his goofy haircuts, his weird sense of style, his cockiness, his supermodel trophy wife, his ridiculous popularity with some people (yet I don't know anyone around me who likes him). 

The media gives him so much attention, in a weird love/hate relationship. Some already say he's the greatest ever. How do you ignore it?

I don't care what anyone says, I'm rooting for him to fail.

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

The old man was visibly upset.  He spoke to the salesman sharply.

“Young man, I thought you said you would hold that car till we raised the $55,000 asking price,” said the older man. “Yet I just heard you closed the deal for $45,000 to the lovely young lady there.  And if I remember right, you had insisted there was no way you could discount this model.” 

The salesman took a deep breath, cleared his throat and reached for a large glass of water. “Well, what can I tell
you? She had the cash ready, didn’t need any financing help, and, Sir, just look at her, how could I resist?”, replied the grinning salesman sheepishly.

He opens then door and sees his wife run naked across the living room into the bathroom where she locks the door. 


The guy says ""Damn it! I knew you were having an affair, where is he!?""


She says to just calm down. But then he hears a noise outside their apartment. He looks down and sees a naked man holding onto the balcony ledge below. 


""Ah! There you are, you asshole! I'll get you"" says the man. He throws random items at the guy trying to get him to lose his grip and fall. Nothing is working. Then the guy hanging for his life hears a loud rumble and sees a fridge being pushed over the railing above him. The fridge hits him, he falls to the ground and is crushed by the fridge, and then dies. 


The guy right away feels sick for what he did. He decides to call the cops and explain the everything. But as he turns around he slips on liquid left by the fridge, tumbles over the railing, falls onto the fridge, and dies from the impact. 


Up in heaven St Peter sees a naked man walking up to the gates. St Peter explains that the naked man has died and in order to enter heaven he must have died on a bad day. 


The naked man says: well, I was working out on my treadmill at home and since my AC wasn't working I opened by balcony window and took my clothes off. However I was sweating too much and I slipped and was launched at my balcony railing and just couldn't hold on. Then some guy in the apartment above me starts yelling at me and throwing stuff St me. He threw a fridge at me and when I hit the ground I woke up here. 


St Peter says that sounds just horrible. All the guy was doing was trying to stay healthy. Even though he should have been smarter about equipment placement, it equals to dying on bad day. The gates open and the naked man walks in. 


St Peter sees another man walk up. Dressed nice with a big coffee stain on the shirt. St Peter tells the guy about the dying on a bad day rule and hopes spilling coffee isn't all that happened. 


The guy goes on to tell St Peter about his day at work, his wife cheating, and what happened to the guy he threw a fridge on. He explains about how upset he was and how sorry he was after what had taken place. 


St Peter waves his hand and tells the guy that all is understood. His day sounded terrible and he can see that the man is truly sorry for what he did. St Peter opens the gates and wishes the man to have the happiest time in heaven. 


St Peter then sees a third guy walking up. Tells him about the dying on a bad day rule. 


This guy says to St Peter: man, let tell you about my day Pete. I'm having sex with this amazing woman, she hides me in the fridge when her husband gets home for whatever reason. The things starts moving. Next thing I know I'm walking about this place. ",New rule to get into Heaven,2

The guy walks up to the Indian and raises his hand and says, “How”.

The Indian replies, “Scrambled.”",Amazing Red Cloud,56

Trump hollers “Well dammit, don’t just sit there! Get out and find out who did it! I want an answer, and I want it tonight!”

The entire staff immediately jump up and race for the exits.

Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says: “Well Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some really bad news. Which do you want first?”

Trump says “Give me the bad news first.”

The officer says “Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it. The results just came back, and it was Mike Pence’s urine.”

post,5q37t1,2qh72,jokes,false,1485351699,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5q37t1/to_the_citizens_of_the_usa_from_her_sovereign/,self.jokes,,"To the citizens of the United States of America from Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

In the light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for President of the USA, and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately. 

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except North Dakota, which she does not fancy). 

Our new Prime Minister, Theresa May, will appoint a Governor for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded -- a questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.


To aid in the transition to a British Crown dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: 

1. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'colour,' 'favour,' 'labour' and 'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix '-ize' will be replaced by the suffix '-ise.' Generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary'). 

2. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as 'like' and 'you know' is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. There is no such thing as U.S. English. We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take into account the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of '-ize.' 

3. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday. 

4. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not quite ready to be independent. Guns should only be used for shooting grouse. If you can't sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not ready to shoot grouse. 

5. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. Although a permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public. 

6. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left side with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Both roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour. 

7. The former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline) of roughly $10/US gallon. Get used to it. 

8. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar. 

9. The cold, tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer, and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as Lager. South African beer is also acceptable, as they are pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. They are also part of the British Commonwealth - see what it did for them. American brands will be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine so that all can be sold without risk of further confusion. 

10. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play English characters. Watching Andie Macdowell attempt English dialect in Four Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater. 

11. You will cease playing American football. There is only one kind of proper football; you call it soccer. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies). 


12. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.1% of you are aware of a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. You will learn cricket, and we will let you face the South Africans first to take the sting out of their deliveries. 

13. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad. 

14. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776). 

15. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 p.m. with proper cups and saucers, and never mugs, with high-quality biscuits (not cookies) and cakes; plus strawberries (with cream) when in season.


*God Save the Queen!*

""Well"" says his agent ""it's a one-liner""

""That's okay"" replies the actor, ""I've been out of work for so long I'll take anything; What's the line?""

""'Hark I hear the cannons roar'"" says the agent.

""I love it"" says the actor ""When's the audition?""

""Wednesday"" says the agent.

Wednesday comes and the actor arrives at the audition. He marches on stage and shouts: ""Hark I hear the cannons roar"".

""Brilliant"" says the director, ""you've got the job, be here 9 o'clock Saturday evening"".

The actor is so chuffed he got the job that he goes on a major bender. He wakes up 8:30 Saturday evening and runs to the theatre continually repeating his line; ""Hark I hear the cannons roar, hark I hear the cannons roar, hark I hear the cannons roar"".

He arrives at the stage entrance, out of breath and is stopped by the bouncer. ""Who the hell are you?"" asks the bouncer.

""I'm 'hark I hear the cannons roar'""

""You're 'hark I hear the cannons roar', you're late, get up to makeup straight away.

So he runs up to make up. ""Who the hell are you"" asks the makeup girl. ""I'm 'hark I hear the cannons roar'""

""You're ""hark I hear the cannons roar"", you're late, sit down here"" and she applies the makeup. ""Now quick, get down to the stage, you're about to go on""

So he dashes down to the stage. ""Who the hell are you"" asks the stage manager.

""I'm 'hark I hear the cannons roar'""

""You're 'hark I hear the cannons roar', get on there, the curtains about to go up""

So he tears onto the stage. The curtains rise, the house is full.

Suddenly there is an almighty bang behind him, and the actor shouts ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!""","An out of work actor gets a call from his agent one day. ""I've got you a job"" says his agent.",3784

Down the corridor from Slartibartfarst and his fjord design office, in the planet construction halls, another magrethean is called in to see his supervisor.

“You wanted to see me sir”

“Ah, Zebon sit down,” The supervisor said pointing to chair, “I’m loving your work on the reptiles for Earth 2.0 the gecko is top notch, walks up walls!, and the chameleon is master stroke.”

“I can sense a ‘but’ sir”

“Well see it’s the snake”

“what about it?”

“Are we putting you under too much pressure?”

“no sir”

“Then this design, it lacks the effort of your normal work”

“I’m quite proud of it sir”

“well it’s just…just a tube really Zebon”

“I would call it sleek”

“and your happy with that? how will it move?”

“Slither sir”

“Couldn’t you give it legs”

“It doesn’t need legs; it is perfect design sir”

“Well Zebon that is bothersome, you see back in my day in the office I invented legs and think they are perfect for the job of locomotion”

“true sir, they are but we have kind of been using them a lot recently”

“Still I think the snake would be better with at least one or two legs”

“Why sir”

“It’s just well CREEPY!”

“The snake is not creepy sir”

“yes it is creepy Zebon, I’m sure legs would make it less creepy…Yes legs make it a lot less creepy”

“What sir, like the spiders?”

“Ok I admit I made a mistake with the spiders… too many legs, but it was an experiment”

“and the centipede”

“You know well Zebon I was drunk that day. I still think the snake would be less creepy with a couple of legs”

“Please sir just try it”

“Zebon you’re a good designer and the reptiles are your design, I will trust your judgement this once, we will do the snake your way, but please consider legs next time. Now get out of here before I change my mind…I still thinks its Creepy” The supervisor shudders.

Zebon gets up to leave thanking the supervisor for his chance to prove himself and the supervisor goes back to reviewing the papers on his desk. Then a thought strikes him as Zebon footsteps are echoing down the corridor.

“JUST FOR GODS SAKE DON’T GIVE IT TEETH!”

So he picked up the rifle and looked through the sight in the direction of his house.

""Yeah, I can see my house all right. ""This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom"".

""Ha Ha, I can see she's naked!! Wait a minute, that's my neighbor in there with her......He's naked, too!!! The bitch!""

He turned to the hit man. “How much do you charge for a hit?""

""I'll do a flat rate, for you: One thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger.""

""Can you do two for me now?""

“Sure, what do you want?”

""First, shoot my wife; she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the mouth. Then the neighbor, he's supposed to be a friend of mine, so just shoot his dick off to teach him a lesson.""

The hit man took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a few minutes.
