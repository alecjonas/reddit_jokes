As he reflects on his sad, lonely existence, a beautiful, busty young lady, in a very skimpy bikini, is walking past. 

She sees him - a small, limbless blob - out the corner of her eye. He gives her a smile and she smiles back. And then, she starts walking over to him!

As she approaches he thinks to himself - “maybe this is it!” She gets nearer and nearer,  her smile growing with each step, until she is right next to him. She leans down, gives him
a big kiss on the cheek, and whispers in his ear: “Have you ever been fucked?”

Excitedly, the man responds “no!”

The woman replies “well you’re fucked now, mate. The tide’s coming in.”","A man with no arms and no legs is sitting on the beach, thinking deeply about his life.",298

So the man puts his penis into the woman's vagina and thrusts it in and out until he gets really excited and then he squirts his sperm which is his seed into the the woman's vagina. The sperm then swim up the vagina and through the cervix and into the uterus where the woman has an ova which is like an egg and then one sperm usually enters the ova and fertilizes it which starts the beginning of a baby. The this little thing grows and grows inside the woman's womb and then after nine months it is ready to come out. So the woman goes to the hospital and they take care of her while she goes into labour and the baby moves down her birth canal which is her womb and vagina and after a long time the baby finally comes out of the woman's vagina and that is where you came from"".

The vendor thought he was out of his mind, but he was used to people asking for outrageous prices, so he played along. ""That's much too low. I'll give it to you for $16,"" he said.

""No,"" said the man firmly. ""$5.""

""Okay sir I'm sorry but that's just too low,"" said the vendor, taking the umbrella into his hands and opening it up, trying to show it off. ""I'll bring it down to $12,"" he said.

But the man refused, adamant on his five dollars.

At this point the vendor was fuming. ""Sir you're asking for a completely ridiculous price."" he said, closing the umbrella and raising his voice. ""I'll bump it down to $8, but never in my life have I sold an umbrella for less than that.""

""No, I will not take it for anything more than $5,"" said the man.

The vendor, positively enraged, threw the umbrella at the man. ""Fuck you and your five dollars, you can have it for free!"" he shouted.

The two had retired as players the year before and had just finished their first full season as members of the staff - Musial as vice president, Schoendienst as a coach - and they decided to take a couple of weeks and go all around the UK.  They landed in London, went up and through Scotland, and were spending a night in Wales.  As they had gone, a few people happily recognized Red, mainly American tourists, but Stan was something else. 

Everywhere the 4 of them went, the people just seemed to automatically get a great affection for him.  Whether it was Americans on vacation as well, or well-to-do Londoners or blue-collar workers in the Black Country or farmers in Scotland, he somehow just was able to create an automatic rapport with everyone.

And so it was, this night in Wales.  The two couples were sitting at a table in a night club, enjoying a couple drinks and the music being performed there.  After a little while, this 20-something crooner came out and the four of them were amazed at this young man's awesome voice.  After he was done, Red and Stan wanted to offer some kind words to him, so Stan talked to the manager and after a moment or two, the manager brought them backstage to meet the singer, a young man named Tom Jones.

Red and Stan introduced themselves to the Welshman, who had heard of the two future Hall of Famers, but was surprised that a pair of American sports stars had wanted to meet him, just some young guy singing in a club.  Nonsense, they told him.  They had seen that he had a special talent, and that, with hard work and a little luck, he could be a huge star.

The young man thanked them and they talked for about another 15 minutes before Stan and Red asked Tom to join them and their wives for a drink.  He thought for a moment and then agreed.

It was here that Tom noticed that all the staff were so nice to Stan.  The servers, who were occasionally a little preoccupied, were acting like he was a favorite uncle.  The bartender was already on a first-name basis with him.  Even the manager, who Tom had known for over a year and just started to warm up to him, was openly friendly with the American baseball star.  Tom was stunned by this change of attitude in everyone and pulled Red aside for a moment to ask him about it:

""Red, you and Stan never were here before, right?""

""Right.""

""Then how come everyone seems to be on such good terms with Stan?""

""It's just something with him.  That happens everywhere we go.  It's been like that for years.  There's just something about his personality.  He said his father was like that as well.""

""Wow, Red.  That must be something amazing.  It just seems so strange to me to be able to make people that happy that fast.""

Red Schoendienst put his arm around the young singer and chuckled and told him:

""Ah, you see, Tom Jones, it's not un-Musial to be loved by anyone.""","In 1964, a couple of former St. Louis Cardinals baseball stars were on vacation in Wales....",5

The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""

""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.

The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""

""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want r/prequelmemes down the street"".

""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.

""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".

""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""

The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""

The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""

The fisherman nods.

The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""

The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".

The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night.

In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!

Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.

I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”

The husband took a quick breath and continued, “She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…” “Do you have anything else that your wife doesn’t use?”","One day, a wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

An american with a carrier in spec ops, a tragic story following a psychotic breakdown and several opened dossiers on the FBI desks, wanted in 67 countries and currently working in China as a killer.

An ex british spy, a traitor. Slender, precise, mannered and deadly as a poisoned dart. He travels the world even though every european state would give millions to the man that would find him and kill him. Not one that even tries, though.

A retired russian soldier, whose battle wounds left him covered with scars, almost deaf but trained him as the perfect killing machine, a one man army that doesn't even need orders to do the right thing: kill everything and everyone if asked.

""The final test"" the three are told ""is to enter this three rooms. Kill all the men in the first one, comb the mane of the lion in the second one, and rape the little girl in the last one""

The USA guy easily kills all the men in the first one suffering just a few minor cuts on an arm. After that he leaves the lion with a nice braided mane. But when it come to the little girl to rape, he refuses and goes away.

The brit manages to talk the guy in the first room into committing suicide. Then he proceeds to give the lion a shampoo. But again, when it comes to raping a child he snaps and goes away.

The russian guy enters the first room. Screams and grunts, then nothing more. After some the killing he exits with a horrible expression on his face ""boring job"" he says. He goes to the second room and after a few roar all that is heard is wailing sounds and a rythmic panting. Then he exit and says ""where is the little girl?

Here's how it goes. ***

I picked up a hitch hiker the other day. I guess you could say she was a bag lady. She wasn't dressed very well and smelled a bit. She had this bag that she held close to her the whole time she was in my truck. I kept wondering what it was but she didn't seem too friendly so I was thinking I'd better not ask.

After a while I was able to get a little small talk out of her and finally my curiosity got the best of me. I said ""whatcha got in the bag?"" and in a blink of an eye she snapped.

""NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!!""

I was shocked and a bit angered but we continued on for about another 20 minutes before we got to where she wanted  me to drop her off. 

The funny thing was, after traveling for another 30 minutes or so I looked down on the floor and noticed she had forgotten her bag in my truck. 

***My bos says ""what was in the bag?""

I shouted in a crazed voice***

A traveling salesman was driving into a new town and prospect, when he passes a sign that says “ Sunnyvale Farms! Peaches, any flavor”. Upon reading the sign, he thinks to himself “These rednecks are some seriously dumb folks. A peach is a peach! What’s that “any flavor” BS about?

So, over the next few days as he commutes into and out of town, back and forth from his hotel or when he goes out to eat – he keeps seeing that darn sign.

Finally, after seeing and reading this sign for three days, curiosity gets that best of him and he decides to go and check the place out.

When he arrives at Sunnyvale Farms, he sees a fruit stand out front, with nothing but peaches. Oh! I get it, he thinks – all they have is peaches and this is just a gimmick.

He gets out of his car and walks up to the fruit stand, and says to the man behind the fruit “Hi, I’ve been seeing your sign the past couple of days. Is it true that you have peaches in any flavor?”

“Uh-huh. Yup, we sure do!” the farmer said

“Really? Well I say bullshit! A peach is a peach!”

“Nope, it’s all real!” says the farmer.

“Okay, gimme a peach that taste like chocolate!”

So, the farmer reaches down into a basket and hands the salesman a peach. The salesman takes a bite and DAMN if it doesn’t take like chocolate. “Wow!” he exclaims “That is some good chocolate!”

“Yup! I know” says the farmer

“Ok, gimme a peach that taste like a strawberry!”

Farmer digs into another basket and hands over another peach “Here ya go!”

Salesman bites into it, and sure enough – it tastes like a strawberry. “Shit! How do you do this?”

“It’s a secret”

“Ok. I got you now. I bet you don’t have a peach that tastes like peanut butter and jelly!” 

“Sure do. Here ya go! Try this one!” 

Salesman bites into the new peach and damned if he does not taste the peanut butter. “I taste the peanut butter, but where’s the jelly?”

“Turn it around!”

Salesman does and takes another bite and YES, there’s the jelly! “This is incredible! I don’t know how you do it, but this is amazing”

After some silence, the salesman looks around to make sure no one else is around – then says to the farmer “I bet you don’t have one that taste like pussy!”

The farmer winks at him, grabs another peach and hands it over with a grin on his face.

The salesman takes a bite. Screams in disgust and spits it out. “What the fuck? This one taste like SHIT!”

Farmer says… “TURN IT AROUND!”",Sunnyvale Farms - PEACHES ANY FLAVOR (long),8

Nothing was too big or small, and nothing was off limits.

The family consisted of a mother (Linda), father (Robert) and 3 sons (Robert Jr., Louis &amp; Clarence). Robert Jr. and Louis were in their late twenties and intelligent beyond their years. They were primed to lead the family when the time came. Clarence wasn’t as smart or successful as his older brothers, but he strived to prove everyone wrong. He wanted to help lead this family into the future alongside his brothers.

Linda and Robert tasked the three brothers with purchasing three more companies to put under the family umbrella. They each had a budget of $50 million and set out on their own paths to make their parents proud. They were given 7 days to acquire their respective businesses.

Clarence ran out of the room as fast as he could, jumped in his Porsche and took off. He already had a place in mind. He heard about a massive new Waste Disposal company that just moved into town last year. They were known for their environmentally friendly practices and the company was already  profitable. It was perfect.

After 7 days, a family meeting was held where each of the brothers were to present and introduce their newest acquisitions. Robert Jr. insisted he go first. He proudly stated, “Mother, father, I’ve taken an up-and-coming lumber yard, as you can see on my chest. It’s called Alpha Lumber.” He points to his left chest and shows off his new polo shirt with the Alpha Lumber logo beautifully showcased. Louis insisted he presented next, “Nicely done, brother,” he says, “but it’s not as promising as mine. Mother, father, I’ve taken a software and technology company, as you can see on my chest. It’s called GigaBite and is projected to rival Microsoft within the decade.” He points to his own chest, revealing the new GigaBite logo.

Clarence, eager to prove himself nearly cut his brother off so he could take the floor. He began,

At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars.

The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.

At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. 

 When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice.

When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.

""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?""

One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about.
The letter read:
Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had £100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension cheque.
Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner.
Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.
Can you please help me?
Sincerely,
Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few pounds. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.
The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.
It read:
Dear God, 
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

The King wasn't just going to allow anybody to marry his daughter so he came up with an idea. In 2 weeks time there was to be a contest to see  who would earn the right to marry her. People all across the land flocked to the castle on a quest to marry the princess. 

2 weeks passed and the day had finally arrived. The King stood in front of the huge crowd that had assembled and said ""You have come here to earn the right to marry my daughter but in order to do so you must complete 3 extremely dangerous tasks:

1) Jump over a 5 foot high barbwire fence.

2) Swim through the lake of no return filled with all kinds of creatures. 

3) Have sex with the royal cow.

...and you must do all of it completely naked."" 

After hearing this only 3 men were brave enough to step forward and take on this quest. They all disrobed and drew straws to decide who would go first.

The first man was nervous. He tried to jump over the barbwire fence but didn't make it and cut off his balls. 

After seeing this the second man was scared to death. Nevertheless he ran as fast as he could and jumped over the barbwire fence. Then he swam about halfway across the lake of no return and got eaten by a giant alligator. 

There was only one person left and he was terrified. Somehow he summoned up the courage. It took everything he had but he jumped over the barbwire fence, swam across the lake of no return, and then humped the royal cow. 

The King said ""You have done well sir but to marry my daughter you must complete all 3 tasks AGAIN!""

Now the man was angry. He jumped over the barbwire fence, swam across the lake of no return, and then humped the royal cow once more.

The King was very impressed. He smiled and stood in front of the man and said ""You have earned the right to marry my daughter.""

The man looked back at him and said.....

""How much for the cow?""",The Quest for the Princess,3

The first thing he said was “a good joke is a lot like sex, it shouldn’t be forced”, now obviously I didn’t know what that meant, but I figured i’d find out later so it didn’t matter

Now, the next thing he said was, “you should treat your audience like you would treat a stop sign”, I was a bit confused so I asked him, “What do you mean dad”, to which he answered, “Just ignore them”

In my mind I was thinking, “man, this advice is golden”, but then he said,“son listen up, this last part is the most important, there is a fine line between being funny and being a joke, make sure you can find that line” 

I said, “ok, but what line is that”

Dr. Young, who was positive that this old geezer didn’t know beans about medicine, thought this would be a great opportunity to win $1000.  He went to Dr. Geezer’s clinic and says, “Dr. Geezer, I have lost all taste in my mouth.  Can you please help me?”

Dr. Geezer calls out, “Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Dr. Young’s mouth.”

Dr. Young yells, “Aaagh!  This is gasoline!”

Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations!  You’ve got your taste back, that will be $500.”

Dr. Young gets annoyed and returns a couple days later with another plan to recover his money.  He enters the clinic and says, “I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything.”

Dr. Geezer calls out, “Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Dr. Young’s mouth.”

Dr. Young yells, “Oh no you don’t, that’s gasoline!”

Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations, you’ve got your memory back, that will be $500.”

Dr. Young, angry after losing $1000, comes back after several more days.  He enters the clinic and says, “My eyesight has become weak, I cannot see anything!”

Dr. Geezer replies, “Well, I don’t have any medicine for that, so here’s your $1000 back,” and hands Dr. Young a $10 bill.

Dr. Young quickly yells, “Hey, this is only $10!”

Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations, you’ve got your vision back, that will be $500.”",Dr. Geezer,34

post,dzqn1o,2qh72,jokes,false,1574373040,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dzqn1o/bob_goes_to_the_zoo/,self.jokes,,"One day, Bob decided to go to the zoo.  When he got to the ape cage, he found himself looking at a big male ape, who was staring right back at him.  When he scratched his head, so did the ape.  

Noticing this, Bob decided to have some fun.  So he started to scratch under his arms and jump around saying ""ooooh oooh oooh"" and so did the ape.  

Stopping to think about what to do next, Bob scratched his chin, as he was thinking.  Before he could even react, the ape pulled the bars of his cage apart, jumped the moat, and proceeded to beat the ever living shit out of him,

A few weeks later, Bob comes to in a hospital room, in full traction.  When they realized that he was awake, the staff brought a man into his room, and left the two of them alone.

""Mr. Smith, my name is Albert.  I am the zookeeper and I want to see if we can figure out what happened before you were attacked.""

""I....don't know.  I was looking at the ape, and noticed he was mimicking my movements.""

""I need to know exactly what you did.""

""Well, when I first noticed it, I was scratching my head.  When I noticed he was scratching his head, I started to play around, and I started to scratch my underarms and make oooh sounds.""

""OK, then what happened?""

""Well, I was trying to think of something else to do, and I think I scratched my chin, which is the last thing I remember.""

""You scratched you chin???   Oh that explains everything!  You see, in Ape, that means 'Go fuck yourself'.  Thank God, because if the attack was unprovoked, we'd have to shoot him.""

So the zookeper left Bob to sit in traction for another six months, and if you've ever been in a cast, you can only imagine the misery of six months of not being able to move, shit or pee, or even get to that one itch, without someone elses help.  It wears on a man.  So Bob spent all that time coming up with a plan to get his revenge on that damned ape.

He's finally released from the hospital, and makes his first trip to the local butcher, where he buys a giant polish sausage, and a pair of nice new butcher knives.  

He then goes straight to the zoo, and marches up to the ape cage, where he is soon standing face to face with his attacker.

""Remember me?"" He asked as he got the apes attention, and saw that he was once again mimicking him.  He smiled and reached into his bag, and tossed a butcher knife into the apes cage.  

When the ape picked it up, Bob got his attention, by holding his own knife high, while he reached into his pants, and pulled the polish sausage out through the fly.  Just as he expected, the ape mimicked him, holding his knife high, and his junk in his other hand.

Seeing this, Bob sliced down with his big butcher knife, cleanly cutting the polish sausage in half.   Seeing the sausage laying on the ground, he looked up smugly to see how much pain the poor dumb ape must be in right now... where he saw him standing there, scratching his chin.",Bob goes to the zoo,23

Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Syria. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Syrian Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE!

“I’ve got to get this guy!” The coach said to himself. “He has the perfect arm!”

So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Lions go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Syrian is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.

“Mom,” he says into the phone, “I just won the Super Bowl!”

“I don’t want to talk to you,” the old Muslim woman says. “You deserted us. You are not my son!”

“I don’t think you understand, Mother,” the young man pleads. “I’ve won the greatest sporting event in the world. I’m here among thousands of my adoring fans.”

“No! Let me tell you!” his mother retorts. “At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn’t get raped!”

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,287

The guy said, “My name is Penis van Lesbian.”

The agent said, “Sir, I hate to tell you this, but in order to get into Hollywood, you are going to have to change your name.”

“I will not change my name! The van Lesbian name is centuries old, I will not disrespect my grandfather by changing my name. Not ever.”

The agent said, “Sir, I have worked in Hollywood for years you will never go far with a name like Penis van Lesbian! I’m telling you, you will have to change your name or I will not be able to represent you.” “So be it! I guess we will not do business together” the guy said and he left the agent’s office.

Five years later the agent opens an envelope sent to his office. Inside the envelope is a letter and a check for $50,000. The agent is awe-struck, who would possibly send him $50,000? He reads the letter enclosed.

“Dear Sir, Five years ago, I came into your office wanting to become an actor in Hollywood, you told me I needed to change my name. Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said and I decided you were right, I had to change my name. I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed cheque is a token of my appreciation.

Thank you for your advice.

Sincerely,

Dick van Dyke.","A man walked into an agent’s office in Hollywood and said “I want to be a movie star.” Tall, handsome and with experience on Broadway, he had the right credentials.",134

That was my cousin and I'm going to give you two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have sex.""

After considering briefly, Frank decided to accept the latter alternative. So the black bear has his way with Frank. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip back to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead.

Right after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him. The grizzly said, ""That was a big mistake, Frank. That was my cousin and you've got two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have rough sex.""

Again, Frank thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death. So the grizzly has his way with Frank. Although he survived, it took several months before Frank fully recovered.

Now Frank is completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there.

The polar bear looked at him and said, ""Admit it Frank, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?""",Frank was excited about his new rifle and decided to try bear hunting.....,403

My first thought was SEE vs HEAR a joke? So, I told her ""Yea, sure - show me!""

She pulled out two pennies and put them FACE UP on the bar between us and asked ""Do you see two cars?""

I looked down and after looking and looking (and not finding) I told her ""No, no cars.""

She said, ""yes there are - two LINCOLNS""

""Ah"" I said "" I got it. Two Lincolns because of the heads on the coins. ""Ok.""

Then she asked ""Do you see two snakes?""

Down I look at the coins again and try as I might... I see NO SNAKES. I tell her ""Nope, no snakes.""

She laughs and tells me ""You're not trying hard enough! There are two COPPERHEADS!!!""

""Aww man! You got me again. Yup there are two copper heads there"" the copper heads on Lincoln

I think I got her beat this time and I ask her  ""Is there anything else to look for?""

She takes a drink and turns to me ""Look again and tell me if you see my pussy""

I looked at her... shocked, but again - I look at the two pennies, searching for the answer to this riddle.

He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""",An old dime store novel writer walks into a saloon...,655
