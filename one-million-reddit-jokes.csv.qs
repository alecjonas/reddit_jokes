l bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.”

The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.”

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.”

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

“Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

“Are you okay?” the auditor asks.

“Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it!”","The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office.",124

He saw that a school was looking for a bus driver, so he called and was asked to come for an interview. He got the job, and was surprised when he went out and found that the bus was garishly painted with Big Bird, Bert &amp; Ernie, and Elmo. Still, a job's a job, he thought.

As he went about his route, he stopped and picked up twin girls. These girls were rather portly, and as they entered the bus the first one said, ""My name's Patty."" The man asked the second twin her name and she said, ""My name's Patty also.""

Further along, there was a boy who was trying to put on a James Dean-esque cool image. As he got on the bus, he said, ""Yo! I'm Leonard T."" He sat in the seat right behind the driver, so the driver could see him in his mirror.

They were almost back to the school, and made one last stop. The kid who got on announced, ""I'm Ross... and I'm special.""

As they made their way back to the school, the driver noticed to his disgust that the kid sitting right behing him had removed one shoe to reveal a horrible case of bunions, which he was picking at.

As soon as they got to school, the man went to the principal's office, threw down the bus keys on his desk, and announced he was quitting. ""Is something wrong?"" asked the principal?

""I can't take this!"" yelled the man. ""I've got two all beef Pattys, special Ross, Leonard T. picking bunions on a Sesame Street bus!""

Eventually one wounded Pakistani fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his Commander, ""Don't send anymore men, its a trap...there's two of them!""",A large group of Pakistani soldiers...,28

They run to the house seeking shelter and nourishment.
They ring the doorbell of the house, and a HUGE, UGLY, NASTY BITCH answers the door.
One gathers the courage to speak, and says ""May we please have some water""?

One man is selected as the candidate.
He slips into the room she has entered, to find her naked on the bed with her legs spread wide open. Cobwebs, spiders, dirt, and a strange odor resembling gangrene infection accompany her large thighs. 
The man regurgitates on the floor silently. While on the floor, he sees a basket of husked corn by the bed. An idea sparks.
He grabs an ear of corn, shoves it in and out 3 times, then chucks it out the open window. 
He repeats that action 4 times. She stands up, exhausted, and escorts him outside.

He has tractor miniatures, a tractor wall calendar and even tractor simulator software installed on his computer. Tractors are his one true passion in life! Joe is walking down the lan one morning, enjoying the fresh air. He hears the familiar rumble of an engine and before he knows it, the brand new 2016 John Deere tractor is driving round the corner. It's only been out a couple of months, and Joe hasn't seen one out and about before! He's very excited. The tractor drives towards him, all beautiful and green. Once it reaches Joe, it pulls to a stop beside him and the driver hops down from the cab.

""Listen mate, I'm in a bit of a pickle! My wife has just gone into labour, and the fastest way for me to get to her is to run across that field."" The farmer gestures to a field behind him.

Joe's face lights up with glee ""It would be an honour mate, I'll take good care of it!"" The farmer vaults the field gate and sprints away shouting ""Thank you"" as he goes.

Joe strolls around the tractor, appreciating it from all angles. He thinks to himself: ""what harm would it do if I took it for a little spin?"" This may be the only chance he ever gets to drive a tractor outside of his simulator software! He pops up into the cab, and turns the key. The engine roars to life and Joe is on his way. He can't disguise his excitement as he works his way up through the gears. In no time, Joe is up to the top speed of 25 mph. Joe approaches a bend, but it's sharper than he expects, he rounds it going too fast and slides of the road, crashing into a tree. At first Joe is in shock, but then smoke starts pouring from the engine, and then he really begins to panic. He is absolutely desolate and beyond reason: Joe has just crashed a tractor, his one true passion in life.

Joe finds himself back at home, still in an emotional state. He tears down his tractor calendar and bins his prize tractor miniatures. Joe uninstalls the simulator software, and consoles himself by pouring a large measure of whiskey. Then another and another.

Day after day this goes on. His wife leaves him and he stops going to work. The drink consumes him as his depression spirals.

Joe is propping up the bar in his local and he's a few pints down. Lot's of people have lit up cigarettes around him and it's getting very smokey. The barman is coughing away, really struggling with the smoke. Joe looks up and for the first time since the crash feels something other than misery. He feels sympathetic.

""Listen pal,"" Joe says to the barman, ""would you like me to do something about all this smoke?""

The barman replies kindly ""I don't know that anything can be done, but thanks all the same.""

All of a sudden, Joe stands up on his bar stool, and takes a deep lungful of air, sucking up all of the smoke in the room. As the room clears, the whole bar stops and stares at him. Mutters of ""What the hell was that?"", and ""Bloody hell, that was incredible"" circulate the room. In response Joe shrugs and says ""I'm an ex-tractor fan"".","There's a man, let's call him Joe, and he loves tractors.",2

""What!? What did you do then?"", asked the man, now very engaged in the doctor's story.

""Well, then what?"", interjected the man impatiently. 

""I remembered that I had taken my umbrella with me, and as I got it out the bear arose on its two hind feet and roared at me!

Miraculously, my umbrella had fired at this bear, and it laid there, lifeless, in front of me!"" 

The old man looked at the doctor for a moment, and then broke out in a cry of laughter. ""Ha! Are you mad!? That's nonsense!"", said the man with a smug and clever expression upon his face.

This killer has been at large for some time and has a particularity sadistic method of murdering his victims, he kills them by making thousands of tiny cuts all over their bodies until they pass out from pain and die of blood loss. 

The killer made his first strike by killing the coroner in charge of autopsies for the department. And so to investigate, a new coroner and his assistant were brought in from upstate to perform the autopsy. Upon investigation of the body, the new coroner discovered that the cuts were so precise and thin, that they could only have been made with a diamond tipped blade. The coroner remarked to his assistant about the extravagance of the suspected weapon like so, ""wow, assistant,"" he said, ""this weapon must have been diamond tipped to make cuts so thin and precise!"" 

Two days later he was dead. 

Upon investigation of THIS coroner's body, the assistant, who was now in charge of autopsies for the department in wake of his boss's death, noticed that the cuts were pretty small and fairly precise, so much so that they could only have been made by an obsidian blade, like a scalpel maybe. He remarked to himself, ""Wow, these cuts are fairly precise and pretty small, I can only conclude that an obsidian blade, like a scalpel maybe, was used!"" 

The next day he was dead. 

Upon investigation of HIS body, the chief of police, who was in charge of the autopsy, since they couldn't find anyone more qualified in the area, noticed that the cuts were sort of messy, and had small hints of iron oxide in them. They could only have been make with a rusted blade. He said to his head detective, who was also in the room, ""head detective, I'm no expert at autopsies, but I recognize some iron oxide here, and I can only conclude that they must have been made with a rusted blade""

""That's strange,"" said the head detective, ""I thought this killer was using high end blades to do his killing. If this *is* the same killer, why would he be using such poor quality weapons this time?""

""Well,"" replied the chief, looking up from the body on the table, ""I guess he's just cutting coroners""


BONUS FACT: Yes, obsidian blades are used to make some scalpels, obsidian can be cut real thin yo!

The neighbors next door politely ignored her crying, trying their best to respect her grieving. However, their seven year old son was perplexed by her behavior.

One day, while waiting for the bus, the boy saw the widow doing her usual wailing. Overcome with curiosity, he walked over to her and tugged on her sleeve.

""Ma'am, why are you sad?""

He tries desperately to remember, but before he can even paint the thirty minutes is up.

The professor walks over to judge the quality of each artist's work.  He seems impressed by the first two, but is visibly stunned upon seeing the third student's painting.

The third student, utterly ashamed, is about to explain why he didn't paint anything.  To his surprise, the professor's worrying expression morphs into tears of joy, and triumphantly declares the third student the winner.

In the midst of the crowds resounding cheers, the flabbergasted student asks the professor ""Why?  I didn't even paint anything!""

post,5flvcm,2qh72,jokes,false,1480459690,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5flvcm/archery_practice/,self.jokes,,"Dave and Mr Shambles were out on a weekend for a good session of archery. Mr Shambles had just been promoted over Dave and thought he'd make it up to him.

The course consisted of three targets, which got further and further from the shooter as you went up the course. 

Now Mr Shambles was having a difficult time landing his shots. And on the other hand, was of course, Dave.

Dave shot his first three shots at the target, and all three landed right in the golden part.

'How on earth are you doing that?' asked Mr Shambles.

'Shoot at the target five times. I promise you that you fifth shot will hit,' Dave answered with his vast wisdom.

Now Mr Shambles knew Dave. A lot of the things Dave said were  pretty r/nottheonion so Mr Shambles shot five times at the target. To his surprise, the fifth shot hit the target.

Before Mr Shambles could comment on how he thought that it was just coincidence that his fifth shot had hit the target, Dave was shooting his third arrow on the second target, and it hit, just like the previous two shots.

Mr Shambles gave Dave a hopeless look as he lifted his own bow.

'Give it four shots this time. Trust me.'

So Mr Shambles got to it and his forth shot, as told by Dave, landed. Dave tapped Mr Shambles on the shoulder and nodded before moving to the third and final target.

Now Mr Shambles realised that the target this time was actually very far from the two indeed. He began to consider the possibility that Dave may actually miss a shot or two.

'I'm going to miss my third shot,' said Dave. 'But I'm sure that you expected for me to tell you that you will be able to hit the target on your third shot. But because I will miss this third shot, you will be able to hit the target in only two shots.'

Now Mr Shambles was perplexed with this ideology.  But he went with it. And surprise, surprise - Dave missed his third shot, and Mr Shambles hit the target with his second.

'That's ridiculous!' said Mr Shambles.

'Oh, you really are silly, Shambles. Go and have a look at the targets!'

So Mr Shambles walked to the final target. 

THEN HE TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE. ",Archery Practice,3

Martha knew that George was ""the one"", but she wanted to save herself for marriage.  After they graduated high school the big wedding day arrived.  After the ceremony they left the church and were driving to the airport for their honeymoon in Paris when the car hit an icy patch and slammed into a tree.

Martha awoke in a beautiful hotel suite with a well-dressed young man standing at the foot of her bed.  She began to panic, but the young man spoke.  ""Please be calm, Martha.  I have terrible and wonderful news.  The terrible news is that you were killed in an automobile accident.  The wonderful news is that you were such a perfect Christian, you are now in heaven reliving your perfect day.  By the way, I'm Jesus Christ, and I'll be your hotel concierge for eternity.""

He walked to the window and pulled the shade, revealing a stunning view of the Paris skyline.  The Eiffel Tower dominated the view from the window.  ""Every day you will celebrate your honeymoon.  The entire city of Paris is open to your every whim.""

""That's wonderful,"" Martha replied, ""but what about George?  It wouldn't be the same without him here.""

""George survived the accident, so he's still on Earth.  Of course he's grieving for you terribly, but he's scheduled to have a long and healthy life.  When he passes you'll be able to spend eternity with each other.  Oh, and don't worry, he will remain loyal to you to his dying day.""

""Well, Heaven won't be perfect without him,"" Martha thought, ""but at least I'll be able to pass my days in paradise.  And when he does die, we'll be able to spend eternity together.""

Days turned to months, and months turned into years.  Martha explored every nook and cranny of this Paradise Paris.  The people were friendly, everybody wore berets, and baguettes and fine wine were available on every corner.  She knew this wasn't what Paris was really like, but she assumed that since this was her ideal version, it would be as she wanted it to be.

After a few months she started noticing hairs on the pillow next to her when she would awaken.  Each day there were more and more hairs.  Curious, she hit the call button on her phone and Jesus walked in the door.  ""What seems to be the matter, Mrs. Wilson?""

""Nothing's the matter, really; I'm just curious about something.""  She indicated the hairs on the pillow of her bed.

""Oh yes, Mrs. Wilson,"" Jesus said.  ""You see, your husband is suffering from premature baldness.  The hair you are seeing is the part of him that is no longer alive, and it is showing up in heaven.  When he arrives the hair will be back on his head, and he'll have the luxurious mane you remembered him for.""

Martha thought about George losing his hair and hoped that it wouldn't adversely affect him in life.  She closed her eyes and uttered a silent prayer that his friends and business associates would not look down on him due to the loss of his locks.

Jesus (because he was Jesus) heard her silent prayer.  He put a reassuring hand on her shoulder.  ""I assure you, Mrs. Wilson, that George will not only suffer no negative effects from his hair loss, but he'll appear quite distinguished.  If anything, this will help him in life.  If you would like, I can take the hair away and put it in storage until the Big Day.""

""No, that's all right,"" Martha stated.  ""Just leave it in a dish by the bedside so that when I feel lonely I can run my hands through his hair.""

Several more months passed.  One day Martha awoke to feel something under the covers at the foot of the bed.  She pulled back the sheets and was astonished to find two human toes laying there.  She screamed.

Jesus rushed through the door.  ""What seems to be the problem, Mrs. Wilson?""

""There are two toes in my bed!""

""Oh yes, Mrs. Wilson.  My apologies, I should have mentioned this before.  Last night, George's car broke down in the middle of the woods and he was forced to hike for several miles in the snow before he was found.  As a result he contracted frostbite in the two small toes of his left foot.  I assure you, however, that he's expected to make a full recovery.""

Martha closed her eyes and uttered a silent prayer that George would not suffer unduly.

Jesus (because he was Jesus) heard her silent prayer.  He put a reassuring hand on her shoulder.  ""I assure you, Mrs. Wilson, that George will be perfectly fine.  He will have to walk with a cane, but there are no other negative effects.  Also I should mention that every day he pines for you, and he has remained constant and loyal all these years.  If you would like, I can take these toes away and put them in storage until the Big Day.""

Martha agreed, and Jesus brushed the toes into his hand and stepped out of the door.

Years passed.  One day Martha awoke and noticed that there was a giant mound under the blankets next to her.  She pulled back the sheets and was aghast to discover a human pelvis laying in the bed.  She screamed.

Jesus rushed through the door.  ""What seems to be the problem, Mrs. Wilson?""

""There's a... pelvis in my bed!""

""Oh yes, Mrs. Wilson.  I'm sorry to inform you that your dear George was taking a shower yesterday when he slipped and fell, shattering his pelvis.  However he's been fitted with a prosthetic hip and is expected to make a full recovery, and still has several long productive years on earth.  And every day he pines for you.""

Martha closed her eyes and uttered a silent prayer.  Jesus (because he was Jesus) heard the prayer.

*""Penis cancer.  Penis cancer.  Penis cancer.""*

They laughed, cried and grew up together. However, what truly sealed their friendship was their undying admiration to chess.


 Thomas and Robert were both fantastic chess players, but, no matter what, Thomas always ended up beating Robert. 


It was one of the two long running jokes among their relationship that he would always lose, the other being Thomas' current girlfriend, Maria, had dumped Robert the night before were to have sex when they used to be together.


One day, after a long, grueling chess match, Robert had lost to Thomas, again.


""That's it. Literally 0 - 424 to me, I’m done. How do you always out play me?"" said Robert.


""Wanna hear a secret, a friendly guide to chess? Three simple steps?"" spoke Thomas, softly, as he leaned in.


Robert leaned before muffling a ""Mhm.""


Thomas descended into a hushed whisper, ""Right, you have to check all these boxes: First, read the trilogy of Master's Chess.""


""Ok.""


""Secondly, memorize all the possible routes from the start to the finish of a Chess game.""


""Right, and...?""


""Thirdly, this is the most important thing mate, don’t tell anyone understand?” Robert nodded “... finish what you started and finally fuck my girlfriend!"" 


Thomas then erupted into a bawling mess, he fell off his chair in hysteria. Robert stormed off, furious at his friend for leading him on.


The next day once again they were playing Chess, ignoring the events that transpired the previous day.


The game was ridiculously close, they were equal on points, but Robert, dripping with sweat of concentration, knew he was outplaying Thomas on positioning and fortification. 


After many long calculated decisions, Robert was one move from bringing home the glory.


""Checkmate."" said Robert 


All went quiet. The crystal silence was finally shattered by Thomas erupting in confusion


""How did you do that?""


""I listened to your advice."" replied Robert triumphantly.


""What advice? The stuff yesterday...?""


""Mhm.""


""Man, come on. Let me list it out for you. You're telling me you read the trilogy of Master's Chess?""


""That box on the list is checked.""


""And you memorized every possible game outcome? There are like billions!""

There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, Cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!

It's obvious that he has taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them. She's immediately touched by the amount of thought he put into organizing the display.

There are small bears all alongThe bottom shelf, Medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and Huge, enormous bears running

She finds it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but don't mention this to him. 

They share a bottle of wine and
continue talking.  After awhile, she finds herself thinking,  ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!  Maybe he could be the future father of my children?"" 
 

She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. 

He responds warmly.  They continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom, where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.
 
 

She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known. 
 

After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.
 

The woman rolls over, gently

There wasn't any serious crime, the pay was good and the hours were easy.  For some reason though, people kept complaining that I was a bad dinosaur.  I didn't understand, but it seemed important to everyone, so I tried to incorporate some dinosaur-like behavior into my work.

I tried growling when I talked to people, but they still complained and mocked me.  I tried wearing a dinosaur mask, eating raw meat and growing my nails out.  Still, complaints and mockery.  It gnawed at me, even though I didn't understand, so I started taking more drastic measures. I needed to be a better dinosaur.

I spent my savings on a full body tattoo of scales.  I had a dentist augment my teeth into fangs.  I stopped wearing clothes and attacked wild animals.  Finally, the mayor came to visit me.

“You've done a great job policing this town and crime is at an all time low, but the people are concerned about your dinosaur behavior.”

“I'm so sorry... I've tried everything to be a good dinosaur, I don't know what else to do,” I growled, stalking back and forth across the room.

“Well, until your dinosaur problem is sorted out, I'm afraid we have to let you go. The town has come together to get you the help you need. We've hired you a personal psychologist and given you paid time off until you're better.”

The psychologist arrived that afternoon.

“The mayor tells me you're great at your job and the people love you, but once you became a cop you started having dinosaur issues.”

I didn't even try to articulate a response.  I had to impress her, get my job back and regain the town's respect.  I had to show her I was a good dinosaur.  I jumped on the desk, naked and covered in scale tattoos, my fangs gleaming and animal blood running down my face.  I roared with all my might.

“Yes, well, we need to identify what triggered this problem.  We're going try some minor role-playing. Try to pretend you just pulled me over for speeding.”

Utterly depressed, I abandoned all my dinosaur mannerisms. I calmly climbed off the desk, walked alongside her chair and said,

“License and registration ma'am.”

“Yes sir, awefulsaur.”

So I ate her.

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.
'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?",Couple wants to get married in heaven,14

The three bucks looked on in amazement.

The 8 pointer says,
'I could probably get by with 4 does...........
Who really needs 10 anyway?'

The 4 pointer says,
'You know.............. come to think of it, I only really use one or two of mine!'

The button buck was silent, as the other two bucks look over to him in confusion.

Suddenly the Button buck runs out into the middle of the field!

He rips and tears up some grass........
pisses all over the place,
snorts &amp; wheezes,
rubs his head raw on a tree,
and chews a lickin branch clean off!

Then he runs back over to his buddies.

The first song is incredible but the owner had never heard it before. He asked what the song was called and the answer shocked him.

""I call it giving my sister ass herpes. I wrote it myself"" said the young man. ""Do you want to hear another song that I wrote called raping my neighbors dog""? The bar owner reluctantly agreed.

The second song was even better than the first. The owner decides to hire the young man. He will let the young man play his own songs but only if he doesn't tell the bar patrons the names of his songs.

Everything was going great on the first night. The bar was packed and the tip jar on the piano was full. The young man announced he was taking a short break and went into the bathroom.

As he does so, the camel whips its head all the way around and bites him in the face.

As he nears, he realises that she is covered in sand up to her neck.  She shouts to him, ""Please! Please dig me out, I'll do anything for you!""  

The man dismounts and starts digging her out.  As he is going along, he notices that, not only is she fit, but her clothing has been damaged in the sandstorm as well.  Advancing to her waistline, she begins to help him, and he sees that her dress has been ripped away, and she's nearly naked.

His one ‘vice’ was his Harley.  He loved riding his Harley.  One day, god decided to reward this man for being such a helping and selfless individual.  The heavens open, golden beams of lights…..

“For your service to humanity I have decided to grant you one request” God says to the man.

“Well, I love riding my motorcycle, and I love Hawaii.  I would like to be able to ride my motorcycle in Hawaii whenever I want to.  I would like a bridge connecting California to Hawaii”

God replies: “I am omnipotent, but to accomplish that, I would need to drain the vast majority of earth’s resources, which would deprive humanity.  Pick something else.”

The man though hard and came up with another idea:

“I want to understand my wife.  I want to know why she feels what she feels, why she thinks like she thinks, why she says one thing and means another.  I want to understand women”

God looks at the businessman with a stern look on his face, and after a long pause he says:

“So, do you want that bridge with two lanes or four?”

She offers a glass of whiskey, and advises that each drink come with a small bowl of cashews, to which he accepts.

He takes a sip of his drink, then all of a sudden hears a voice say to him;
""You smell beautiful today"".

Confused, the man looks around, but cannot tell where the voice came from.

Only a few seconds later, the voice says to him;
""You look amazing at the moment"".

Even more confused, the man seeks out the voice. The man next to him is asleep, the seats in front and behind him are empty.

Brushing it off, the man carries on with his drink.

Yet again, the voice pipes up;
""I love your hairstyle, it really suits you"".

The man, now suitably confused and concerned, beckons over the air hostess, and explains to her what the voice keeps doing.

""Don't worry sir"" she remarks, ""it's just the complimentary nuts"".","A man is on a long haul flight, late at night.",5

Moved to our new home in Minnesota. It is so beautiful here. The landscape is so majestic. Can hardly wait to see it with snow. I love it here.

Oct 14
Minnesota is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turned all the colors and shades of red and orange. Went for a ride through the beautiful country and saw some deer. They are so graceful, certainly they are the most wonderful animal on earth. This must be paradise. I love it here.

Nov 11 
Deer season will start soon. I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill such a gorgeous creature. Hope it will snow soon. I love it here.
 
December 9
We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape.
What a fantastic sight!
Can there be a lovelier place in the whole world?
Moving here was the best idea I've ever had!
Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again.
I did both our driveway and the sidewalks.
This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again.
What a perfect life!
 
December 12
The sun has melted all our lovely snow.
Such a disappointment!
My neighbor tells me not to worry- we'll definitely have a white Christmas.
No snow on Christmas would be awful!
Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again
I don't think that's possible.
Bob is such a nice man, I'm glad he's our neighbor.
 
December 14
Snow, lovely snow! 8 inches last night.
The temperature dropped to -20.
The cold makes everything sparkle so.
The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks.
This is the life!
The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again.
I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way.
I wish l wouldn't huff and puff so.
 
December 15
20 inches forecast.
Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer.
Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels.
Stocked the freezer.
The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out.
I think that's silly.
We aren't in Alaska, after all.
 
December 16
Ice storm this morning.
Fell on my ass on the ice in the driveway putting down salt.
Hurt like hell.
The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel.
 
December 17
Still way below freezing.
Roads are too icy to go anywhere.
Electricity was off for 5 hours.
I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm.
Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her.
Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her.
God I hate it when she's right.
I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own living room.
 
December 20
Electricity's back on, but had another 14 inches of the damn stuff last night.
More shoveling!
Took all day.
The damn snowplow came by twice.
Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey.
I think they're lying.
Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and they're out.
Might have another shipment in March.
I think they're lying.
Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me.
I think he's lying.
 
December 22
Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of the white   shit fell today, and it's so cold, it probably won't melt till August.
Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to piss.
By the time I got undressed, pissed and dressed again. I was too tired to shovel.
Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter, but he says he's too busy.  I think the asshole is lying.
 
December 23
Only 2 inches of snow today 
And it warmed up to 0.
The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning.
What is she, nuts?!!
Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago?
She says she did but I think she's lying.
 
December 24
6 inches - Snow packed so hard by snowplow, l broke the shovel.
Thought I was having a heart attack.
If I ever catch the son of a bitch who drives that snow plow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls and beat him to death with my broken shovel.
I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been!
Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the damn snowplow.
 
December 25
Merry freaking Christmas!
20 more inches of the damn slop tonight -Snowed in.
The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil.
God, I hate the snow!
Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel.
The wife says I have a bad attitude.
I think she's an idiot.
If I have to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" one more time, I'm going to stuff her into the microwave.
 
December 26
Still snowed in.
Why the hell did I ever move here?
It was all HER idea.
She's really getting on my nerves.
 
December 27
Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze; plumber came after 14 hours of waiting for him, he only charged me $1,400 to replace all my pipes.
 
December 28
Warmed up to above -20.
Still snowed in.
The BITCH is driving me crazy!!!
 
December 29
10 more inches.
Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in.
That's the silliest thing I ever heard.   How dumb does he think I am?
 
Dec 30
Finally out of the house today. Went to the store to get food and on the way back a darned deer ran in front of the car and I hit it. Did about $3,000 damage to the car. Those friggin beasts should be killed. Wish the hunters had killed ALL of them last November.

December 31
Roof caved in.
 
January 1
I set fire to what's left of the house.
No more shoveling. Took the car to the garage in town. Would you believe the thing is rusting out from that lousy salt they put all over the road.

January 5

Shortly after, a tall man stepped up and was ready for his throw. The man with the apple on his head didn't look nervous one bit. 

So with a swift axe throw, the tall man succeeded the challenge, and visibly enraged, the suicidal man was forced to keep his promise.

""I'm Frank Audric."" said the tall man, as he was about to get his check signed.

However, our friend didn't give up, and decided to select someone from the crowd himself. He pointed to an old man and called for him to walk up to the podium. The old man took his shoot bluntly, and to most's surprise, it managed to split the second apple put on our friend's head today.

""I'm Eddie Penham."" said the old man, as he was about to get his check signed.

The suicidal man went to pick another volunteer out of the crowd. This time, he picked an average-looking man with a stubble.

The man stepped up, took his shot, and to everyone's surprise, the axe penetrated the suicidal man's skull. He was left emotionless on the ground. The apple was still split in the process, though.

So the shooter said ""I'm... sorry.""",Apple Archery,0

We believe he frequently underreports the amount of money recovered from crime scenes. He has also recieved more complaints of brutality than any other officer in the department. And finally, as you know, he shot an unarmed man last week, claiming the suspect was trying to grab his service weapon, despite contradictory forensic evidence. You told the lead detective that you didn't see what happened, but today a witness turned in cell phone video of the incident.
