Timmy bursts in the door and finds his mom in the kitchen, and he yells, ""Mom! I just saw daddy and Aunt Karen drive off into the woods together!""

Timmy's mom asks, ""And then what happened, sweetie?""

""Well, Aunt Karen started kissing dad on the mouth. And then daddy helped Aunt Karen take her shirt off, and she helped him get out of his pants. And then...""

Timmy's mom interrupts, ""Hold on sweetie. Why don't you save the rest of the story for when daddy gets home for dinner, I'd like to see his reaction to your story.""


So Timmy's dad comes home for dinner, they're all sitting around the table when the mom goes, ""So Timmy, why don't you tell us about what you saw today?""

""Well, I saw daddy and Aunt Karen in the woods. And Aunt Karen was kissing daddy. Then daddy took her shirt off, and Aunt Karen helped dad take his pants off. And then they kissed some more and did that thing that mommy and Uncle Gary always used to do when daddy was out of town for work.""

""Dear Ronald J. Kse,

This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.

Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse, After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse

One day the gods look down upon them with pity and decide to grant them one hour of mortal life. The statues, overwhelmed with joy, rush across the square and into each others arms and immediately run off into a bush to fulfill their greatest desires.

After about half an hour of rustling around in the bushes they emerge, panting and sweaty.

""Wow"", says one of the statues, ""that was amazing"",

""A dream come true"", says the other,""but we've got half an hour left, what should we do now?""

""I know"", the first responds,""this time I'll hold the pigeon down while you shit on it.""

post,6axwxz,2qh72,jokes,false,1494683401,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6axwxz/the_girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. 

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" 

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. 

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good."" 

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" 

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" 

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. 

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",The Girlfriend joke.,2925

Joseph had gotten a big glas shard in his eye, making him completely blind on that eye. He had to walk around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple months. Then he suddenly disapeared one night, along with my girlfriend.


Apparently they had bonded during the time after his injuries and ran away together without even leaving a note behind for me. I tried to track them down but I never found them.

Yesterday, I had a problem, so I called Georgie, the 11 year old next door, whose bedroom looks like Mission Control, and asked him to come over.

Georgie clicked a couple of buttons and solved the problem.

As he was walking away, I called after him, 'So, what was wrong?

He replied, 'It was an ID ten T error.' 

I didn't want to appear stupid, but nonetheless inquired, 'An, ID ten T error? What's that? In case I need to fix it again.'

Georgie grinned, 'Haven't you ever heard of an ID ten T error before?' 

'No,' I replied. 

'Write it down,' he said, 'and I think you'll figure it out.' 

*So I wrote down* :

And desperate for a fcuk,
So off she went into the woods
To try and get some luck.

She’d almost given up looking
When she saw some chimney smoke,
Then she stumbled on the cottage
And went on in for a poke.

Her clothes came off in seconds
And she’d just removed her pants,
When seven dwarves came marching in
With a merry song and dance.

Snow White just stood there speechless
And thought she was in heaven,
Originally after one good shag
But now she could have seven.

Straight away she took command
“My fanny needs a lick!”
And when one dwarf moved forward,
She said “You’d better drop you prick”

So down he went onto all fours,
and said “I ain’t licking that”,
“Not there, that is my arse-hole
You DOPEY little brat!”

The next dwarf started blushing,
“Do we have to do it here?”
Snow White said “Don’t be BASHFUL
Unless you’re a f*cking queer”

So reluctantly he whipped it out,
To prove he was no fool.
And Snow White gave a big “Heigh-Ho”
As she rode upon his tool.

Now one dwarf wasn’t smiling
Cos he hadn’t had a sniff,
And due to his impatience
He couldn’t raise a stiff.

“Relax” you GRUMPY bastard”,
So he did as he was told,
And as soon as he was hard enough,
He shot his f*ckin load.

The next dwarf got a blow-job,
And she took him deep quite easy,
But she just avoided brain-damage,
When he sneezed, she called him SNEEZY.

With three dwarves left she turned and said,
“You’re next, I want your knob!”
But not sooner had he entered her,
And he was sleeping on the job.

“Wake up you SLEEPY bastard”
She wanted more from him,
And he woke with such excitement,
That he filled her hairy quim.

The next dwarf rammed his up her,
And shagged her fanny raw,
A dazed Snow White them whimpered
“That should be against the law.”

He made poor Snow White tremble,
He was so big and thick.
“No wonder you’re so HAPPY,
With that fcuking great big prick”

With one dwarf still remaining,
But feeling rather sore,
She said, “You’ll have to use your tongue,
My twat can’t take no more!”

And so he put his tongue to work,
Where others had placed their cocks,
And ‘cos he made Snow White feel better,
She named the last dwarf “DOC”.

Now Snow White couldn’t do much,
With all that spadge inside her quim,
So she grabbed a cup, and squatted,
And filled it to the brim.

So there’s the truth about the dwarves,
And how they got their names,
By satisfying Miss Snow White,
And joining in her games.

There’s one more thing you need to know,
And that’s – What happened to that cup,
Well think of what you’re drinking,
Next time you order 7-Up!

post,6aw8me,2qh72,jokes,false,1494652506,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6aw8me/charlies_secret_love/,self.jokes,,"Charlie and Angela had been together 5 years now. Charlie thought it was time to take their relationship to the next level and get married. They were engaged later that day.

Although most of the family didn't approve of Angela of being his wife, Charlie decided to secretly wed her anyway and so he did.

Years passed without the family ever knowing that Angela was ever his wife. She'd always be hiding in his room when family was over and he always kept himself from talking about her ever since he lied about them breaking up years ago.

Other than keeping it a secret, the marriage was perfect in Charlie's eyes. Charlie loved Angela the moment they made love for the first time. He could not believe his family did not approve of Angela. He always considered her flawless and expected his family didn't like her because of her Russian roots, but they almost felt insulted to be called racist. They'd always mock her in a Russian accent for goodness sake right in front of her. 

At a certain point, the family started to expect that Charlie was gay because of his public status of being single for almost 10 years now. This bothered Charlie. Not because he hated homosexuals but because it annoyed him of how much he was attracted to Angela.

So, he told Angela this, who comforted him and wasn't angry at all. 

Soon the idea of pretending to be somebody's girlfriend came up. Angela didn't object to this idea and so Charlie would choose one of his good female friends to help him out.

He eventually contacted his close friend Julia if she would help him out. She agreed. They set up times where she'd meet the family and fake dates. The family loved Julia. Over time, Charlie and Julia fell in love. 

Somehow, this relationship was different yet somehow better, but he couldn't just divorce Angela. How could he? She did nothing wrong. After all this time, she remained completely loyal. It was the perfect marriage after all but somehow it just wasn't enough for him.

The more dates he had with Julia the more he saw that he had to do something. He did still love Angela but not as much as he loved Julia. He felt like he had betrayed both of these women, especially when he'd just have loveless sex with Angela when Julia was gone. It was as if Angela was just his own personal whore.

Soon, the thought of starting a family with Julia that he could never have with Angela started to grow along with the guilt.

So, two years and one month after his love affair was when he'd confess.

It was a dreadful Tuesday for Charlie. Julia was coming over and Angela sat on the couch. He told both of them that there was something both of them had to hear. Angela sat quietly as Charlie paced his living room waiting for Julia to come. Angela didn't speak and Charlie felt her eyes pierce his soul. He expected she knew already yet didn't want to say anything until Julia came.

Soon, Charlie welcomed Julia into the apartment and said to sit down in the living room with Angela.

Once Julia saw Angela, a look of confusion ran through her face. Speechless, she sat down across from Angela.

Charlie expected an outburst of anger from one or both of them but was met with a deafening and almost uncomfortable silence.

""Julia, this is my wife, Angela,""

Julia just stared with a confused and uncomfortable look on her face as she looked at Angela then at her boyfriend, then back at Angela.

Then, she said, ""Your wife?""

""I swear I didn't mean to cheat on either of you. I'm sorry. I'm such an awful boyfriend and husband. I don't deserve either of you,"" he said.

That's when Julia started laughing.

""What?"" Charlie said.

Julia couldn't stop laughing and wheezed as both Angela and Charlie watched her quietly. 

""This isn't funny,"" Charlie said, almost angrily.

Julia eventually gathered herself together and looked at her boyfriend who she wasn't plan on leaving anytime soon. 

""You're right, but you can keep your wife, love.""

And all three lived happily together: Charlie, his girlfriend, and his Russian wife, Angela, his sex doll.

He doesn’t have enough money to hire a PI, so he goes to a pet shop. 
There he asks the clerk if he has a parrot for sale. 
The clerk shows him the last parrot he has: “This is the last parrot I have for sale. He doesn’t have any legs, but he is very smart.” 
The man asks, “If he doesn’t have any legs, how does he stay on the perch?” 
“He holds on with his dick.” the clerk answered. 
The man asks ” How much?” 
“Since he doesn’t have any legs, I’ll sell him to you for fifty bucks.”

The suspicious man purchases the talking bird and takes him home. 
He sets up the cage in his bedroom where he can see everything; he then instructs the parrot to watch what ever goes on in the room and inform him when he gets home from work.

So the next morning he leaves for work and his wife stays home, as usual. 
When the man gets home from work, as his wife is cooking supper, he asks the parrot to tell him what went on during the day. 
The parrot begins, “At eight o’clock this morning the mailman came….”
Interrupting the man asks, “Yeah and what happened?” 
“he came in the house…” 
Furiously, the man asked “And then” 
“…and then he came into the bedroom…” 
Astounded the man impatiently asks, “What happened next?”
“He began to take off his clothes and she hers…” “What happened after that!”

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",one of my favourite jokes.,8

Mick replied, 'Don't worry - just follow me.'

He went into the pub where he immediately ordered two pints of Guinness and two glasses of Jamieson Whiskey.

Paddy said 'Now you've lost it. Do you know how much trouble we will be in? We haven't got any money!!'

Mick replied, with a smile. 'Don't worry, I have a plan, Cheers!'

They downed their Drinks. Mick said, 'OK, I'll stick the sausage through my zipper and you go on your knees and put it in your mouth.'

The barman noticed them, went berserk, and threw them out.

They continued this, pub after pub, getting more and more drunk, all for free.

At the tenth pub Paddy said 'Mick - I don't think I can do any more of this. I'm drunk and me knees are killin' me!'

""Gentlemen,"" the Devil started, ""Due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St. Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell.""

The philosopher then stepped up, ""OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings."" With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the philsopher disappeared.

The mathematician then asked, ""Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!"" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too.

The idiot then stepped forward and said, ""Bring me a chair!"" The Devil brought forward a chair.

""Drill 7 holes on the seat."" The Devil did just that.

The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, ""Which hole did my fart come out from?""

The Devil inspected the seat and said, ""Hmm, the third hole from the right.""

""Wrong,"" said the idiot, ""It came from my asshole.""

And so the idiot went to heaven.

""Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs  forever.""

""156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage to do that!""

post,6aq6or,2qh72,jokes,false,1494579606,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6aq6or/the_russian_kings_advisor/,self.jokes,,"A long, long time ago, the King and Queen of Russia were at court looking for a new advisor. The wise, scholarly and arrogant came and told the King of tax systems, political intrigue 
and the the surrounding kingdoms who could be invaded and pillaged. The King yawned through hours of sitting, dismissing one after the other until the throne room was empty, bar 
the guards and herald who were hosting the would-be advisors. 
The King turned to his wife and said ""These men are all the same, my love. They think they know what they do not, they do not tell me what I've done wrong, how can my kingdom
expand if we continue down the same path for perpituity?""
The queen turned to her husband 
""We could summon my Cousin Rudolph, dear"" 
""Rudolph?"" exclaimed the king ""That half-wit fool would better serve as a court jester""
""Rudolph knows politics, dear"" replied the Queen
After a short while of bickering, out of love for his Queen the King summoned Rudolph to court. 
He arrived, dressed in a ragged leather travelling coat, linens spattered in mud and a large pair of fishing waders that came high to his thighs.
The king saw this and chuckled to himself, calling out across the throne room to the queen's cousin ""Rudolph, you came many miles in winter, why are you not dressed in Furs?""
Rudolph smiled and replied slowly ""Definitely muddy. Can't wash furs in ice""

The guards laughed, the herald smiled, but the king sat with a blank face, taken aback by the logical answer. 
And so Rudolph was named as the Kings advisor. The first order of business was the kingdoms tax system. Corruption and inefficiencies meant the crown was only recieving a fraction
of what it was due from the outer settlements. The king explained it all to Rudolph, who sat quietly and nodded, then he said ""We have been trying and executing the corrupt officials, who 
are just replaced with another"" 
""Definitely reward them. Don't steal from generous king"" said Rudolph, slowly.

""Reward the scoundrels that stole from me? You jest"" exclaimed the King, but the Queen simply smiled and said softly ""Rudolph knows people, dear""
So on the advice of Rudolph, the officials of towns outside the capital were given lovely houses and a generous wage for their service to the crown, and that year the rents and tarriffs
were recieved in full and on time. 

Many years went by and the Kingdom was fine, but one day the King called on Rudolph, who appeared in the throne room with a pregnant goat.
The king looked at him, smiled to himself and asked ""Why have you brought this into my throne room?""
""Definitely pregnant."" Said Rudolph, slowly. ""Milk is expensive"" 
And the King nodded and told him of his thoughts about trading with their neigbors. The Chinese silk for the Russian furs, the Polish grain for Russian Lumber.

""China"" Rudolph said slowly ""Definitely Saltpeter"" 
to which the king stood astounded ""Fertaliser? We need that for our crops!""
but the queen simply smiled and turned to her husband; ""Rudolph knows China, dear""
""Definitely use it to make thunder and smoke"" said Rudolph, throwing his hands in the air ""Definitely Bang. Saltpeter for china""
""And what of our other neighbors?"" so the King and Rudolph spoke to one another for a great many hours about what to trade and whom to trade with, making plans and sending 
emmissaries near and far, and that year the towns and villages on the borders were bustling with trade and caravans back and forth between nations. 

Many more years went by and the Kingdom was flourishing, trade and tax had made them wealthy and powerful, much to the dismay of some of their rivals. News reached the 
King of a great army coming across the border from Mongolia. The king called his Generals and Rudolph to the throne room. 
Seasoned warriors in fine armor and lords in fine silks and furs bickered and argued about troop formations and conscriptions, while Rudolph stood quietly in a Red-fox fur scarf and 
a robe.
""Your Grace, we must send cavalry to harrass their supply lines while our army entrenches their pass through the mountains"" Said one
""We need our Cavalry to defend the farmlands, bring all the men able to hold a weapon from every village in the land and we will overwhelm them"" 
This went on and on until the King finally lost his patience and ordered silence. ""Rudolph, how should we deal with this?""

Rudolph stood in his robe and red scarf, thinking for a moment and finally spoke ""Definitely caltrops. Make all roads spikey""
The generals hearing the half-wit speak started laughing, until the Queen hushed them and said to her husband ""Rudolph knows Warfare, dear"" 

""Mongolia. Definitely Horses"" Said Rudolph slowly ""Definitely not good army without horses""
And the king ordered every blacksmith and apprentice to work day and night, laying a wide field of caltrops between the mountains.

Two weeks passed, and the Russian Army was assembled ready to face the invaders. Their journey through the mountains had injured and crippled the vast majority of the horses,
many of which had to be eaten. Though outnumbered, the Russians delivered a swift and decisive blow with their cavalry and superior armored warriors. 

In a great feast of celebration, the Generals and Lords thanked Rudolph for his strategic victory. In honor of this Victory he was dubbed ""Sir Rudolph"",  though most of the land 
knew him as ""Rudolph the Red"" for his scarf. As the night grew late and a chill picked up in the air, the moon beamed down on their exhalted assembly, Sir Rudolph came to the King
and said ""Definitely Finished. Too wet to continue feast"" 
""Too wet?"" replied the king ""There's not a cloud in the sky""
But the queen had already risen, turning to her husband 
""Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear""",The Russian King's Advisor,14

""Well,"" says the pirate, ""I lost my leg in a shark attack when I'd fallen overboard drunk""

""That's terrible"" says the bartender. ""What about your hand?""

""That there I lost in a duel"" replied the pirate 

""And your eye?"" implored the bartender

""I was on watch the night after the duel and a bird shit in my eye"" said the pirate.

""Wait, you lost your eye from bird shit?"" the bartender asks.

So the pirate says ""Well, I'd only had the hook for a day""

post,6appq1,2qh72,jokes,false,1494570878,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6appq1/long_a_guy_wanted_to_lose_weight/,self.jokes,,"There's a guy.  We'll call him Bob.  Bob is a fat slob, but one day decides that he's going to turn things around and start getting in shape.  So he sees an ad for a new workout program, and calls the number.  The operator agrees to start him off with a one-month trial of their lowest level program, and tells Bob to be ready to go running first thing in the morning, and someone will be out to his house.

So first thing in the morning, hes all dressed and ready, and hears a knock on the door.  He opens the door and sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.  Just eye-poppingly gorgeous.  She's wearing a T-shirt that reads ""If you catch me, you can have me"".  And without a word, she takes off running.

Well Bob takes off after her.  He chases her several blocks before he's just to tired to continue and collapses on the pavement.  After a bit to catch his breath, he gets up and realizes she's long gone, and he doesn't even know which way she went, so he just has to go home.

The next day, there's another knock on his door.  Same girl, same T-shirt, same drill as before.  He still doesn't catch her, but he gets a few blocks farther before he's forced to stop.  This process is repeated for the whole month, and while Bob never manages to catch up to her, he does lose a lot of weight trying.

After the last session, he gets a phone call from the program, asking how his trial month went, and if he'd like to try the next-level program.  It's a more strenuous program, not for the faint of heart, but if Bob wants to give it a go, they'll let him try it.  Bob, decides to give it a shot.

Next morning, there's a knock on the door.  It's a new girl with the same T-shirt, so beautiful that she makes the previous one look like a snaggle-toothed hag by comparison.  The sort of woman Bob didn't even think could really exists.  She flashes him a quick smile that makes his heart melt and takes off running even faster than the first girl.  Bob chases after her even harder and more determined than before, and manages to keep up with her for several miles before falling out.  Like before, this continues on for the whole month, Bob getting more in shape and managing to run further and faster each time.

The last day of the month comes by, and Bob is ready and waiting.  By this time, he's a lean, mean running machine.  He gets up before dawn to warm up and stretch, eat a good breakfast, and make sure he's well hydrated.  So when that knock on the door comes, it's off to the races.

The girl takes off at a dead sprint, but Bob follows right on her heels.  She runs up and down every street in town, mile after mile, juking and weaving and doing everything she can to lose Bob, but Bob is in shape now and keeps right on her heels.  All day he chases her around town, and then, after running a virtual marathon around town, he finally catches her, and he has her.

So Bob is feeling pretty good about himself now.  He's gone from a fat slob that no woman would give the time of day to to a stud that's banging supermodels.  But he wonders if this is really as far as he can go.  So he calls up the number and asks if there's any other programs.  The salesman hesitates before answering, then tells him that yes, they do have one more level of program, but it's only for the *most* dedicated clients and he doesn't really think it's suitable for Bob.  But Bob is pretty self-confident now, so he insists.  After a while, he eventually gets the salesman to relent sign him up for the top level program.

Morning comes, and Bob hears a knock on the door.  Given that he'd thought the first girl was practically a perfect 10, and the second one was even better, he's anxious to see what the best one looks like.  He opens the door, and sees a gigantic brute of a man, at least seven feet tall and sporting what looks like 300 pounds of pure muscle.  The brute has a cruel smirk on his face that makes Bob's blood freeze in is veins, and is staring directly at Bob the way a lion stares at a wounded zebra.

Bob looks at the man's T-shirt, which reads ""If I catch you, I get to keep you"".",[Long] A guy wanted to lose weight,3

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery.

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most beautiful, most hair-raising noise ever.

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again! Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen.

""What was that sound?"" he asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?""

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk.""

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is."" he begged.

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk.

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl. ""Please tell me what made that sound!""

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said.

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" 

The head monk just shook his head. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" 

""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said.

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?"" 

The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.""

The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky.""

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded.

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.""

The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what kind of being could make that wonderful, beautiful sound. So he left on his journey. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later. The head monk heard his answer and nodded.

""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought. He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me.""

He led the man through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it. And finally.. Finally! Finally he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise.

Take your clothes off, sit on the bench, and attach this bell to the end of your penis. When the naked woman comes into the room, any man whose bell rings will have failed the test. He won't be allowed to join our order, and must leave at once, for he will be sorely troubled with sexual thoughts while he is in our midst.""

Then the most beautiful young blonde with big tits waltzes into the room and starts walking slowly down the line, teasing the men as she goes. Not a sound. Not a single erection, not a single bell rings. Until she gets to the end of the line and pushes her butt into Dave's face.

Well, it's all too much for him - his cock shoots up, the bell rings furiously and goes flying off across the room with the force of his erection.

""I'm sorry,"" he mumbles, confused and embarrassed, ""I'll just pick it up and leave.""

There was a popular German gameshow where contestants would take part in various activities for a grand prize of 1 million euro. 


After a very successful run it was time for the final episode and there were only two contestants left: an old Jewish rabbi and a redneck from America. 


The host of the gameshow brought them both up to the stage and revealed to them their final task was to think up a poem, and the person with the best poem as judged by the crowd would get the grand prize of 1 million euro. The poem could be about anything, but as to make sure it wasn't too easy, the only requirement placed upon the contestants was that the final word in the poem had to be **""Timbuktu""**.

The rabbi was first and he walked up to the mic, and after a deep breath, said:
&gt;I've been a rabbi all my life,
&gt;
had no children, had no wife.
&gt; 
I read the bible through and through,
&gt; 
On my way to Timbuktu.

The German crowd cheered and clapped and thought to themselves, ""What a fine poem, surely this eloquent rabbi will be the winner.""

After the crowd quieted down it was the redneck's turn. The redneck slowly walked up to the microphone. 

A moment passed, silence. And then he said
&gt;Tim and I to Bangkok went,

&gt;found three ladies cheap to rent. 

&gt;For they were three and we were two,

&gt;I booked one, and Tim booked two.

The first nun steps up and says no, but I've seen one in a book. 
St. Peter says hold on one moment while I verify your answer... 
He returns and says You are correct on Dec. 17, 1964, you saw a man's private in the worldbook encyclopedia, so go wash your face in the holy water and enter the gates of heaven! 


The second nun steps up and the same question is asked to her.... 
she replies I once touched one with my finger. 
St. peter goes away for a moment and comes back and states that she has not lied, and that in fact that on Sept. 11, 2001 she had a momentary  weakness and did indeed touch a man's private with one finger.  
He tells her to go and wash her hand in the holy water and enter into the gates of heaven! 


Now the third and fourth nuns start yelling at each other and soon end up rolling around in a dog eat dog fight...

The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for.
He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.'
He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.

Joe tried the shirt and it fit perfectly.
Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?'

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..'

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36.

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..'

The middle aged couple is interviewed and the pastor says: ""Well? How'd it go?"" And the middle aged husband says: ""We were able to abstain. It was very difficult, and I had to sleep on the couch a couple nights, but we did it."" The pastor says: ""Good job, you may now join our church"". 
The young couple is interviewed finally and the pastor says: ""Tell me, were you able to abstain?"" And the young husband says: ""Well Reverend, we tried. We held out for a couple weeks but one day she was bending over to grab a box of cereal off a low shelf and the urge came over me and we got undressed and did it right then and there."" The pastor sadly replies: ""I'm sorry son, you can't join our church.""
And the young husband, shamefaced, mutters: ""Yeah, and they're not gonna let us back into Walmart for a while either.""",There are three couples trying to join a Baptist church,23

One Christmas season, they decided to create a new, exclusive and especially high-quality crate to sell off at an auction. Many came to see and try to obtain the crate, nicknamed the 'Merry Kurg Crate'. Eventually, an employee from Nintendo bought it at $100,000.

However,  over the next few months, somehow, Kurg Industries got sold to Nintendo after a near-bankruptcy. By next Christmas Season, people were attempting to recreate the Merry Kurg Crate but to no avail, since its formula was well-hidden. 

Nintendo, seeking to please the crowds, decided to release the crate as a purchasable DLC item for an upcoming game. Their website later said:

**WII WILL MAKE A MERRY KURG CRATE AGAIN.**",Kurg Industries' Story,4

An angel descends and tells them ""Actually, there's been a mistake. It wasn't your time to die. We will let you come back to life, but you must promise to renounce your vices.""

To the Irishman, the angel said, ""Your vice is drinking too much. You can come back to life as long as you stop drinking. We will tempt and test you to make sure you abstain."" He agrees. 

To the Greek, the angel said, ""You engage in perverted sexual practices. You can come back to life only if you remain celibate. We will test you to make sure you comply."" He agrees. 

To the Jew, the angel said, ""Your vice is greed. You can come back to life only if you reform your avaricious ways. But you will be tested."" He agrees.

As the three resurrected men are walking down the street, they pass a bar. The Irishman resists. They pass a second bar. He resists again. They pass a third bar, and the Irishman can't resist any longer - he runs toward the bar and instantly disappears in a puff of smoke. 

Frightened, the Greek and the Jew continue walking. The Jew spots a penny on the ground, and is able to resist picking it up. Then it turns into a quarter. Still he resists. Then it turns into a dollar. He wavers, but still resists. 

It turns into a five. Nope.

It turns into a ten. Nope.

It turns into a $20 bill. 

He bends over to pick it up, and both him and the Greek disappear.","A Greek, A Jew and an Irishman are killed by a bus",6
