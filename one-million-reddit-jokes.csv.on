God walks into His room, and takes His seat at the throne. He then beckons to the Dominican:

*Son of St. Dominic, come thee hither.*

The Dominican walks towards the throne of God, and kneels before Him. God then asks him:

To which the Dominican replies, ""I believe in thee, Father God almighty, creator of heaven and of earth, and of all things visible and invisible."" God says, *""Thou hast done well. Thou mayest proceed into heaven.""* The Dominican profusely thanks Him and leaves politely, escorted by the strongest and tallest angels he's ever seen.

He then beckons to the Franciscan, raising his finger that shone brighter than the sun itself:

An 86 year-old man is out fishing. He was sitting in his boat when he heard a voice say, ""Pick me up!""

He looked around and did not see any one. He thought he was dreaming until he heard the voice again.

""Pick me up."" The old man looked in the water and there, floating on a lilly pad was a frog.

The man said, ""Are you talking to me?""

The frog replied, ""Yes, I'm talking to you. Pick me up. Then, kiss me and I'll turn into the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. I'll make sure that all your friends are envious and jealous because you will have me as your bride.""

The man looked at the frog for a minute in confusion, reached over, picked it up carefully, and placed it in his front pocket.

The frog screamed, ""What, are you nuts? Didn't you hear what I said?? I said kiss me and I will be your beautiful bride!""

He opened his pocket, looked at the frog and said, ""Nah, at my age I'd rather have a talking frog.""",With age comes wisdom,99

In the forest by the pond, there is a magic purple toad. If you can get the toad to say 'No' to you, your penis will shrink by three inches.""

The man followed the witch's advice, and went into the forest. Sure enough, by the lakeside was a large purple toad. The man thought for a moment, then walked up to the toad and said, ""Hey magic toad, do you want to have sex with me?""

The toad replied with a disgusted face, ""What? No!""

As promised, the man's penis shrunk to 12 inches! But it was still too big for him to be comfortable with, so he asked again, ""Magic toad, please won't you have sex with me?""

The toad once again made a face and croaked, ""Ew, no!"" and the man's penis shrunk to 9 inches. Still, he thought that might be too big.

""6 inches should be fine,"" he decided, so he went to the toad once more and said, ""Magic toad, I need you to have sex with me!"" to which the magic toad replied, ""How many times do I have to tell you?! No! No! A thousand times no!""",Once there was a man with a 15 inch penis.,21232

post,66aj7k,2qh72,jokes,false,1492612166,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/66aj7k/walt_disney/,self.jokes,,"Just after WWII, Walt Disney was at a loss for new subjects for his movies and decided to take his family on a tour of the world to refresh his creative spirit. Walt, ever the optimist, was undaunted and vowed to seek out an idea for a new film, even if he had to stray from his normal family-friendly genres. Good fortune struck him when in the second week of his tour of India, he was offered a chance to meet and chat with the great Mahatma Ghandi himself. Curiously, it turns out Ghandi was a big fan of Mickey Mouse, heard its creator was visiting nearby, and sought Walt out for a meeting. Word reached Walt from the British embassy and he jumped at the chance. He and his wife hastily arranged for an embassy worker to mind the children while they went to seek out the great man.

Ghandi was a very humble and spiritual man, so when Walt entered Ghandi's home, he found him sitting on the floor, dressed in a simple white robe, spinning yarn. Ghandi's hands were rough and callused from years of physical labor. Also, Walt noticed that Ghandi was very thin and fragile from his fasting and hunger strikes to protest British subjugation. A short time into their conversation in the cramped abode, Walt noticed that Ghandi had the pungent bad breath of a devout vegetarian. Walt left after a wonderful, lengthy conversation thinking this fascinating man would be a great subject for a feature film.

When Walt and his wife got back to the British embassy to collect their children, Walt could hardly contain his excitement as he told his children of his encounter. The children were less interested in this and more excited in telling the their father about the fun they'd been having with their British caretaker. Walt kept going on though, until the children's sitter - a very prim and proper British woman who had no use for Ghandi or Indian independence - interrupted him. ""You mean you want to make a movie about that super-callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis?"" 


*The ""pun""chline is relatively pervasive, but the credit for the idea for the story goes out to an unknown YouTube commenter who laid out a similar framework some time ago*",Walt Disney,29

The auditor said, “Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.”
“I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Grandpa. “How about a demonstration?”
The auditor thinks for a moment and said, “Okay. Go ahead.”
Grandpa says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.”
The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.”
Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.
Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.”
Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.
The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.
“Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”
The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.
Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor’s desk.
The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.
“Are you okay?” the auditor asks.
“Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it!”",Since it's tax time and all...,242

'What's that?' I asked. 'It's a mother and daughter threesome,' she said. I said, 'No,' - excitedly.
We drank a bit more, then she says that tonight was 'my lucky night'. I went back to her place.
She put on the hall light and shouted upstairs: '
Mum, you still awake?'",I ended up with an older woman at a club last night,1399

Well, one day Boudreaux had enough and decided to get back at Thibodeaux. After being out for an hour or so, Boudreaux circled back to find Thibodeaux passed out sitting on a hollowed out tree stump, gun on his lap and pants around his ankles.

""Mais dis is too good!"" said Boudreaux as he pulled a rabbit from his bag. ""Dat bastard ain't gon' know what hit him.""

So Boudreaux gutted the rabbit, placed the entrails under ol' Thibodeaux's bare ass, and went to wait in the truck.

A couple hours later, Boudreaux sees Thibodeaux come running out of the woods as fast as an old man can, hands waving wildy and shouting.

""Boudreaux! Mon frere, you ain't never gon' believe what happened! Mon dieu, it's a miracle!""

Boudreaux, a little confused and barely holding back a smile, replied ""Lemme guess, you fell asleep again?""

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”",My first time buying a condom.,23

Five minutes into the woods, he spots a huge grizzly, takes aim and fires… and when the smoke clears, bear is gone. As he's puzzling over this, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and there, towering over him, is the bear.

""Well, you took your best shot and missed, so now I'm going to eat you!""

The man begs and pleads not to be killed, and the bear thinks about it and says, ""I suppose I COULD let you live… if you give me a blow job.""

So the man does the horrible deed and goes back to the gun shop the following day, walking out with an AK-47. He goes back to the woods, sees the same bear, takes aim and empties the whole clip. The smoke clears, and the bear is gone again. Then there's a tap on the shoulder…

""Okay, twice is too much. You missed again, so I'm REALLY going to eat you now.""

Once again, the man begs and pleads and, after some thought, the bear relinquishes - except that this time the man has to let the bear have sex with him.

Back to the shop and this time he walks out with the biggest thing they've got - an ex-Soviet Army rocket launcher. He returns to the forest, spots the bear, fires up the scope and fires. There's a huge explosion and, when the smoke clears, no bear - just a smoking crater. Grinning with satisfaction, he starts to lower the weapon…

…and then there's a tap on his shoulder.

With one hand on his hip, the bear cocks his head and says, ""You're not really here for the hunting, are you?""

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same person's car breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, and even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went on until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery.,181

All the while his identity had been fraying for years, but latest incident had left him in a deep hole that was only getting deeper. He rigged a hose to the tailpipe of his proud Mercedes-Benz, putting it through the front driver's side window of his car and started it. He sat there waiting for the inevitable collapse into the dark deep abyss of nothingness he was soon to face. His wife had been told not to bother him while he worked on his car which was an odd request for her to receive, as he always felt better showing off his great mechanical skill to the love of his life. She decided to check on him as she noticed he had been somber for weeks. She walked into the garage and was horrified to find John nodding in and out of consciousness. She ripped the hose out of the window and cried as she carried him into the house and before calling 911 she said: ""Sorry for talking you into getting pegged intimately. By the way you look like you'll be okay but seem quite exhausted"" He replied: ""Everything involving tailpipes leaves you exhausted.""",John's car,3
