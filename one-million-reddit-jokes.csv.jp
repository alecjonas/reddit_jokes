The leader asks her, ""What is 15 plus 15?""

After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 10,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 10,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 10,000 blondes begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not she is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

Throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 10,000 blondes jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

One day, he decided that he was getting too old and hadn’t done anything worthwhile with ',\&lt;:} his life. So, he told his boss he was quitting and left to become a standup comedian. 

Bob started practicing and practicing in all of his spare time while he looked for a job opening. Finally, he landed a gig at a local bar for the night. For his first time on the job, he did alright. He cracked a few jokes, got a few laughs from the people that were still somewhat sober, and made a little bit of cash to supplement what he had saved up from his marketing job. 

Bob went on to do this for a few months, and he gradually became more and more successful as his name spread among the comedic world. He prided himself on his routine about his former job as a marketing expert. Well, wouldn’t you know it, his former boss caught wind of his rising success, and asked him to feature in an advertisement for the telephone company. Bob thought, what the heck, he could use some quick cash, so he agreed. {:\&gt;,'

Fast forward a few more months, and Bob is really rising to stardom. Finally, he even gets invited to a premier late\-night show session for up\-and\-coming comedians. Bob is incredibly excited and is confident he will knock this one out of the park. 

Well, for whatever strange reason, when Bob gets to the show he’s not feeling so great. His delivery is off, the audience isn’t appreciating his jokes, and he generally struggles on stage. The host sees that Bob is having a difficult time, and calls for a commercial break. 

{:\&gt;,'

Bob is sitting backstage in a panic, trying to decide how to salvage his routine. His newfound career will be ruined else wise! Well, before long time elapses and the commercial break is drawing to a close. The host calls him back to the stage, and Bob steps out in confusion. ,'\&lt;:} The audience is in uncontrollable fits of laughter, and when it finally subsides they give him a standing ovation. 

Bob looks toward the host for guidance. 

The host, who is also barely controlling his laughter, says to the comedian, well I can definitely see why they say you are one of the best newcomers to the job! 

The comedian is still confused. What happened that was so funny? I was backstage, it couldn’t have been me! 

The host, wiping away tears of mirth, says, It was the commercial break. Remember that advertisement you did for your former employer? The one about how telephone marketing workers are like poached panda bears so everyone should buy their products to save the panda bears? 

Well, it turns out, Bob, that the real joke was in the comm ads. ",Bob the marketing expert quits to become a comedian. [OC] [Long],0

post,8g57za,2qh72,jokes,false,1525142674,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8g57za/desert_deployment_story_oc_long/,self.jokes,,"When I was deployed to middle east there were these Asian or Arabic guys who made food and cleaned out the port-a-johns and things like that.  (I can’t tell what ethnicity they were because I’m from the Midwest and I don’t meet anyone who isn’t white or Latin-American or Vietnamese.)

Anyway one of them is a huge douche named Shey’Di.  He carries heavy tools and eats a lot and he got a big frame so he almost looks like he works out.  I call him buff Shey’Di.  Screw that guy.

One day a new guy shows up cleaning out the toilets, and he was the most emaciated-looking guy I’ve ever seen.  He looked like a holocaust survivor who went on a 7-day cleanse or something.  Very thin and gaunt guy.  I called him out on it too every time I saw him.  

After a few weeks he says, “please stop call me by refer to my body.  It is very very rude!  My name is Shey’Di!”

“Wow!” I exclaim, “We got a jerk of a big guy called Shey’Di who already works here, little Shey’Di is you!”

This pissed him off and he wouldn’t talk to me anymore.

A few days later I was passing by the toilets 

I heard someone crying out “Help me!  Someone please help!”

I like to think of myself as that-great-of-a-guy (I’m not but), so I went over to investigate.  Mind you I’m tired and it’s really hot so I just want to go in the shade, but I go over to the source of the worst stench on God’s kingdom – a used port-a-john baking in direct sun at 130 degrees.  I consider myself quite the hero for even going over there.

“What’s wrong?” I asked as I hurry over.

“It’s me Shey’Di, I am trapped in this shit-hole!”

“Huh?” Doesn’t make sense to me.

“The door jam!  Do not open!”

I figure I can pry the door open with my knife, but because I am not wanting to help out buff Shey’Di, I needed some clarification: 

“Which Shey’Di are you?”

To this question, he replied, “I’m the real slim Shey’Di!”

Paddy arrived into London and walked around the streets. As he wandered around, he saw a sign that said ""WC"" on it and an arrow pointing down some stairs. He went down and saw 3 stalls ""WC1 - WC2 -WC3"".


Paddy knocked on the door of WC1 and asked,


""Are you Nelly Dunne in there?"" 


A voice responded, ""Yeah but theres no paper.""


Paddy angrily replied with, ""Well thats no reason for not writing to your mother.""

Since his hobby was body-building; he decided it should be a contest of strength. That way he reasoned; he'd never lose and would still get all the extra customers. So the next night, he stood up in the bar and issued his challenge. He set a lemon up on the bar and shouted out ""I'm willing to pay $500 plus whatever's in the pot to anybody who can squeeze more juice out of this lemon than I can. It costs $2 to play. Any takers?""

A bunch of guys rushed over and tossed in their $2. Then the bar owner picked up the lemon, which was completely dwarfed by his massive hand and crushed it. Lemon juice ran like a river out of his hand. The competitors looked discouraged but all of them tried to get more juice out of it. Alas, their efforts were in vain.

This continued night after night and drew more &amp; more people to the bar. Bigger and stronger guys came in but none of them were able to get so much as a drop of juice from the lemon after the bar owner was done with it.

Then one night a very small, frail-looking man came into the bar. He watched the proceedings and after everyone else in the bar had tried to squeeze more juice from the lemon; he walked up to the bar owner. He said ""Here's my $2; I'd like to try squeezing the lemon.""

The bar owner looked down at the man and laughed at him. ""You think you can beat me, little man? HA!""

The small man just ignored them, took the lemon from bar owner and squeezed it. The flood of juice that came out of the lemon while the small man was squeezing it made the juice the bar owner had extracted look like the tiniest of drops.

Everybody in the bar was stunned into silence. The bar owner looked at the small man with awe and asked how he'd done that?

The man looked up with a smile on his face and said, ""I work for the Canada Revenue Agency"".",In honour of Tax Deadline Day...,21

‘I want the kids’. 80 mph.

‘I want the bank details’. 85 mph.

‘I’ve got everything I need already’, he responds.

‘What’s that?’

His father pondered the situation and finally told his son to wear socks constantly (even to bed) and always wash his feet whenever he got a chance. The son thought about this and went along happy. The same day the young lady approached her mother and told her about her problem. Her morning breath was horrid. Her mother reassured her and told her everyone had bad morning breath. The young woman told her mother that this was not normal morning breath but easily the worst in the world. The mother thinks about this and comes up with this bright idea. She tells her daughter to get up earlier than everyone else and don't say a thing, go make breakfast and then brush her teeth while the others are eating. The young woman thinks and then runs off to get ready for the wedding, happy. The couple is married and they are happy, him with his perpetual socks and her with her morning silences. One morning about 5:30 am the young man wakes up to find one sock missing. He starts rustling around in the bed looking for it, which of course wakes up his wife, who without thinking asks what's wrong. With a look of shock on his face the young man says, ''OH MY GOD! You've swallowed my sock!'' ","A young man and a young woman were soon to be married, but they both had a problem they had never told anyone else about.",2

The first letter writes: ""To my children, know that I am ready to die. I have lived a good and meaningful life and I wish to fade into what comes next elegantly.""

The second letter writes: ""To my friends, I ask you to make sure my life's work is not used in despicable nature, and thank you for being with me all these years.""

The final letter writes: ""To my colleagues, I say to you on my deathbed that there are only two things that are worthwhile in this life: the pursuit of truth and the pursuit of happiness. I implore you to never give up fighting for either.""

As he puts the letters in envelopes, a beautiful nurse walks into the ward and she comes to take the letters. 

""Is that all you wish to write?"" she says

""Yes, I feel as though I'm ready to go to the other side now"" he says

""I have but one last thing to say: Sende Nacktbilder"" 

He then closes his eyes with a smile and fades into the afterlife.

The nurse didn't speak german however, but remembered what he said and wrote it down on a piece of paper

Later a statue of Einstein gets built near to the hospital, with an inscription of his birth and death date and his final words: ""Sende Nacktbilder"".

A few weeks later, a German tourist walks by and looks at the inscription.

The farmer told the two hunters that if they got lost, they should fire three shots into the air and he would come get them. This sounded like a good plan and the hunters went off hunting for deer.

About two hours later the two found themselves with no deer and totally lost.

""Jim,"" Bob said, ""I believe we are lost, you'd better fire three shots into the air.""

""Yeah, I think you're right Bob,"" said Jim. ""We better alert the farmer so he can come get us.""

Dressed in classic gentlemanly fashion he decided to start the tour by visiting the famed Victoria Memorium Hall. Taken aback by the marvellous architecture, he stopped the nearest passerby and asked, ""Who made this beautiful structure, if I may ask?"". The passerby answered, ""Who knows Sir?"" The British man's eyes lit up. He thought, ""I must visit Sir Huenose before I leave this country!"".

His next stop was the Eden Gardens Stadium.  Again, he was stunned by the architectural design of the stadium. In his excitement, he grabbed the nearest person and asked, ""Who made this beautiful structure, if I may ask?"". The person clearly irked by the grabbing irritably said, ""Who knows Sir?"". The British man was taken aback. He thought, ""I simply must meet Sir Huenose before I leave. He seems to be a household name here"".

His last stop of the day took him to the Hoogly Bridge. He was once again amazed by the breathtaking design. Again he beckoned the nearest person and asked, ""Who might have made this structure, if I may ask?"" The man clearly in a hurry said, ""Who knows Sir?"" and left. The British man had no words left to praise the achievements of Sir Huenose.

At sundown, he was slowly walking past the Ganges river while formulating the best way to setup a meet with Sir Huenose. 

Then suddenly he notices several Hindu priests carrying a body on their shoulders while chanting their god's name. Wondering who it might be, he asked the nearest person, ""Who might that be, if I may ask?"". The person being a simple bystander  shrugged and said, ""Who knows Sir?"".

Griefstricken, the British man exclaimed ""Oh what a dreadful day, Sir Huenose is dead!!""

One day The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse was trotting through the forest when he realised how lonely he was. So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse decided to find himself a wife. 
He travelled to the closest town and approached a citizen. 

""Citizen, I demand you tell me who is the most beautiful lady in all the land!""

""I can't just tell you who the most beautiful lady in all the land is!""

""Of course you can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse?""

""Yes, I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Oh, well in that case, it's the princess. She lives in the castle over there!""

So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse trots up to the castle and finds a guard at the door.
""Guard, I demand you let me through!""
""I can't just let you into the castle!""

""Of course you can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""you're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse?""

""Yes! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Oh, well then come on in!""

So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse enters the castle and approaches the King in the throne room.

""My lord, I wish to marry your daughter.""

""You can't just marry my daughter!""

""Of course I can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse?""

""Yes, I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Well then of course! She's just upstairs in her living quarters.""

So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse climbs the stairs to find the princess in her living quarters.

""Princess, I'm here to marry you!""

""You can't just marry me! I'm the princess!""

""But of course I can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!?""

""Yes! The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Oh! Nothing could be more of an honor! But first you should collect me three items. I want:

•The sands of time, from the desert of time.

•Moon rocks, from the moon.

•And the crown jewels, from Buckingham palace.
Can you handle that?""

""Of course I can! I'm  The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse heads to the desert of time. Two weeks travel and he arrives. The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse pulls out a jar and starts collecting the sands of time. And old man appears and says ""You can't just take the sands of time!""

""Of course I can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse?""

""Yes! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Well then by all means, take them!""

So he collects the sands of time and builds himself a giant catapult with which he launches himself to the moon. Upon landing he starts to pick up moon rocks when a Martian jumps out with a ray gun and squeals ""BRREEEGGUUNTOP""

""Of course I can I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse""

""Yes! The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""PAAAAARRRFFYUNGANT!""

So after collecting the rocks, the Martian gives The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse an enormous parachute with which he jumps of the moon with and lands in the middle of Buckingham palace. He spots the crown jewels and goes to take them when a female walks in and says ""You can't just take the crown jewels!""

""Of course I can! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""You're The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse?""

""Yes, The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Oh... Well... You still can't just take them.""

The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse was stumped. He'd never been in this situation before. He started to think about what he could do when he remembered a famous artist who cut his own ear off for his one true love. 

So The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse cuts his ear off and places it in a box and heads back to the castle. 

He arrives at the castle and heads straight for the princess.

""Princess, I have returned!""

""Oh joy! Did you bring me the sands of time?""

""Of course I did! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Fabulous! Did you bring me the moon rocks?""

""Of course I did! I'm The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse!""

""Sensational! Did you bring me the crown jewels?""

The Red and White Knight with the Black and White Horse pulled out the box and said **""No... But look what I have ear!""**

She paused for a second, frowned, and replied. ""No.""

Surprised, Guido reached for her and the rattling resumed. This time she thrashed about wildly and there were screams of passion. The sex finally ended and, again, Guido smiled and asked, ""You finish?""

Again, after a short pause, she returned his smile, cuddled closer to him and softly said, ""No.""

Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman unsatisfied, Guido reached for the woman yet again. Using the last of his strength, he barely managed it, but they ended together screaming, bucking, clawing and ripping the bed sheets.

Exhausted, Guido fell onto his back, gasping. Barely able to turn his head, he looked into her eyes, smiled proudly and asked again, ""You finish?""

You now have to tell me the story of how you died, and if I think it's sad or interesting enough, I'll let you in.""

He walks up to the first man who is a nerdy, bookish sort in a bad business suit and says, ""Tell me your story.""

""Okay,"" says the man. ""I thought I had a wonderful life. I had a beautiful wife and we had a lovely place on the 34th floor of an apartment building. I came home from work early today, and I saw my beautiful wife sleeping naked in bed with another man's clothes on the floor. So of course I started looking for the bastard who slept with my wife.""

""Like I said, I lived in an apartment. There weren't that many places to hide, but I couldn't find him anywhere! Just when I was about to go confront my wife, I see him. The bastard was hiding outside the window, holding onto the windowsill. I go up to him and started stomping on his hands over and over again, but he wouldn't let go. I finally kicked him in the face and he fell. Unfortunately, he landed on a bush and bounced to safety. In my anger, I grabbed my refrigerator and throw it out after him. However, the cord from the refrigerator wrapped around my leg and pulled me to my death.""

St. Peter nods and says, ""You're story is acceptable. Welcome to heaven."" He goes to the second man a brawny working-man type and says, ""What's your story?""

""I'm a window washer,"" says the man. ""I've been a window washer for over 20 years. Well today, I'm washing the windows of the 35th floor of this apartment building when my scaffolding breaks. I thought I was going to die, but I manage to catch myself on the windowsill of the story below. All of a sudden this maniac comes out and starts mashing my fingers. I try my best to hold on, but he kicks me in the face and I fall. Once again, I thought I was going to die, but I land on this hedge and bounce away no worse for the wear. I look up and BOOM. Dead. Last thing I saw was a refrigerator.""

St. Peter holds back a chuckle and lets him into heaven. He goes to the third man, a ridiculously handsome fellow with sandy-blonde hair, and asks, ""What's your story?""

""Alright,"" says the man. ""Picture this. You just got finished banging some dude's wife. He comes home. You hide in the refrigerator.""",Three men arrive in heaven at the same time. St. Peter comes out to greet them.,858

“It really is fantastic!”  The Devil replies, then looks at the man before asking “And do you like drugs?” The man stops and thinks for a moment, and then responds “Well, yeah, I dabbled a little bit when I was alive, I could probably enjoy doing some drugs.”
“Perfect! Wednesday’s we do all the drugs- weed, cocaine, heroin, you name it! You’re already dead, it ain’t gonna kill ya! Do all the drugs you want, 24 hours a day, every Wednesday!” The Devil tells him. 
“Okay, great! Yeah, I could get used to that!” The man says, grinning from ear to ear.

One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter. 


Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. 


""I'd like some raisin bread please"", the man says politely. 


The female clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man standing almost directly beneath her is provided with an excellent view, just as he surmised he would be. Once she descends the ladder he muses that he really should get two loaves as he's having company for dinner. 


As the clerk retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices whats going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. 


With each trip up the ladder the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon each male patron is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down. 


After many trips shes tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try this bread for herself! 


Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd staring up at her. 


Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells at the elderly man, ""Is yours raisin too?"" 


""No,"" says the old man ""....... But its startin' to twitch.""

Dearest Darling, This is a little gift to show my affection for you on our Anniversary. I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when you go out in the evenings. If it had not been for your younger sister, I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears the short ones that are easy to remove. These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me a pair that she had been wearing for three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had the sales girl try them on and she really looked great. I wish I could put them on you for the first time. No doubt other men's hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. 

When you take them off, blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Be sure to keep them on when you clean them or they might shrink. I hope you will like them and wear them for me on Friday night. 

All my love,

His engine's gasket blown.

His car was old and cold and towed.

The man was left alone.

-

'I need to find a place to stay

Until it's fixed,' he spoke -

But as he rose to walk away

Arrived a band of folk.

-

They said: 'You're warmly welcome here

To while away the night!

We're godly monks, and living near -

We walk the path of light.'

-

With thanks, the man inclined his head,

And through the dusky gloom -

He followed where the Abbot led,

Who showed him to a room.

-

'Goodnight and fare thee well to you -

Sleep tight!' the Abbot said.

'And may your dreams be just and true,

Inside your humble bed.'

-

But when he tried to sleep, he found

A noise that started small -

The most surprising, splendid sound

Emerging through the wall.

-

It made him think of sirens song -

The secret chimes of Mars -

The shrouded space where dreams belong -

The voice beyond the stars.

-

It made him think of hearts that yearn -

The rhymes of wings unfurled -

The passing beat of time to turn -

The light beneath the world.

-

It made him think of love and peace -

The silent bliss behind -

The perfect place where problems cease

To vex the waking mind.

-

The morning broke. The man awoke.

'What was it, monks?' he cried.

'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -

'You're not a monk,' they sighed.

-

'But what a sense the sounds evoke!

Oh tell me, friends!' he cried.

'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -

'You're not a monk,' they sighed.

-

'I have to know!' the man explained,

And so, without remorse -

He joined the house, and prayed and trained,

To find the noise's source.

-

He took the Test of Absent Bliss -

The Woes of Anguish Drowned -

He braved the Gulf of Faith's Abyss -

And all to find the sound.

-

He stood before the Secret Sect -

The Path of Rousing Ploys -

He stepped the steps of Last Respect -

And all to find the noise.

-

He crossed the Gate of Constant Grief -

The Voids of Now and Then -

He walked the Road of Lost Belief -

To hear it once again.

-

And when he'd pained and strained and bled,

And most his life had passed -

'You're ready now,' the others said,

'To see the source at last.'

-

They took him where the air was fair,

And where, inside a trunk...

I'd love to tell you what was there.

Alas, you're not a monk.",Credit to /u/Poem_for_your_sprog,14

He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",The Task,5

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.""   

""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal.   
  
Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.   
  
He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.""   
  
He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on the windowsill: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.   
  
As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost."" ",The Three Chinese Tortures.,43
