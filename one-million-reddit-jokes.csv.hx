His son became the new chief. According to the tradition, to prove his worth as the leader, he has to correctly speculate how cold would be the winter this year. With his guidance, people will gather right amount of wood for the whole winter season before it starts. So, in the morning, without knowing what to say, the new chief told everybody that there would be somewhat moderate cold this year, so they don't need a lot of wood. Everyone from the village went to the forest to chop the trees and gather wood. However, the new chief became really nervous about what he said. So he sneaked into the nearest town and bought a small radio to get the local weather forecast. That night, tuning the radio, he heard that the weather guy is saying, this year the winter will be cold and asking everyone to get prepared for it. Hearing this, the new chief decided to gather some more wood, just to be in the safe side. The next day, he gathered everyone and told them to gather some more, as the winter would be colder than he anticipated earlier. That night, he again turned on the radio and to his dismay, he found out that now the radio is saying this season will be much colder. So, the next day he asked everyone to chop some more. Again, at night he found out with sheer frustration that the radio is saying, this year the temperature would reach the lowest among the last few years. So, he told his people to get more wood. This time, he found that the radio is saying, this year the temperature would reach such low that it would break any previous record. Hearing this, he went berserk and stormed to the radio office, and asked the weather guy, what is your problem? Why are you changing the forecast every single day? The weather guy replied, okay, we actually guess the severity of the winter from the amount of wood the Red Indians gather. This year, they started nice and slow and we broadcasted that it would be a moderate winter, then they increased speed and we assumed it would be a little more cold; but now, now they are cutting down the whole forest!",{Long} The Red Indian chief,8

When they decided to go down to the nitty gritty they found out they have no money left for the hotel room and knew already the ladies wouldn't do anything on the car so they remembered that his friend Johnny lived alone and they concluded there would be not problem getting rooms since Johnny, let’s put it this way, wasn’t the brightest light in the house.

They came to Johnny’s and made their request. To their surprise he agreed but only on the condition that they provide a lady for him too. They were shocked and almost desisted upon the reasoning that no girl would be willing to dance the naked cha cha with such a fool. Then inspiration came from above (and obviously fuelled by some part of their bodies in the verge of exploding):

-	Dude, don’t you have one of those inflatable dolls in the trunk?
-	Yes, why?
-	Let’s give it to him
-	Man, he will notice
-	Nah, let’s just tell him she’s mute and into rubber stuff but we need to remove  the lightbulb from the socket before he have a chance to see.

So they did after taking Johnny apart while the other one arranged said set up. After that they went to take care of the drilling job I’m not going into further detail since most of you been there and done that.

Next day they talked about the happenings and decided to mock poor Johnny and have some laugh so off they went

-	So Johnny, how it went with the girl?
-	Dude, that chick was weird as fuck!
-	How so?
-	I started to caress her legs and nothing, no response; then I dared to touch her tit and again no reaction.
-	So what did you do?
-	I bit her nipple and that’s when the hell broke loose: she farted very loud and escaped through the open window!

After many days of looking with no luck, one of his friends, Nate, tells him about this neato job as a yard cleaner for a private neighborhood. Not really seeing any point in declining, Anges agrees.


The first day of the job, after going through a couple easy (although a bit strange) interviews, he officially meets his boss, Mr. Mass. Mr. Mass shakes his hand firmly, and welcomes him to the team.


“Hey Anges, nice to have you here! Now, I know you know this already, but I'll just go over it with you one more time; we work for various private neighborhoods and do basic yard maintenance, like mowing lawns and such. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it in no time!” He pats Anges on the shoulder and heads off somewhere else.


Anges heads off into another room and runs into his friend, now coworker, Nate.


“Hey, welcome abroad! Don't worry about all that casual stuff,” he motions to the tie Anges was wearing. “We're gonna be getting a bit dirty in this job, yard work and all. You wanna dress for the occasion!” He gives him a pat on the back as well and leads him off to meet the other workers.


A couple of days later, the two are out in a neighborhood mowing the lawns. Nate and Anges are on one yard, and Mr. Mass is on another yard. Their coworkers are spread throughout the rest of the block. Anges looks over the fence to Mr. Mass and decides to crack a joke about the sunny weather. Mr. Mass looks up at him and points angrily.


“Hey, dumbass! Get back to work or it's coming out of all our paychecks!” He yelled, adding a couple more insults to his berating. Anges is very taken aback, as Mr. Mass had been a lot nicer when he'd first met him. He turns to Nate and asks him about it.


“Hey, Nate, what's going on with Mr. Mass?” He asked.


Nate turned to him. “Aw, sorry about that, Anges. We shoulda warned you about Mr. Mass during work.”


“What, is he just a little feisty under the sun?”


“Yeah, pretty much.”


Anges looked over at Mr. Mass again. “Well, this is kinda sucky now, I thought he was nice.”


“He is! It's just, you know. The Mass is always meaner on the other side of the fence.”

The doc and his team of assistants check it out and then asked the other tech to come over and get me some novacaine while they go to another patient.  The other tech was way over on the other side of the room just kinda hanging out and relaxing all by himself.  He came over, introduced himself as Juan, and got to work.  I told him that I've got a high tolerance for novocaine and he kind of said ""Yeah, everyone says that.  We'll see.""  Did a great job and I think we're going to be fine.

So Juan and I kind of hang out for a few minutes while it takes effect.  He's not much for conversation and just tidys up for a few until I feel some numbness.  He leaves and the doctor and team comes back.  They try to get started, but almost immediately I let them know that I still have feeling in the tooth.  So we either have to wait, or give more novocaine.  He chooses to do more. 

His team leaves, back comes Juan from the other room.  He gives me another shot and just sits down.  He’s got no phone, no book, no talking.  Just kinda hangs out and stares at things.  It’s weirdly uncomfortable. 10 minutes later, here comes the doc and his team again, and Juan leaves.  As he's leaving, he tells the doc that he's going to lunch, and this worries me becuase I'm still definitely not numb.  The doc attempts to start and... WOW.  That's definitely not numb.  

The doc tries to blame Juan but I let him know that he did a good job and I know he gave me a lot, just that I have a high tolerance and it takes forever for me to get numb.  So they all leave for a minute and a new person comes by to numb me.  Her name is Susan, and she's friendly and knows exactly what to do.  She gives me what can only be described as a heroic dose of novocaine.  I think my hair is going to go numb from this.  Susan is my new best friend.  However, she just finishes up, cleans up around a bit, then goes and sits all the way on the other side.  And I can see, there's no TV in there, she's not using her phone or reading, she's just sitting there.

The doc comes back with the rest of his team of techs and I'm just facinated by this interaction so I have to ask.  Through my now mumbled and numb mouth I manage to ask quietly ""Not complaining, but everyone here is so friendly.  But what is up with these two that only seem to do the novocaine injections?  They just go off in that quiet room and seem like they don't want to talk or anything.""



The doc tells me ""Juan is the loneliest numb-er that you'll ever choose.  Sue can be as bad as Juan.  She's the loneliest numb-er since the numb-er Juan.""",Had the strangest experience at the dentist.,3

Oh! Glad you asked. This pig, he's something else. Last year, we had a fire in the house. Flames and smoke everywhere. We all got out in time but then my wife notices our daughter is still inside. While we panic, that pig jumps into the house and comes back out a couple minutes later with our daughter, safe and sound. 

That's amazing says the guy! Unbelievable. 

That's not all. 6 months ago, my young boy fell into the pool and started drowning.  None of us can swim. While we panic, that pig jumps out of nowhere, and pulls my kid out of the water saving his life. 
That is absolutely astounding! says the guy.   

That's not all! Just last month we had a burglary at night. We were held at gun point in our house. Before you know it, pig jumps through the window, headbutts the burglar and knocks him unconscious, then he goes to the phone and dials 999 for us to get the police to come pick the burglar up.

""Thank goodness!"" the motorist thought, and was approaching to knock on the front door to ask to use the phone. At that point, however, he had a clear view into the home's well-lighted living room, in which stood a very old and very naked man and woman. The woman was squeezing her breasts, and the old man was beating his dick repeatedly with an umbrella.

""Oh hell no,"" thought the motorist, not wanting to get involved in some weird sex scene in the middle of nowhere, so he went back to the road and continued walking.

He finally reached the next farmhouse, approached, and knocked on the door. The friendly couple who lived there invited him in, let him use the phone, and offered him some coffee while he waited.

Finally his curiosity got the better of him and he said to his new hosts: ""Hey, I hope this isn't awkward, but I really want to know what's up with your neighbors.""

""What about them?""

The motorist described what he'd seen through the living room window of the first farmhouse.

It bounced on the ground and straight into a drain grate. For a minute he just stared at it, he could not believe his bad luck. Then he sat down on ground crying, feeling beaten and utterly hopeless. He would never get there in time.

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.

The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'

The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.

She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'

'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.

'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

'So I just switched the heads.'",A man who'd just died is delivered to a local mortuary,3

As he is sitting there, a small girl runs out onto the icy lake chasing her ball and the homeless man hears the lake ice start to crack so he gets up and runs across the lake, scoops the girl up and runs back, all without making a sound. As he gets back a man runs towards him wearing a very expensive coat. When the man gets there, he says to the homeless man “Thank you so much for saving my only daughter, I’m very rich and can give you any reward that you could dream off”. Despite the homeless man telling him that he doesn’t need any reward, he eventually gives in and says that all he wants is £10 as that used to be a lot of money when he was a child and he didn’t want to take too much from the man. The rich man is mildly interested as to why the homeless man would want so little and so asks why that is the case, “well you see” replied the homeless man “I’ve been having a stressful time recently, so I really fancy going on a holiday”. The rich man chuckled at this, told the homeless man that he might have a hard time finding a holiday for that cheap but still wished him the best of luck.

The next day, the homeless man still full of happiness at the thought of a holiday walked into the travel agent nearest to him, walked right up to one of the staff and told them “Hi, I’m here for a holiday.” After asking for the budget for the holiday, the worker starts to apologise to the homeless man telling him “Our company doesn’t currently have any holidays for only £10 however I can look out back in storage in case there are any old holidays that have been taken out of the system due to no one buying them” and so the worker went into the back to look for a holiday for the homeless man as he felt sorry for him. After half an hour of waiting, the worker finally returned red in the face from the search looking happy and clutching a paper file, he walked up to the homeless man and said to him “You’re in luck! We have one cruise holiday that is just in your budget, and luckily for you it just so happens to be on a luxury cruise liner! The only stipulation is that you meet the captain down by the port tomorrow at midnight.” The homeless man doesn’t care about the weird rule and is overjoyed at the thought of a holiday, he happily takes his ticket and starts to head towards the nearest dock.

The next night, at midnight, the homeless man walks down to the port and is greeted by the biggest boat that he has ever seen. The boat towers two hundred meters above him and stretches back at least four hundred meters, the sides were a shining white even in the dead of night with perfectly round windows lining the side at regular intervals. The homeless man is amazed at his good fortune the homeless man starts to walk towards the ship. As he got nearer he saw a man in full uniform standing next to the gangplank smoking, the light of the cigarette just illuminating the man’s face. When the homeless man reached him, the captain threw what was left of his cigarette into the water behind him and looked at the homeless man with a tired smile, he introduced himself as the captain of the giant ship behind him and after checking the homeless man’s ticket he invited him onto the ship.

Walking onto the deck of the ship, the homeless man looked down at the ground behind him and marvelled at just how small everything seemed from on top the deck. The two of them continued walking until they reached a door marked “cabins”, they walked through, and the homeless man was met with grandeur that he’d never seen before. In front of him was the first-class cabin hallway, it was as high as a double-decker bus and as wide as three, the floor was pure marble making a beautiful pattern all along the floor, the walls were a perfect white with gold detailing linking between genuine Van Gogh’s and painting from other famous artists that sat between each mahogany door to each cabin. Above then were gold chandeliers that made the tapestry on the ceiling flicker with the candle light. They continued down a flight of stairs to the second-class level which was equally as magnificent, the only change being that the hallway was just a little smaller and the paintings just a little less expensive. 

This continued as they went down the ship, passing casinos, ball rooms, restaurants, and the crew quarters, getting less and less extravagant, until they finally reached the very lowest point of the ship. This corridor was small and dingy, only just big enough for the two men to walk besides each other. They walked until they reached a single door at which the captain stopped and opened it for the homeless man. Inside was a room only four by four meters wide. The only things in the room were a bed, a bedside table and an alarm clock. Turning to the homeless man, the captain explained “Since this cruise usually cost people so much, we can’t let the first-class passengers see you as they will want a refund and our company will lose everything. Due to this, you can only go out during the night which is what the alarm clock is for. All facilities are open to you during your stay however if you go out during the day you will have to leave us. I hope that you enjoy your cruise.” The homeless man didn’t care about the overall look, he was just happy to finally have a room to himself regardless of quality and so agreed.

For the next few days, the homeless man had the time of his life. Sleeping by day, up and around the boat by night – he loved every second. Go Karting, archery, rock climbing, more food than he had ever seen in his life, everything was perfect.

On night, around a week or so into his stay, he found a diving pool while strolling around so he decided to give it a try. He climbed up the ladder for the diving board, curled his toes over the side of the board, looked down and bounced. He flew high into the air, turned at the very apex of his jump and went into the water like an arrow, barely a ripple went out from where he entered. Unknown to the homeless man, the ship’s captain had been watching then entire time as he had grown fond of the homeless man and his endless happiness regardless of his circumstances. The captain came walking up to the homeless man as he was getting out of the water and voiced his amazement, “Bloody hell, that was brilliant, I’ve never seen anything like that before, where did you learn to dive like that?” the homeless man was a little shocked that he had been watched but quickly got over it, “Well that was my first time actually. I’ve never had the chance to dive before.” The captain thought for a second before finally saying “You know what, with a talent like that I think everyone should see it. How’s this for an idea, you carry on training to dive and we’ll put on a show for the passengers. We’ll even pay you to perform and you can live on this ship in a bigger cabin” the homeless man barely thinks for even a second before enthusiastically replying “it’s a deal” and then while still wearing the biggest smile he could possible produce he got back to diving.

Over the next few days, the homeless man trained relentlessly, learning all sorts of tricks like spinning, front flips, back flips, absolutely everything he could think of that people might like.

Eventually it got to the day, a massive diving board had been erected specially for the event reaching all the way into the heavens. The homeless man walked out into the waiting crowd, all displaying shock at a homeless person suddenly walking into their midst. The homeless man walks up to the ladder of the diving board and starts to climb up

and up, and up, and up, and higher, and higher, the ship below him growing smaller, and smaller, and smaller, past the clouds, past an airplane with people looking out the windows in shock, until finally, he reached the top. The homeless man goes to the end of the diving board, looks at the below him, takes a deep breath, springs, and jumps.

He performs a graceful arc then starts to fall

straight into the rock of the seabed, drilling a 10-meter shaft in the process.

The homeless man struggled for air, his whole body screaming for it. He managed to just claw his way to the surface of the water to the deafening sound of applause from all those watching.

The captain threw the homeless man a lifebuoy and lifted the exhausted man back onto the boat before telling him “That was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life, that was truly astonishing! But tell me, how did you manage to go through all of that and survive?”

The homeless man looks at the captain and gathers enough energy to tell him “Well you see, I’ve been a poor homeless man for all my life, and you must understand that I’ve been through many a hardship in my life.”",A homeless man has a holiday,160

So what happens?  Chicken runs over to the farmer's house and gets the farmers BMW.  Now it’s an 850, all black, waxed to perfection, all leather interior – it’s fucking gorgeous.  Hops in it, drives back over, ties a rope to the car and pulls his friend to safety.  The horse is grateful and says “anytime you need me, I’ll be there.""  So what happens?

The farmers lived 60 miles apart, so they decided to drive 30 miles each morning and find a field in which to let the pigs mate.  

The first morning, the farmer with the female pigs got up at 5 a.m., loaded the pigs into the family station wagon (the only vehicle he had) and drove the 30 miles.  

While the pigs were in the field mating, he asked the other farmer, ""How will I know if they are pregnant?""

The other farmer replied, ""If they're lying in the grass tomorrow
morning, they'll be pregnant.  If they're lying in the mud, they're not.""

The next morning the pigs were rolling in the mud. So he hosed them off, loaded them into the family station wagon again and proceeded to try again.

This continued each morning for more than a week and the farmers were worn out.

The next morning, one was too tired to even get out of bed. So he called out to his wife, ""Honey, please look outside and tell me whether the pigs are in the mud or in the grass.""

She told him that it was ""stuffing"". About that time, the door bell rang.

When the little boy went to answer the door, it was his grandparents. Upon opening the door, the little boy said: ""Hi bitches and bastards.
Let me take your crooked dicks and floppy tits for you. Dad's upstairs putting shit on his face and mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey.""",The day before Thanksgiving this little boy heard his mom and dad fighting....,5

You cannot touch the water twice, because the flow that has passed will never pass again. Enjoy every moment of life. As a bagpiper, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.   


I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.   


I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.   


The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full.   


As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""   


Apparently, I'm still lost....it's a man thing.",Time is like a river [long],26

Sorta clean ones:

 * How do you get a pic of three terrible people? A: Bring harambe too.

 * What did the polar seal say to the banana? Haram!    \[note by me: the spelling of haram here means ""forbidden by Islamic law""\]

 * A man walks into a bar and says, I've got a bottle of programmer. The bartender says, I'm gonna be stuck up this morning solving his problem

 * Why doesn't the chicken cross the road? To stop singing and change the world, it should have been the show to get the ball in the field.

 * I was going to put my pants in the fridge and, I'm done now.

 * When I was a book on a banana with a pizza, I was stuck in her head, and said, I don't have any politicians

 * sex with a sex is a pretty bad thing

 * If your breakfast stops talking, you're a police chicken. I'm sorry to see it with me and shot myself, it was so stupid.

 * What did the cow say to the other weed? I don't have a shot. It's about time to start the oven. The shower, she said I'm gonna get a shot in the field.

 * How do you get a book in a boat? A: The pair of shoes.

 * How many cows does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one to change and one to change it and shake.

 * The prisoner is a long leg that says to me ""you're all stupid. next time you see an arm it is the back of the world""

 * Two men walk into a bar... The bartender says.. Wow!! I don't want to help you!

 * Twitter, what happened to the constipation? He was a superman... Twitter: He wardened her friend to his wife with his family.

 * What do you call the part of the bar that has a bunch of chicken constipations and a cow? A shower.




Probably NSFW ones (some are just rude and some are vauge that might be NSFW but I'm not sure. I don't know what my neural network has against pilots):

 * I'm so fun, the people who stole my doors to try to stop me masturbating still caught me.

 * How many police does it take to marry a light bulb? Two. One to screw in an elephant.

 * Why did the chicken cross the road? To get away the prostitute that wanted to stop messing a box of potatoes.

 * What happens when you put a ban of society on earth for a car? You get a condom to seal an engineer.

 * I work in a bar and sometimes I saw him. The man that said he wouldn't be an elevator on the clothes.

 * What's a person's favorite condom? A pilot.

 * What do you call a blind man with a bird? A pilot.

 * Why do pilots have sex? Because it's too far to go to the bathroom.

 * Why do people spend all their seconds in the mall making the super balls? Because they need to be a little bigger

 * Women are like a princess person. The boss is a condom.

 * I was sitting in a bar and asked the doctor... I don't know, I was tripping out.

 * How many fire does it take to change a light bulb? Well, they both have sex..... They're all too fun to put out...

 * What did Jack Caser do? Him: I'm a pregnant party.

 * What's the difference between priests and the marine? They both have sex with a polar bear.

 * What does a pizza and a pizza do? They both have sex with a little bit of the comments

 * Why do they have a picture of their penis? Because they're going to be a programmer or a terrorist..

 * When I was a great penis, I wouldn't see my friends. I had to pay them to their hands and wait... I didn't have to be the woman.. ... because I won't start going to see if it said they're also starting.

 * Mod: I had a sex, then a car with a stranger said they want their body today. Then the sex says I have to get the most bread.

 * I hate going to stay in a restaurant as the wheelchair to see you say that she's great to be a prostitute. That's wrong.

 * How many people does it take to change a light bulb? Two. One to change a lightbulb and one to pull out and say he won't hide him and says, Why? I'm sorry for the sex.

 * A man asks, Do you want to be seen as a picture to the world? The penis says, I don't know. I don't know, I don't hear a lot like my way.

As she turns around, her worst nightmare materializes in the form of a salesman standing right behind her.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why so glum, chum?"" John Richard Cornelius O'Malley O'Hare asked as he approached the morose figure.

&amp;#x200B;

 The man's voice was faint and lifeless as he mumbled out a reply. ""...apple...apple...""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, John Richard Cornelius O'Malley O'Hare had gone on a bit of a health kick, trying to lose a few pounds, and so he happened to have an apple tucked away in his bag for a snack. However, this poor, dejected fellow obviously needed it more than he, so John Richard Cornelius O'Malley O'Hare reached in and pulled out the shiny red fruit, before offering it out to the man. ""Here you go, my friend.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man stared down at the offering, before slowly shaking his head. He reached out, bypassing the outstretched hand to latch onto John Richard Cornelius O'Malley O'Hare's shirt, taking hold and lifting a haunted gaze up to meet John Richard Cornelius O'Malley O'Hare's own curious eyes.

So the traveller sat down in the dining hall with all the other monks and ate their humble meal with them. But as soon as they were done one of the monks stood up and said ""Fifteen"", at this all the other monks had a small chuckle. Then another monk stood up and said ""Twenty Three"" and again there was a small laugh amongst the monks.

Confused, the traveller asked the monk next to him ""What's going on? Why are you laughing at numbers"". The monk replied ""Well, we don't get many new jokes here and we've all heard them all, so to save time we just numbered them all and then we remember the joke when the number is said"".

Intruiged, the traveller asked if he could have a go and the monk agreed. And so the traveller stood up and said ""Erm... Two Hundred and Sixty Seven""... Dead Silence. Every head turned towards the traveller, and lingered for a moment. Then the lead monk  began to laugh a little bit, and then another monk and another and before long the whole room was in an uproar of laughter that lasted for 5 minutes straight.

Drunkard: “It's a Muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers. Low grade, but acceptable.” 

Admin: ""That's correct, have another glass...”

Admin: ""Correct, what about this third glass?”

Drunkard: ""It's a Pinot Blanc Champagne, high grade and exclusive,''

After dinner, the male asks the woman if she wants to go up to his hotel room.
