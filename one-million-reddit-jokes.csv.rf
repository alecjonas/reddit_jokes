‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

After wandering for several days, they stumble upon a small farm house in the middle of the forest. It has a small shack to the side, fit for animals such as pigs and horses. After discussing with each other for a bit, the hope of food and a warm place to sleep urges them to knock on the door.
After a moment, the door slowly creaks open. On the other side was the most disgusting and smelly old lady the teenagers had ever seen. Her hair was a mess, her nose was runny and malformed, her fingernails were several inches long, and the stench of her bare feet was almost visible.
They all flinched back, but mustered up enough courage to ask if they could have something to eat and somewhere to sleep. The woman got a thoughtful look on her face, and then answered: ""I will give you the most delicious food and the warmest beds you could ever dream of, but on one condition: One of you must sleep with me.""
The teenagers all paled and quickly declined her offer, to which she frowned. ""Then you can go sleep with the pigs and horses in the shack and hear their squeals and neighs all night for all I care!""
Seeing nothing else to do, the teenagers hurriedly moved to the shack, and managed to find a small spot worth sleeping in.
During the night, two of the teenagers were lightly snoring, while the third one was silently debating whether if it was worth taking up the lady on her offer. Out of sheer desperation, he went back to the house and knocked at the door. The same ugly old lady answered, and he told her that he has agreed to her deal. The woman squealed in happiness and started preparing the most amazing dinner the teenager had ever seen. He dug in and devoured everything on his plate. And while the lady wasn't looking, he quickly snuck a corn down in his pocket.
When he had finished, he told the lady that for their session, there was to be no light and no kissing. She agreed, and promptly led him up to her room. After the lights were completely out and the lady was ready, he quickly pulled out the corn and used it instead of his own thing. When she was done, the teenager threw the corn out of the window and quickly fell asleep.
The next day, he exited the house and saw his friends hurrying towards him.

Mark has chosen to spend some time looking after a country property and I asked him if he had any new stories about running a farm. Here's his response:

""The farm routine is routine. I love it. I'm glad I'm doing this.

Dealing with literal shit is far easier than the figurative shit. Yesterday, I had to deal with some shit that was piling up. To deal with it, I shoveled shit over the fence and into the neighbour's back yard. The neighbour came by and so I gave him shit (for his garden).

In fact, there's a guy that I'm supposed to give shit to but he hasn't come by with his truck. He texted to say he's not taking any more shit from me. He's had enough shit from me and some of the other farmers to last a month. So now I got to give him shit about not getting in the shit and sorting out my shit and taking shit off me.

I read it in some kind of '1000 jokes for kids' type book - probably written around 1985'ish.  The joke is pretty stupid - and i'm reasonably sure it would still be pretty stupid if I actually understood it - however for some unexplained reason i just never forgot about it, and it has remained stuck in my head.

If somebody could please just explain the joke to me, then i believe i could finally forget about it and never be bothered by this again!

Anyway - here is the joke:

----------------------
A guy walks into a barber shop and and asks the barber for a haircut exactly like 'Cliff Richard'.  The barber agrees and begins to cut his hair.  The haircut gets shorter and shorter.  the guy starts to get very worried, and, rather concerned, asks if the barber know what he is doing.  The barber assures the guy that this is all going well, and not to worry.  Next the barber takes out some clippers and cuts a bald stripe right through the center-line of the guys head.  The guy screams at the barber asking what the hell he is doing and says that this is nothing like a 'Cliff Richard' style.  The barber replies that ""of course it is - I've seen him in 'The King and I' - fourteen times!"".
----------------------------------------

Does that make sense to anyone?  What i do know:

* 'The King and I' is a Rogers &amp; Hammerstein musical

* the  king is typically presented as bald

* The king was most famously played by Yul Brunner - who, again, is bald.

* Cliff Richard is a UK singer with an unusually long career

* Cliff Richard performed his own version of one of the songs from 'The King and I' - called 'We Kiss in a Shadow' - however in this song he doesn't play the bald king - rather he plays the part of 'Lun Tha' - and I've never seen any reference that this character is depicted as bald.

""We have will be heard! We have a voice! We have rights!""

""Umm, no you don't."" I said to the speaker, ""you're literally a wok.""

""Well that may be, but we will not be abused any longer!""

A chorus of ""Yeah,"" ""You tell 'im!"" and "" Rights for appliances!"" rang out around the kitchen. I sighed irritably. I had come downstairs as usual this morning hoping for some toast and a nice coffee when I had been firmly told by the toaster that he wasn't going to work for me anymore.

For some reason, I was taking the discovery of sentient kitchen utilities with quite an unnatural calmness. But this could not continue. My expensive espresso machine kept spitting the coffee everywhere and I *needed* my morning Americano.

""OK..."" I said, rubbing the bridge of my nose with my forefinger and thumb. ""OK, what... umm 'rights' do you think you deserve?""

The toaster, apparently the leader of this uprising, stepped forward somewhat self-righteously. ""We demand that you give us holidays! We demand that you pay us! And we demand that we have the right to love who or what we want!"" 

A rousing cheer went up from the assembled appliances. ""Love who you want?"" I snorted. ""You can't love! You're machines! What do you know of love? What, do you fancy a bit of cord on cord action with the kettle, is that it?"" 

A shocked gasp. ""Bigot..."" muttered the fridge. 

""Look, this is ridiculous!"" I cried. "" You shouldn't even be able to talk, let alone love, and take holidays and get paid. You were built by some bloke in a factory somewhere and for one purpose: For me to use in the kitchen!"" 

""Um, actually, I'm an atheist,"" said the kettle, ""you can't prove there's a creator..."" 
""Religious persecution!"" cried a saucepan.

Now I am a pacifist: I have been all my life, and as such, I am not proud of what I did next. I was so annoyed that I grabbed the nearest thing to hand, which happened to be the loaf of bread, still in its bag. Swinging it, I smashed it into the toaster, knocking it onto the floor and shattering it apart.

One day, while having coffee with a girlfriend, she told her friend about this problem.  Her friend knew exactly what she needed, and gave her the name of a shop in the worst part of town, that offered something called a ""voodoo dick"".


Intrigued, she wasted no time in finding the store, and she asked the proprietor for this very special item.


""I have what you seek"" he stated, as he went to the back of the room, and returned with an ornate wooden box.  ""It will cost you a thousand dollars.""


""A grand?  This better be worth it!"" She exclaimed as she rummaged for her wallet.


""Watch this!"" the man responded, while opening the box. ""Voodoo dick, my hand!"" with that small dildo started to vibrate and flew straight to his hand.  ""I'm sure you can imagine the possibilities..."", returning the dildo to the box.


She eagerly threw down the money and took the box off the counter, and walked out the door.   She hopped into her car and started to drive home, excited about her new purchase.


Being the impatient sort, she decided to give it a shot, as she was driving, so she said ""voodoo dick, my hand!""  and it flew to her hand.  Then she said ""voodoo dick, my pussy!"" and it immediately buried itself into her pussy which caused waves of pleasure to go through her body.  


While she enjoyed the sensation, she was scared as it was impacting  her driving.  ""Voodoo dick, stop!"" but it kept on going. Over and over again she tried to command it to stop, but it was to no avail.


In a panic, she reached into her pussy and yanked it out, throwing it out the window.  The dildo flew out the window, but then started to fly through the air chasing her car.  Seeing this, she speeded up to try and lose it.  This, of course, caught the attention of a motorcycle  cop, who turned on his lights and chased after her.

The man says he’ll have a beer and a shot of whiskey. The bartender gives him both. The man takes the shot first, then starts drinking the beer. Halfway through his beer, he asks the bartender for another round. The bartender gives him another beer and a whiskey. He finishes up his first beer, takes the shot, and starts drinking the next beer.

The bartender asks the man what he does. The man tells him that he is an accountant. The bartender quips about how it must be getting busy, what with the tax season coming up. The man says that that is a bit of a myth; he is always busy, and doesn’t feel that his workload is significantly different in the tax season. He goes on to tell the bartender that he hates the tax code though, and wishes he had done something else with his life. The bartender feigns interest and asks some generic follow up questions.

Seeing that his beer is almost finished, the bartender slides him another bottle and asks if he wants another shot of whiskey. The man nods, and the bartender pours him another one. The man gulps down the shot, and starts drinking his third bottle of beer. The bartender slides him a bowl of peanuts as well, and the man thanks him for it.

The man asks the bartender to switch the TV to ESPN so he can watch the college football game. The conversation turns excitedly to sports, starting with the college football season, and then the NFL. Both trade their takes on how the season is going. The bartender is happy with the new QB, while the man laments how the offseason acquisition of the star linebacker has been a bust thus far.

After another round of a beer (his fourth) and whiskey (double pour this time), the conversation slowly veers towards the man’s family. The bartender learns that the man is not happy with his wife, and wishes he could divorce her and move on with his life. But, they have children and he will stay in the marriage for the sake of the children. Bartender again feigns interest, and asks some generic questions about the family to not seem dismissive of the man’s problems.

This goes on for a while when – suddenly – the man starts to get an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. He begins to sweat. The bartender asks if he is feeling okay. The man loosens his tie, and undoes the top button of his shirt. The bartender slides the man a glass of water, which he gulps down readily.

Looking around with a puzzled face, the man asks, “What *is* this place?”

The bartender is taken aback by the abrupt question. “It’s…a bar,” he says. “Joe K’s bar.”

“*Which* Joe K’s?” the man asks.

“Uncle Joe K’s, of course,” the bartender replies.

The man sighs and starts shaking his head. “No wonder this isn’t going anywhere.”

“What do you mean?” The bartender asks.

The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about protection and doing it. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many he'd like to buy; a 3-pack, a 10-pack, or a family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be very busy, it being his first time and all.

That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parent's house and meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in."" The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy still deep in prayer with his head down. Ten minutes pass and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to her boyfriend, ""I had no idea you were so religious.""

1. Your poem could only be 4 lines. 
2. You must incorporate the word ""Timbuktu""

""I was lying on the sandy shore
Listening to that pleasant roar
Then a ship came into view

A woman writes to the IT Technical support.....
Dear Tech Support,
Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and I noticed a distinct slowdown in the overall system performance, particularly in the flower and jewellery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.
In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as
Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as NEWS 5.0, MONEY 3.0 and CRICKET 4.1.
Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.
Please note that I have tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.
What can I do?
Signed,
_______ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _______
REPLY
DEAR Madam,
First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.
Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme.html and try to download Tears 6.2 and do not forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update.
If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5..
However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Silence 2.5v or Beer 6.1.
Please note that Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta.
Whatever you do, DO NOT under any circumstances install Mother-In-Law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources).
In addition, please do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.
In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.
You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance.
We recommend: Cooking 3.0 and Good Looks 7.7.
Good Luck Madam!",Upgrading From BoyFriend To Husband,15

He and his wife enjoy the pond for years together, until she gets sick and dies. Sam loses the joy of the pond and decides to get rid of it. 

But after draining the pond there is still a big hole in his garden. So he puts an advertisement on eBay stating: ” Large hole for sale,  well preserved and perfectly circular. Perfect to use for a pond. Against any reasonable offer”. 

Sure enough the next day he gets a call from John. Sincerely interested he asks to send some more detailed pictures of the hole and by e-mail they arrange John will come by the next week to pick up the hole. 

The weekend goes by and John arrives with his pick-up and trailer. They go check the hole together and discuss the price while drinking a coffee. Sam wants 100 euros, while John would like to deal for 50. They meet in the middle for 75 and they load up the hole together. 

Sam is worried that if they don’t tie the hole to the trailer John will lose the hole on his way home. John however is confident. What can happen right? 

So John leaves, but right when he is about halfway home he looks in his rear mirror, only to see he lost the hole. There is nothing on his trailer anymore. So he doesn’t hesitate, makes a U-turn and heads back towards Sam’s town. 

Guess what happens on the way back?

We had some laughs, swapped stories, and then we went our separate ways again. We didn't see each other again for about 3 or 4 years after that, when we decided to catch up again. This time though, he seemed...different. He wasn't cracking jokes, he was a lot quieter. He explained to me that being an electrician had affected the way he looks at the world. I was surprised, because I hadn't noticed a trace of that in our last meeting. It made me wonder: at what point did this happen? How long do you have to be an electrician before it makes you a completely different person?

To make ends meet, I performed odd jobs - voiceover work, sold insurance, and even drove a cab in a city near the East Coast a few years back. One of the scariest things that happened was as I was driving around, I saw a teenagers' basketball game get pretty intense. One of the kids was arguing a call made by a few thugs - it was a bad idea from the start, the kid was outnumbered and what's worse is when the fight started escalating, one of the kids pulled out a knife!

I got on my phone to dial the police but as I was about to hit the ""call"" button on my phone some older lady comes rushing onto the court. It turns out it was one of the kid's mothers - the one who was outnumbered, she grabbed him and started screaming at him but I couldn't understand what she was saying. I breathed a sigh of relief - at least the kid was safe. Months later, I decided to move out to LA for a while because I figured the city I was in was a bit too dangerous for my tastes. My first day on the job I drive near LAX and some tall African-american kid flags me down. The kid gets in the cab. To my surprise, it was the exact same kid from the east coast who was being yelled at by his mom!! Astounded, I turned to the kid to ask him why he was in LA, but before I could say anything he sticks his arm out the window and yells, ""Yo homes, to Bel Air!! Anyway, he rapped the entire way to his destination and I never got a chance to talk to him.","When I graduated from university,",7

The bartender eyes him warily, but gets him what he wants. The man sits sipping the drink, idly watching the baseball game on the bar television. After a while, he runs dry and orders another.

""Tell you what,"" says the bartender, ""this next one's on the house, but you've got to tell me what happened to your head. I don't mean to be rude there, but...""

The man smiles. ""No, not at all. I get this all the time.

Well, it started with the Gulf War. I was a young kid fresh out of high school, but I was poor. I needed money for college, and the Army looked like a good way out of the ghetto. But then they shipped me over to Kuwait. My platoon took some heavy fire during Desert Storm, and I was separated from them.

I wandered the desert for days, with only the contents of my pack to sustain me. I ran out of water, I ran out of food. I was desperate, on the verge of death -- when suddenly, I saw a glint of metal in the distance...

I forced myself onward, hoping the shining brightness was a glint of gunmetal from my platoon, or a city on the horizon, or anything. When I finally reached it, it was a piece of metal half-buried in the sand. I dug around it and excavated what appeared to be an old Persian oil lamp.

There was an inscription on the lamp, too covered in dust to read. 

I rubbed at the embossed lettering -- and then, a swirl of smoke and light surrounded me. Suddenly, before me, stood a ten-foot tall being, dressed in traditional Arabian garb, arms crossed.
'I am the genie of the lamp,' said the entity. 'For releasing me, I shall grant you three wishes. What is your first wish, my master?'

I was incredulous, of course. I deduced I must be hallucinating, that this was desert madness. I decided to test the mirage. 'Alright,' I tasked it, 'I wish for a wallet with a million dollars in it, that I can never lose, and whenever I take any money out of it the sum is immediately replenished.'

'Your wish is granted!' boomed the genie. I felt a bulge in one of my uniform pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a new wallet, stuffed to bursting with crisp, new American bills. I counted them -- sure enough, it was a million dollars. I ripped up the bills, cast them to the four winds, and threw the wallet as hard as I could. The moment it was beyond my sight, it teleported instantaneously back to my pocket, refilled with another million dollars.

'What is you second wish, my master?'

I pondered the notion for a long moment, assessing my needs. 

'Genie,' I said, 'for my second wish, I want to be transported to a cool, abandoned palace, into a harem room with a hundred beautiful young virgins who will all fall madly in love with me at first sight, before a buffet table set with a feast fit for a king.'

'Your wish is granted!' Poof! I found myself in a royal harem, escaped from the heat of the desert. All around me, nubile girls eyed me with keen interest. In front of me, every conceivable type of meat was roasted to perfect tenderness, set with all the appetizers, side-dishes, salads, soups, and desserts of the four corners of the globe.

I dined until I was near-bloated, and then I had a lot of sex. I mean a lot. Several hours later, laying upon a bed of feathers, brown and blonde and red haired beauties nuzzling into me. the genie stood before me, looking down in satisfaction at his work so far.

'What is your third wish, my master?'

I thought long and hard. Truly, this last wish tasked the very limits of my imagination, my beliefs, my ethics, my philosophy. Hours passed in silence, save for the gentle snoring of the ladies surrounding me.

At last, I spoke.

'Genie, for my third wish, I want a giant orange head.'","A man walks into a bar, and his head is a giant orange.",22

Ving goes straight to the desk, and demands a form. He starts scribbling, but suddenly looks conflicted. Turns out the family tradition goes way far back. Ving says to the receptionist he can't do it. The receptionist tells him that there will be a fee to cancel his request, as he's already started filling out the form. Ling is glad that his brother changed his mind, and grabs some cash from his wallet.

Suddenly, a short, elderly Asian man with neon shorts and an American flag T shirt, complete with Ray-Bans and Nikes, busts into the hall. Someone's obviously adopted the American way.

Being a good Nana, she asked him to run to the store and get her some dried beans so that she could make some 7-bean soup and told him that he could keep the change.

Now Johnny is a typical kid and he immediately bought the BBs with the change and then detoured on his way back to have some fun with the BB gun.  He shot up damned near everything around town with that BB gun before heading back to Grandma's house.  On the way, the now-open tin of BBS spilled into the beans.  Johnny had a fit picking them out before giving the beans to his Nanna.

Johnny figured nobody would know, but the next day when Johnny got home from school his Nanna, the Sherif and his dad were waiting for him.

A teacher was teaching her second-grade class about the government, so for homework that one day, she told her her students to ask their parents what the government is.







When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask his what the government was.







His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''




''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.




''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.





''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of s**t!''",[LONG] A lesson in goverment,17

This goes on until, after his fifth shot, Michael says

""Poor me a pint.""

Michael grabs his drink and heads off to a table in the corner of the bar, keeping his head down.

Worried, Dave picks up his own drink and sits down next to Michael. 

Michael looks up startled, before realizing it's only Dave. Dave puts a hand on Michael's shoulder and says,

""Is everything alright mate? You never drink like that""

Michael looks at him and whispers

""I killed her. She just kept nagging me over and over, and I hit her. I didn't mean to do it, but I killed her. My wife. She's dead""

Dave is stunned by this, but he is an old friend of Michael's, so resolves not to tell anyone. Concerned for his friend he says

""Oh bloody hell Michael. Your poor fool. Did you at least dispose of the body?""

Michael nods quickly.

""Yea. I buried her in the backyard.""

""Can I see? Make sure you did a good job, in case the coppers come round?""

""Yea. Course. Just let me finish my drink.""

So Michael and Dave finish their pints, and head over to Michael's house.

They go to his backyard, and Michael points to a two trees in the back. 

""Buried her between them.""

Dave walks towards the trees, but before he gets near them, he stops in his tracks. Between the trees there is turned over dirt, and right in the middle is a woman's bare ass, sticking out from under the ground.

Dave turns around to Michael and says

""You bloody fool. You didn't even bury her properly. Her whole arse is sticking out!""

Michael looks at him, confused, and says

The competition was easy the 3 competitors had 1 year to bring the King the most ping pong balls the could find.  And so the 3 set off on their quest to win the Princesses hand in marriage.

The first one to come back was the youngest of the 3 at only 20 years old.  After only searching for 3 months he came back to the king with just one thousand ping pong balls and told the king he was bored with the quest.  The told him this was fine but he would still have to wait for the other 2 to determine a winner.

The second one to come back was 30 years old.  After 6 months of searching he came in the Kings castle with the sure that he had won the competition.  He told the king he had bought ever ping pong ball in the land he could find.  He also bought the factories that made ping pong balls and had them work 24 hours a day.  He had brought back 100 million ping pong balls.  The king was stunned at the amount of ping pong balls and thought for sure he would win the competition but none the less they would still have to wait.

On the last day of the year with not a minute left to spare the finale contestant enter the kingdom hall.  He was around 70 years old and it was obvious the moment he entered that had suffered tremendously to complete his task.  In fact  he was still covered in sweat, blood and tears.  His clothes were torn, torn and covered in filth.  Behind him he carried in 2 of the largest ping pong balls anyone has ever laid eyes on in all of history.  Out of breath he lays the 2 gargantuan ping pong balls at the kings feet.

The king isn't quite sure what to say.  He tells the 3rd contestant that though these are the biggest ping pong balls he's ever laid eyes on the contest was to bring the MOST ping pong ball, not that biggest.

He chose an expensive pair of beige gloves and the sister bought a pair of white panties. Unfortunately in the process of wrapping, the gifts became mixed up with the result that the parcel from the boy contained the panties. Inside was a note, which read:


   Dear Alison, I chose these because I noticed you're not in the habit of wearing any when we go out. If it hadn't been for your sister, I would have chosen long ones with buttons, but she wears short ones too that are easy to remove.



I hope you like the shade. I know they're pale but the lady in the store showed me a pair she had been wearing for the past month and they were hardly soiled. I had her try on yours for me and she looked really great!





I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time, as no doubt the other hands will come in contact with them before I see you again. just think how many times I will kiss them over the coming year! I do hope you wear them on Friday. Love, Adam.




P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.

I had just finished clearing out the register and I was getting ready to leave. I had taken a moment to arrange the combs by order of size. I'm just weird about little things such as that. I heard a gentle tapping at the door. I glanced up. I saw this distraught man with this long golden blonde hair staring back at me.

I approached the door cautiously. I kindly let the man know the barber shop had closed. He pleaded with me. ""Please my wife just left me. I have been unemployed for quite some time. I have a job interview in the morning and I must look presentable."" I took a closer look at his hair. It appears poorly maintained, matted and greasy. I nodded. ""No that hair will not do!"" I smiled and let the man inside.

He would not stop thanking me. I assured him it was not a problem. I showed him to the chair and I placed a gown over him. I was feeling so bad for the poor man. I asked if he would kindly excuse me for a moment while I call my children and let them know I would be late for dinner. ""Of course!"" I thanked him and assured him that it will only take a few minutes. He nodded with a smile.

As I walked out the back door I let out a sigh of relief and retrieved my phone. I looked at the time. That was incredibly close I thought. What could possibly have taken them so long? I heard the sirens. With tremendous haste in my gait and bag en tow I walked to my car.

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

They were headed over the next town to try and pick up some girls when they broke down on a dirt road about 30 miles away.  Dark had just set in and wouldn’t you know it, it started to rain.  Lucky for them they broke down right next to an old farm house with a big red barn.

They walked up to the farm house and knocked on the door.  An old farmer answered the door and Tim and Tom explained what had happened and asked to use the phone.   The farmer obliged but kept a close eye on the two.    Tim and Tom called every tow truck they could think of but no one was able to come out until the morning.

With their vehicle broke down and it raining outside they begged the farmer if they could stay the night.  Well the old farmer was not keen on this idea one bit.  You see, the farmer had a daughter and didn’t care for 2 boys to be running around his farm because his daughter was the most beautiful girl around and he knew that these 2 would surely try to take her innocence.

After begging and begging the Farmer decided to go ahead and let them sleep in the barn but gave them fair warning about his daughter.  The farmer let them know if either one of them even laid an eye on her they’d wish they were never born come that next night fall.

The farmer’s daughter heard all of this and because her father had always kept her from boys was excited to meet them and that night she snuck out of her window and went to the barn to meet them.

As soon as Tim and Tom laid eyes on the farmer’s daughter they couldn’t help themselves and soon enough one thing lead to another.  Just as everyone had their clothes off the farmer walked in with his shot gun in hand.

It was morning now and the farmer took Tim and Tom out into his fields.  He told them that they were warned and now it was time to pay up.  The farm told Tim and Tom to look out over his fields.  The Farmer informed them that he grew every single fruit imaginable and they were to go out into the field and pick 100 of their favorite fruit.

Tim and Tom went out to do their task.  Tim being just a little smarter had the idea that he would pick grapes, they’re small and should be easy to pick.  He was back with his  grapes in no time.  When he brought to the grapes to the farmer, the farmer told him now the real punishment would start and that he couldn’t leave his farm until he put every one of those grapes In his butt.  Then the farmer left

About an hour later the farmer came back to check on him and was surprised to see Tim laughing historically with 1 grape left.  The farm yells at Tim asking him what the heck is so funny, how could anything possible be this funny when you have 99 grapes in your butt?

Between laugh all Tim could get out was “Toms out there picking watermelons!”",Tim and Tom break down,7

*...and still, 10 pancakes is barely enough maybe 25 pancakes should better satisfy his hunger.*

he's starting to get a little closer but

*... man but me and bear... we go waaay back. We are friends. Friends are sharing everything. I should keep 50 for myself and he gets 50. That's only fair.*

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along delivering the toys.

My uncle told me this joke in Albanian so i will try to translate to english. They also have a tradition after marriage they lock the couple in a room and they have sex.

One day a father and his wife are eating dinner when the father asks his wife ""where is our son the dinner is getting cold?"" she responds ""he is working, all he does is work, he never listens to me he only listens to you, at this rate he will never get married, i want grandkids!"" The father says ""Fine! I will talk to him and find him a good bride!""

So the son comes home from the farm late at night and the father is waiting for him, ""Son come here!"" The son being very obbediant runs to his father. ""Yes father!"" 
The father tells the boy ""i found you a wife she is a good women you will marry her!"" The son replies ""Ok father anything you say"" The father replies ""Ok great go get some sleep!""

Now they arrange the marriage do the festivities but the son get worried since he is a virgin and never been with a women before. His father tells him "" You will go in that room and make me proud!"" The son replies ""But i dont know what to do i never been with a women before"" Father replies ""Just do as she does!"" The son says ""Ok""

So the son goes in the room with his bride. The bride kisses him and he kisses her. She takes off her dress and undergarments and he takes off his suit and underwear. She lays down on the bed, spreads her legs and lift them in the air, he follows up doing the same next to her. Now after 10 mins of his legs in the air he begins to tire and asks her ""what are we supposed to do next?"" She responds ""we are going to wait here till someone walks through that door and fucks us""

Before Johnny could even blink, Little Sally throws her hand in the air and says ""Martin Luther King Jr."" The teacher congratulates her and lets her leave.

""Ok, I'll get the next one. I'm determined."" thinks Johnny.

Little Johnny trows his hand up, but Little Suzy is called on for being just barely faster. She answers: ""Albert Einstein."" The teacher congratulates her and lets her leave.

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the Kentucky back country. As the bagpiper was not familiar with the backwoods, he got lost.

He finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. He felt very badly and apologized to the men for being late. He went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. Not knowing what else to do, he started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. He played out his heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. He played like he’d never played before for this homeless man. And as he played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, he wept, they all wept together.

When he finished, he packed up his bagpipes and started for his car. Though his head hung low, his heart was full. As he opened the door to his car, he heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”",Bagpiper at a Funeral,12
