After taking courses for 2 years the three had a good chance of passing.

It all came to a final test, a loyalty test. The instructor said to the Cajuns, ""The final test to pass to work for the FBI is the loyalty test. Pass this and you are a certified FBI agent. But it won't be easy, for you must kill your wife."" The three were walked to a hallway with 3 doors. The instructor then pulled out a gun and said, ""Behind each one of these doors is your wife. You are to walk in and kill her. That is the test.""

Now Boudreaux, Tibideaux, and Pierre didn't know that the gun was full of blanks. No bullets were actually placed in the gun, that way the men didn't actually shoot their wife.

The gun was first given to Pierre. He opened his door, walked in the room, and silence was followed for a entire minute. Eventually he walked out and said, ""I'm sorry sir, but I just can't do it.""

The gun was then given to Tibideaux. He opened his door, walked in the room, and again silence was followed for a minute. Tibideaux walked out and said, ""I'm sorry sir, but I just can't do it.""

Finally the gun was given to Boudreaux. He opened his door, walked in, and 6 shots ran out! Everything went quiet for a few seconds, then the loudest racket started out. I mean it sounded crazy in there. Then it settled, and Boudreaux walked out.

The instructor said, ""Well?""

It was hard to make out what the trees were saying, so woodpecker flew in closer to listen.  He came upon a large beech and a large birch, arguing over a young sapling that grew between them.  The beech said ""That tree is a son of a beech, it will grow to be strong and provide food to the animals of the forest."" The birch replied,"" No, it is a son of a birch, it will grow to be a mighty birch and will give man bark to start fires and build canoes."".  And so it went, the beech said it was a son of a beech and the birch said it was a son of a birch.  Woodpecker could see that the trees had grown so tall, they struggled  to see the little sapling on the forest floor.  So, woodpecker flew in closer and offered to settle the dispute.  He said to the trees ""I know trees better than any animal in the forest, let me take a closer look and I will settle this argument"". The trees happily agreed and woodpecker flew down to the young sapling.  Woodpecker spent some time, hopping on the little tree, pecking the trunk and pecking the branches.  After some time had passed, he flew back up to give his report.  Before woodpecker could say anything, the beech exclaimed ""it's a son of a beech, I know he will be a mighty beech one day"". The birch immediately followed with ""You are mistaken, he is a son of a birch, he will be a strong birch one day."" Woodpecker, having a chance to speak, finally said ""I hate to disappoint you, but it is not a son of a beech, nor is it a son of a birch.  But, that's the nicest piece of ash I ever stuck my pecker in""",Tree joke (long),17

Then I was so mad I had a heart attack and died and came here."" St. Peter said, ""It sounds like you've had it rough, so I'll let you in."" The next man walks up and gets asked the same question.

The father smiles and looks Johhny in the eyes and says ""I don't know son; does your dick reach your asshole?""   Johnny quickly ran to the bathroom to check, only to come out with his head looking down mumbling ""No sir....""   ""Well, there you have it Johnny, I will not purchase you a vehicle at this time.""

A few years passed, and now Johnny was engaged to the woman of his dreams, had a prety good job, and was trying to purchase a new home so he could raise a family. Johnnie was aprehensive about asking his father for help, but he was a few grand short , and decided to give it a shot.

""Dad, I was wondering if you could help me out with a loan to put this down payment on a new house?"" The father, never missing an opportunity, grinned and asked Johnnie ""I don't know son, does your dick reach your asshole?""

Johnnie, with his head held high looked his father right in the eyes, and said ""Why yes, yes father, it does!"" Smiling from ear to ear with confidence.  ""Great!"" The father yelled, ""Now go fuck yourself!""
","When he turned 13, little Johhny asked his father if he would buy him a new bicycle................ *NSFW*",11

But what the bear doesn't notice is there is a hunter with a sandwich watching the bear watching the fish which is watching the fly

So the hunter thinks to himself ""if that fly drops 6 inches , the fish will get the fly , the bear will get the fish and I'll shoot the bear and then I'll have a good meal""

Then a mouse sees the hunter and his sandwich and thinks to himself "" if that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will get the fly ,the bear will get the fish and the hunter will drop his sandwich and shoot the bear, then I'll take the sandwich and have a good meal""

But the mouse doesn't notice the cat behind him and the cat thinks to himself "" if that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will get the fly, the bear will get the fish, the hunter will drop his sandwich and shoot the bear, the mouse will grab the sandwich and then I'll get the mouse.

Then it happens, the fly drops 6 inches, the fish gets the fly , the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops the sandwich and shoots the bear , the mouse gets the sandwich but when the cat jumps to get the mouse it misses and falls in the river.

If that fly drops six inches, I'm gonna go up there and get that fly and have myself a real nice meal.""

What the fish didn't realize is that a bear was looking at the fish, looking at the fly. The bears thinking to itself: ""You know what? If that fly drops six inches and that fish gets that fly, I'm gonna go in there and get that fish and have my self a real nice meal.""

What the bear didn't realize is that a hunter who was eating a sandwich, was watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. The hunter is sitting there, looking at that fly and he's thinking to himself: ""You know what? If that fly drops six inches and then that fish gets that fly and that bear gets that fish, I'll put my sandwich down and shoot the bear and have my self a real nice meal."" 

What the hunter didn't realize is that there was a mouse, watching the sandwich in the hunter's hand, watching the bear, watching the fish, and watching the fly. The mouse is looking at the fly and he's thinking to himself: ""You know what? If that fly drops six inches, and that fish gets that fly, and that bear gets that fish, and that hunter drops his sandwich and gets the bear, I'm gonna have my self a real nice meal.""

What the mouse didn't realize is that there was a cat, watching the mouse, watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. The cat is sitting there and thinking to himself: ""You know what? If that fly drops six inches, and that fish gets that fly, and that bear gets that fish, and that hunter drops his sandwich and gets that bear, I'm gonna get the mouse and have myself a real nice meal.""

And then all of a sudden, it happened. The fly drops six inches, the fish gets the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops his sandwich and shoots the bear, the mouse jumps on the sandwich, but then it all went wrong. 

The cat went to jump on the mouse and missed and landed in the river. The cat got completely soaked. And I think that's something to be said for something in life.

He went to look for his tools and saw that part of his set was missing. He had a full spare and jack but his tire iron was missing for some reason. The man looked off in the distance and spied a farmhouse in the distance. With no other readily available options he decided to head up the road and ask the farmers if he could borrow a tire iron. 

As he proceeded towards the house, the man started having increasingly negative thoughts. “Watch. They probably don’t even have a tire iron.” he told himself. “Even worse, they probably do have one but will lie and say they don’t because they won’t want to lend it to a stranger.” he continued. “This sucks. Why do people have to be so distrusting?” he thought. 

Having worked himself into quite the foul mood, the man eventually reached the house and knocked on the door. One last thought ran threw his head, “I can’t believe people sometimes. If they say they don’t have a tire iron that I can use I’m going to lose my shit!” 

Just then a matronly looking woman answered the door with a kind and charming tone. “Hello?” she said, “Can I help you young man?” In a huff, the man replied, “You know what lady?

“Sir, as this is a new procedure, our pool of brains you can choose from is rather small. Prices of the brains will vary,” said the doctor. 

“Okay, show me what you’ve got. I have an important job, so I’ll need the best brain,” replies the president. 

“A South Korean brain will cost you $80,000.” 

The Mexican president widens his eyes in shock at the price. But then thinks that yes, the Koreans are smart people. It is quite understandable that a brain from there would be costly. 

“A brain from China would cost $15.000,” the doc continued, “an American one would cost $2,500, and las-“

“HAH!” The president interrupted. “And those dumb Americans are always looking down on us. Look at their cheap ass brains!” The Mexican president smirks to himself. 

“As I was saying,” continued the doctor, “ lastly, a Mexican brain would cost $150,000.”

Immediately, the president’s chest swells with pride, thinking what great minds his country has. 

“I’ll take the Mexican brain!” He exclaims, almost with a tear in his eye. 

After the operation, when the president is recovering, he begins to wonder and asks how the brains were priced. 

“Ah, you see, China has no shortage of brains from people getting terminated for unknown reasons. However, censorship and propaganda limits and degrades the brain somewhat. Hence the lower price. The Americans gorge their minds on social media, low quality entertainment and useless things like conspiracy theories. This combination really harms their brains, and the nonsense their president spouts also exacerbates this,” the doc adds with a slight smile. 

“What about Mexican brains? They’re the most expensive and therefore the best, right?” 

“Yes. They are the freshest minds with the most potential because most of them have never been used and are good as new.” ",The Mexican president has a rare cancer of the brain and is in need of a brain transplant. His only option is a risky new procedure that his doctor recently perfected.,14

But as Murphy's law states,  ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong"", things did go downhill once again: stepped in the dog poop, got mugged and on top of that my wife left me for my stepbrother Timmy. I decided to go to a bar and maybe get a beer with the 5 dollars that somehow still had remained in my back pocket.

The bar was fully packed, even no seats left next to the counter. All of the sudden a hobo appears out of nowhere and asks if everything is okay. I tell him about my rough day, to which he said these words: ""Even in your low you can be high"".

Then she said “We need a new cuckoo clock.” When I asked her why, she said, “Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said “oh \*\*\*\*” Cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another three times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted.",Sneaking back in.,133

His name was Eddy and although we had different interests, we got along really well. Since I was good in science classes I often times helped him with his homework because for some reason he was only interested in history classes. Actually he was fascinated by them and it seemed that he grew almost obsessed with history. When I asked him, what is it that he likes so much in history, he just answered: ""History will repeat itself"". Left a bit puzzled by it, I didn't put too much thought into it.

As the years passed we both went to college - I ended up choosing physics as my major and as one would expect he chose history. After marrying Eddy got 3 wonderful children - a boy and two girls. Although Timmy, his son, had good grades, he still managed to get trouble every other week. Taking care of the children took more and more of his time, so we grew more distant each passing year.

By getting more salary from my job, I finally managed to buy a Tesla. Only two days after buying the car, it was stolen. I called the police, and they started an investigation. Once again two days had passed when I received a phone call from the local police station that my car has been caught by a traffic camera only two blocks away from my house and that the thief had been caught.

I immediately rushed to the station. After arriving there I was being led to the place where they held the thief.  My heart froze when I saw the face of the thief and all I could hear was the sentence all these years ago: ""History will repeat itself""

It was Eddy's son.

Next showed them pictures of a big and furious lion.

A third one had shot two gazelles.

The last hunter in their party bragged how he managed to shoot a nopliss.

They all went to bed and slept until next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Next evening they gathered and yet again, they shared their stories .

The first hunter had shot a crocodile. Next one had shot two lions. Third managed to shoot a hippo!

And the last one had shot not one, but two noplisses, they all nodded and went to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Third evening was approaching and the hunters gathered.

First hunter shot two zebras, second had shot three gazelles and the third had managed to shoot a buffalo and a hyena.

The forth hunter had shot nothing less than four noplisses!

At this point everyone was to confused of what noplisses were and finally one of them dared to ask the forth hunter:

""What the hell is a nopliss""?

He said ""can I siphon off enough to get me to the next gas station?"" I nodded and pulled the gas cap release button. He pulled out a rubber tube, unscrewed my cap and started sucking the end, to start the flow. Unfortunately he had a seizure mid suck, I saw him fall in my rear view mirror. I quickly opened the driver door and jumped out. He still had the tube in his mouth, I looked at him I wondered he was just unconscious or whether he had drowned or was poisoned by the gasoline. I looked down at him, but suddenly he leapt up, screamed and ran off at high speed down the road, so I got back in my car and drove off in pursuit, but struggled to keep up with him. I drove like this for about half an hour when he slowed down ran in to a lay by and collapsed again. I stopped the car and got out and ran up to him. I looked down at him, he opened his eyes and he looked much calmer. I said ""Man, when I saw you collapse just then I thought you were dead.""

This was his dream since he was young. Henry Hill was his role model. Arty had watched every mafia movie known to man, he was just waiting for the day to meet them and get in. 

One day Arty sees 4 mafia members sitting around a table. Arty was a scrawny dude, but he had balls. He went up to the table and said ""my name is Arty and I want to be in the mafia, I'll do whatever it takes""

They all looked at each other, then looked at Arty and started laughing. The  leader then said, ""alright kid, we'll give you a shot. But you have to prove yourself as a professional. We will pay you 1 dollar to kill 3 people, that dollar will be your formal invite into our group""

Arty was happy they gave him a shot, but he has never killed anyone before. He responds ""alright can I think about it?""

To which they say ""you will have till tomorrow morning to complete the task, if we see it in the headlines, then we will know you completed it, if not, it'll be as if we never met""

Arty say ok.

On his way home Arty stops at the grocery store to pick up some things. It's kinda late, so the store is mostly empty. As Arty is walking around , he sees a frail woman. He thinks to himself maybe this is my shot. So he takes it. He wraps his hands around her throat, she doesn't seem to be fighting back so he just squeezes until she dies. 

Arty doesn't think anyone saw so he just goes about his business shopping, however he notices another woman following him. He thinks she must have seen it, so he attacks. He grabs a cast iron skillet from the kitchen aisle and wacks her in the head. She hits the ground and starts bleeding, but she is still moving. Arty has to finish the job, so he sits on her chest and chokes her until she is no longer moving. 

At this point Arty has to get out of there. He heads to the exit but there is an employee there waiting for him. He knows he has to kill him and get out ASAP. So they start fighting, and it's dead even. Eventually Arty gets the upper hand and puts the employee in a headlock and just holds it until the guy is no longer breathing. He did it, he killed three people, now he just has to get home. 

As he exits the store, the police are already outside waiting for him, and Arty knows he's fucked up. He gets taken to jail, and the next day the headline reads...

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

  


On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

  


John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering,

The fly buckled up in the air a little and then flew off.  He then looked at his fellow musketeers and said, “Ha! That is proof that I’m the best with a sword!”

The other two musketeers were confused and said,  “but the fly flew off.  How does that make you the best one of us with a sword?”  

The third musketeer said, “That fly might have flown off, but he will never be able to reproduce anymore without a dick”

Recently, he met this girl  named Emma Wong and fell in love with her.  She is also a black Asian with the same last name.
  
To be honest, I’m kinda jealous.  Ever since he met her he stopped talking to me and if I try to talk to him, he instead turns to her and talks to her.  Considering Bill is my only friend because I am antisocial, I have been feeling more and more lonely.  So I kinda stopped talking to him and played on my Xbox and played some CSGO on steam.
  
About a year later he called to tell me that Emma is pregnant and he is very excited to have a child.  I said congrats dude.  I was genuinely excited for him because always wanted to start a family.
  
All the way during her pregnancy, Bill started talking to me more and more and we started connecting again and things were great.  About 9 months after the beginning of the pregnancy, she went into labor and Bill and Emma had already agreed to let me be in the delivery room.  
  
So there I was, in the delivery room watching Emma give birth to her and Bills baby, but something was wrong with it.  Considering the skin color of Bill and Emma, the baby looked surprisingly white.  After he was born, Bill was not very happy.  He started accusing Emma of cheating on him with a white guy and how he was mad at her and how he just wanted a child of his own.  Eventually the doctor walked back in and asked him what was wrong.  He said that the baby was white even though they were both black.  The doctor said “This is a huge misunderstanding, you see, though you two are black, two Wongs make a white.”",[OC]I have a black Asian friend named Bill Wong.,7

The father says to the talent agent, “Sir, our family has an amazing act, we know if you would let us perform it for you, you would want to sign us.” And the talent agent says, “Sorry, we don’t sign family acts, they’re too cutesy.” But then the mother goes, “Please sir, if you just give us two minutes I know you’ll like our act.” So the talent agent says “Alright, ya got two minutes.”

So the family jumps right into it. The mother smiles and points at the son who hits “play” on a boombox. Thrilling circus music starts to play as the father spins his daughter around, bends her over, lifts up her skirt, and starts licking her asshole. Then the son lays down on the floor and opens his mouth and the mother tears off tear-away pants, squats down over his face and starts shitting all over him. The father grabs the baby, takes off his diaper and starts sucking his cock. While the son, still with his mother’s shit in his mouth, goes over and licks the baby’s tiny little balls.

Now the mother lays down on the floor while the daughter gets up high on a chair and starts pissing all over her. Then the father and son take the baby and start stuffing it head-first back into the mother’s vagina, while the daughter’s piss rains down on all of them.

They get the baby halfway in, so that just its legs are sticking out all flailing around. The son takes the mother’s shit out of his mouth and starts rubbing it all over everyone, while the father sticks his cock in the baby’s asshole and fucks it while it’s still inside the mother, until he comes all over the baby, the wife, the son and the daughter.

Then the father gets up and says “And now for our impersonation of the victims of 9/11.” The whole family starts running around the room screaming and laughing with their dicks and titties all flapping around covered with shit and piss and cum going “Aaaaugh! Aaaugh! The building’s coming down! Help!”

And finally the family runs back to the center of the room and goes “TA-DAAAA!!”

And the talent agent he just sits there for the longest time, and finally he says, “Jesus, that’s a hell of an act. What do you call it?”

And the father says, “The Aristocrats!”","This is South Parks take on ""The Aristocrats"" joke",1

 They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose.   
 

They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.   
 

The two guys objected strongly. ""Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours.""   
 

Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off. However, while attempting to cross some mountains, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.
