It's Sunday and the donut says to himself...""You know what I think I'm going to take the day off and go enjoy myself.""  The Donut hasn't taken time off in about 3 months so he decides that he's going to go spend the day down at the local pier.  

So he goes to the pier and starts rolling around or whatever donuts do.  He's at the pier for several hours before a man walks up to him and says ""Hey you know I've seen you rolling around here for a while, do you need help with something?""  The donut replies to the man ""It's my birthday today and I'm not sure what I want to do.""  The man laughs and says to the donut ""you know I heard there's a cruise ship pulling out of here in a couple hours...if you make it down to the travel agency I'm sure you can grab a ticket and have yourself a few days to relax!""  The donut replies ""you know what?  That's a great idea, I think I'll do just that...yeah I could use a few days off from work.""  The donut quickly runs back home packs his bags and gets a ticket from the travel agency and boards the cruise ship ecstatic for his journey.

""Wow, this is amazing!"" the donut says.  The donut's having a great time on the cruise, he's rolling around the decks, tanning in the sun, sprinkles blowing in the wind...whatever it is donuts do to have fun.  So the donut gets this great idea all of a sudden...""gee it's my birthday today, I think I'll ask the captain if he'll let me drive the ship...after all it is my birthday! That's not a bad idea, why not?!""  

So the donut goes up to the bridge and says ""Captain Captain it's my birthday today can you please let me drive the ship.""  The Captain says ""No get the fuck out of here!"" and he kicks the donut out.  

The donut looks confused and goes back to his cabin for a bit...then he says to himself ""you know what?  I bet the Captain was just really busy when I went up there, I'll just go up there and ask him again.  He definitely won't turn me down this time!""  So the donut goes back up to the bridge again and says to the Captain ""Captain Captain can you please let me drive the boat, it's my birthday today I'd love to drive the boat!""  The Captain says ""No, get the fuck out of here, if you come up here again I'll have you thrown overboard!""  

Again, the donut looks disappointed and returns to his cabin and takes a nap for a few hours.  He wakes up and says to himself ""You know, the Captain must have been really busy earlier!  If I go back up there now and ask to drive the boat there's no way he'll turn me down!  He just can't!""  The donut rolls off eager as always and makes his way to the bridge.  He rolls into the bridge and says ""Captain Captain will you please let me drive the boat?""

So a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, he's absolutely in love with this girl so he's got the perfect proposal planned.  He takes her out to this bluff overlooking the ocean.  It's a beautiful sunny day.  The man set up a picnic and the two are jamming out to music on his iphone...everything is going perfect.  

So he finally feels like it's time to propose...he bought her the most expensive beautiful ring that he hand picked at the jewelry store.  He spent his entire life savings on this ring.  He reaches out into his back pocket and as he goes to get down on one knee to propose he slips and drops the ring over the bluff into the water...gone forever.  His whole life savings wasted away.  His girlfriend looks at him and says ""You know what, I love you and I want to marry you anyway.  I know it'll be hard but we can make it work!""  

So a couple weeks pass by and the couple have been having to work long hours to pay their bills.  They decide that they should go out for a nice expensive date to relax from all the extra work they've been doing to make up for the ring he bought.  The man takes his fiance out to a nice expensive seafood restauraunt and he orders himself a nice lobster and she orders a plate of hot steamy oysters.  Just as his fiance opens the first oyster she screams and drops it on the table.  The mans eyes are wide open in shock at what's inside...

This is a great joke to tell your friends.  It's especially great if you want to get someone in particular since this joke can be told in two parts, the donut part and the proposal part.  I've even spanned this joke out over several days...or just as little as ten minutes.  But when you finish telling the joke to whoever they usually say ""the ring"" and look like and idiot when you tell them the real answer.  The longer you let this joke ride the better the laugh, since your friends are usually pissed off after the donut gets thrown in the water.

As he runs to the nearest restrooms, and he finds the men's room is in use and he can't wait any longer. Reluctantly, he finds the women's restroom to be available and runs in.

In the women's room, the man is shocked to see a panel of buttons on the toilet stall wall. Overcome by curiosity, the man inspects the buttons closer. The first is labeled ""CW""... seeing no harm, he presses it and much to his delight he is sprayed with cold water, and so he understands why it's labeled CW. It feels nice, so he makes his way down to the next button.

The next button reads ""WW"". Hoping for the best, he presses the button and his ass is greeted with warm water; ahh yes, WW, warm water. This feels even nicer and he's delighted to move down the list.

The next button is labeled ""WA"", which he excitedly presses and is dried off with some warm air. He's elated by this fancy toilet and takes a moment to enjoy this experience before pressing the final button.

The last button, labeled ""ATR"" beckons him to press it. Each previous button was an increasingly nice experience, so he's expecting ATR to be even better. Giddy with joy, he smiles and presses the ATR button. Suddenly, the man feels immense pain and then passes out.

The man wakes up a few hours later in a hospital, confused and very numb from the pain meds. He finds a nurse and begs to know what happened. The nurse explains, ""you were found passed out in the women's restroom."" The man explains how the men's room was in use so he had to use the women's.

The nurse asks him, ""while in the women's restroom, you pressed the ATR button, didn't you?"" The man nods while displaying a look of confusion. The nurse looks back at him and says, ""ATR stands for automatic tampon remover. Your penis in under your pillow.""",Fancy Women's Restroom,3

The squirrel looks up to him and says in her squirrely voice ""That's a good question, I don't know.""

The dalmatian then approaches his friend the cat and asks him the same question: ""Cat, am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" The cat responds, ""Beats me"" and walks away.

The dalmatian is walking down the street contemplating his conundrum and is wondering if there is anyone else he can ask, when BAM he gets hit by a truck and dies. He goes to Doggy Heaven and is greeted by Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. Peter welcomes the dog to Heaven and gives him a quick overview of the place. He finishes and asks if Dalmatian has any questions. ""Yes!"" the dalmatian said excitedly. ""This question has been bothering me for the longest time and I need to know. Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?""

Saint Peter quizzically looks up as he thinks, then shakes his head as he replies, ""I don't know. BUT, what you can do is go in and ask the big guy yourself. Go down this hall and he's at the very last door.""

""Wow thanks!"" says Dalmatian. He gets to the last room, knocks and enters. God asks how he can help. The dalmatian timidly asks his question: ""Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" Without missing a beat, God responds in a booming voice, ""You are what you are."" Satisfied, the dog leaves.

Upon exiting, Saint Peter asks, ""Well, did you get your answer?""

- There's a job advertised here. Graveyard shift. 
- I have a friend who works here. Says it's a bit of a dead end job.

Well, I’m retired and always on the lookout for fun, so I told her I didn’t actually have a dog, but I was starting on the “Happy Dog” diet again. 

“It’s really simple” I said. “You just keep your pockets full of Happy Dog chunks, and every time you feel your stomach rumble you just pop a couple in your mouth. It’s nutritionally complete, has lots of fiber, and last time I lost 25 pounds.” 

A few more people had stopped and were listening by this time, and they all seemed mesmerized. When you live long enough to be retired, you realize people will believe anything if you make it interesting. 

So I really cranked it up and said, “Even though it worked great and I lost weight, I’m not sure it’s a good idea, because last time I wound up in intensive care.” 

The woman opened her eyes wide and asked, “Were you poisoned by the dog food?”

""Not on your life,"" cries the other, ""He will marry my daughter!"". After bickering for a while, the two mothers decide to go the rabbi and ask him to resolve the situation. In the grand tradition of the ancients, the rabbi replies, ""Well, there is only one solution to this problem. Cut the boy in half, and you each take half home with you.""

At this, the first mother says ""Yes, cut him in half!"", but the second mother refuses - ""Don't hurt him!"". The rabbi combs his beard, ponders the situation and says to the first mother, ""You, who wanted to cut him in half, YOU are the real mother-in-law"".",Wisdom of the Ancients,14

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a 'New Wives' store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have money and like football

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",A store that sells new husbands has opened in London.,227

So he picks up the phone and phoned to the vet in order to find a solution. The vet says: ""alright no problem, you have to do an artificial insemination and everything will be alright"", the guy had no clue about what artificial insemination was, so he decided to don't look stupid and said:""yes yes no problem, but how can I understand if this artificial insemination worked fine?"" the vet replies back ""Well the day after the insemination open up the windows and look for the sheeps, if the sheeps are laying on the ground without moving too much it means that the process has worked fine, otherwise you have to repeat the operation again"". So the guy, who was not an expert and a bit ignorant, decided that the best way to make this operation was to fuck all the sheeps by himself. So he picked up his big van, load all the sheeps in it and take them to the forest were he fucked all the sheeps once, he went back at night and went to bed for a good sleep. The morning after he shout to his wife: ""Maria! Open up the window and tell me were the sheeps are!"", Maria replies: ""well...they are standing...eating grass...playing around!"" they guys says:""Damn! it didn't work!""
So he picked up his van and loaded all the sheep again to take them to the wood were he fucked all the sheep twice, back to home very very tired and went to bed for a sleep...
They day after when he woke up he shout to his wife: ""Maria! open up the window and tell me how the sheeps are!"", Maria replies back:""Well..the sheeps are standing...playing around and eating grass!"" So the guy pick up the van again, load all the sheeps up and he went to the wood were he spent all day long fucking sheeps all day long. He went back home veeery very tired, went to bed and fall in a deep sleep...the day after he woke up and and ask to his wife:""Maria! Open the window and tell me how the sheeps are!"", Maria as usual open up the windows and say after a pause :""well..there are no sheeps anymore.....ah no...hang on...they are all on the van and one of them is honking the horn!!""",Italian Joke [Forgive my English],2

She said, “If you can catch me, you can

another woman clad in a bikini who said, “If
you catch me, you can sleep with me.”

catch the woman. So, he thought this was an

The friars would bring flowers of all colors and sizes from their monastery to sell to the public, placing all profits into a fund for the poor. The friars sold flowers for very low prices, lower than all competitors in their area, and as a result a sort of coalition of other local flower shops formed to undercut the friars and put them out of business. 

No matter how hard they tried, the other local florists could not drive the friars out of business. Sales, specials, and price cuts could not stem the friars' business, so they used their connections and hired a man named Bruce from out of state to strong arm the friars into closing up shop. 

Bruce showed up at the friars' shop just before closing time, kicking in the door, destroying plants and pots, overturning tables and stands. Then, he told the friars that they were permanently out of business, and if he ever heard that they were selling flowers again, he would kill them. 

Bruce said, ""Remember that Bruce told you to make like a tree and leave,"" and the friars did so. 

The coalition of florists was thrilled that their businesses would become more profitable. The friars were interviewed by a local newspaper and told the reporter every detail about their harrowing encounter.

At night, their bedroom was The Song Of Solomon and their partings were a Shakespearean sonnet. 

One day the Englishman asked for his love's hand in marriage. However, this Frenchwoman held tradition as close to her heart as she did her lover, so one evening, after giving the Englishman Syphilis, the Frenchwoman and the Englishman stood before The Frenchwoman's father. Boldly, the Englishman asked his love's father for his daughter's hand in marriage. The father looked at the Englishman, his face twisted with scorn and said, ""**NON** My daughter shall marry only a proper Frenchman!"" As the Frenchwoman collapsed in her grief, the English man swore that he would not surrender so easily.

The next day, the Englishman went to his physician and made a mad request. ""Doctor"" he said, ""I find myself loving a woman as no man, since the beginning of CREATION! has loved another, and I am in dire need of your assistance. For you see I am maddened by my love of a fair French goddess!"" The doctor clutched chest as he let out a gasp and exclaimed, ""A Frenchwoman! Surely you are mad!"" The Englishman then shouted, ""MOCK LOVE NOT, PHYSICIAN! For you must know I intend to wed this fairest of maidens, but to my dismay, her father will not allow a blessed union to take place unless... I am a Frenchman! So my request to you, learned man of the medical arts, is for you to transform me... into a Frenchman!"" The physician sat somberly on his stool as he lit a pipe filled with the finest of tobaccos. Idly puffing on his tobacco, he lifted his eyes and said, ""I know of a procedure, however it comes with... considerable risk."" The Englishman stood up and shouted, ""RISK IS OF NO CONCERN TO ME, FOR THIS IS LOVE WE SPEAK OF!"" the physician then put out his hand and said, ""Charles, steady on."" The Englishman composed himself and listened intently to the physicians words. ""You see my dear sir, I can perform a surgery to mold you into the perfect Frenchman, however I must remove five percent... of your brain!"" Without a moments hesitation the Englishman agreed and he was wheeled into surgery.

The surgery was performed and the Englishman survived the cutting, snipping, and pulling. Some hours later the Englishman awoke from his narcotics induced stupor. Upon waking the physician rushed into the room and exclaimed, ""MY dear sir, there has been the most terrible of errors, for you see we did extract a mere five percent... we removed fifty percent!"" The English then looked at the physician, flashed a carefree smile and said, ""Crikey! It salright mate!

They stared and stared, wondering where they had seen him before, when suddenly the Irishman cried out, ""My God, I know who that man is. It's Jesus!"" 

The others looked again and, sure enough, it was Jesus himself,sitting alone at a table. The Irishman call out, ""Hey!, you!!! Are you Jesus?"" The man looks over at him, smiles a small smile and nods his head. ""Yes, I am Jesus"" he says. 

The Irishman calls the bartender over and says to him ""I'd like you to give Jesus over there a pint of Guinness from me."" So the bartender pours Jesus a Guinness and takes it over to his table. Jesus looks over,raises his glass, smiles thank you and drinks. 

The Englishman then calls out, ""Errr, excuse me Sir, but would you be Jesus?"" 

Jesus smiles and says, ""Yes, I am Jesus."" 

The Englishman beckons the bartender and tells him to send over a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale for Jesus, which the bartender duly does. As before, Jesus accepts the drink and smiles over at the men. 

Then the Australian calls out, ""Oi, you! D'ya reckon you're Jesus, do ya?"" Jesus nods and says, ""Yes, I am Jesus."" 

The Australian is mighty impressed and has the bartender send over a pot of VB for Jesus, which he accepts with pleasure. 

Some time later, after finishing the drinks, Jesus le! aves his seat and approaches the three men. He reaches for the hand of the Irishman and shakes it, thanking him for the Guinness. When he lets go, the Irishman gives a cry of amazement. ""Oh God, the arthritis is gone,"" he says. The arthritis I've had for years is gone. It's a miracle!"" 

Jesus then shakes the hand of the Englishman, thanking him for the Newcastle Brown Ale. Upon letting go, the Englishman's eyes widen in shock. ""By Jove"", he exclaims,"" The migraine I've had for over 40 years is completely gone. It's a Miracle!""

They enter the room, sit down, and the IRS agent starts to question them.

&gt;IRS Agent: **""Well, sir, we think it is a little odd that you have no official income, but are able to afford such a lavish lifestyle, and you claim it is all from Gambling? You say you made $300,000 last year from gambling alone?""**

&gt;Grandpa: **""Yes. I am very good at it. Would you like a demonstration? I will bet you $1,500 that I can bite my own eye.""**

The IRS agent stares at him for a minute, quite confused, and takes the bet. Before he can retract his words, Grandpa pops out his glass eye and proceeds to bite it. The IRS agent is stunned, and just lost a grand.

&gt;Grandpa: **""You didn't think I could do it did you? Tell you what, double or nothing, I can bite my other eye.""**

The IRS agent studies Grandpa for a minute and thinks to himself that there is no way this guy has two glass eyes, and takes the bet. Grandpa pulls out his dentures and uses them to bite his other eye. The IRS agent's mount drops. He is out $3000 now fair and square, with this man's lawyer here as proof, and starting to get worried.

&gt;Grandpa (laughs): **""You look worried, son. I will do one more bet, double or nothing. I am going to stand here and pee into that waste can behind you and not spill a single drop anywhere else.""**

The IRS agent looks at the man, turns around and looks at the waste can. It is about 6 feet behind him. This old man will have to pee about 8-9 feet and not spill a single drop. The IRS agent is worried, but he thinks he can win this bet.

&gt;IRS Agent: **""You're on!""**

Grandpa stands up and unzips. He struggles mightily and lets a weak stream go. It doesn't get anywhere near the trash can. In fact, it just splashes all over the IRS agents desk and runs onto the floor. The IRS agent starts jumping up and down with a huge smile on his face.

&gt;IRS Agent: **""HAHA! YES! You didn't even get close!""**

The lawyer puts his head in his hands at this point, shaking it slowly, clearly upset about the incident. The IRS agent looks over at him and asks what is wrong.

&gt;Lawyer: **""Just before we came in here, Grandpa bet me $25,000 that he could piss on your desk today and you would be happy about it.""**

Jack is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in Lipstick:

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian""

He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, ""Son... What happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??""

His son replies, ""Oh THAT! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, ""Leave me alone, I'm married!!""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

 Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep. The next day I took off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big department store. I walked around with her as she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so I said, ""Lets get a pair for each outfit."" We went on to the jewelry counter where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. She was so excited. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet.

 I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey."" She was nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, ""I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier."" 

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No baby, I don't feel like it."" Her face went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?"" I said, ""Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

Spouts out a long narration?

And doesn’t take input, of course

Someone and have temptation

And ordering some shellfish

The war-weary marine asked, ""Ma'am, may I have that seat?""

The French woman sniffed and said to nobody in particular, ""Americans are so rude. My little Fifi is using that seat.""

The marine walked the entire length of the train again, but the only seat he found was underneath the dog. ""Please, Ma'am. May I sit down? I am very tired,"" he asked again.

She snorted, ""Not only are you Americans rude, but you are also arrogant!""

This time the marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window, and sat down.

The woman shrieked, ""Someone must defend my honor! Put this American in his place!""

An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up. ""Sir, you Americans seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You hold the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you seem to have thrown the wrong bitch out the window""

Edit: words and stuff",A marine boarded a train on his way home from deployment,22

The next day he brought the drawing back to school and showed it to the teacher, the teacher looked at it and told him to leave the class and go to the principal. At the principal's office the boy was asked why he was sent, the boy responded;

""Well I was told to draw a blue fish but as soon as the teacher saw it she sent me to you.""
The principal asked to see the drawing and upon viewing it expelled the student from the school.

On his way home the boy met his dad, curiously the dad asked him;

""Aren't you supposed to be in school?"" To which the boy responded;

""I got expelled for drawing a blue fish"" The dad demanded to see the drawing and upon looking at him disowned him as a son and told him to go home.

The boy reached home and his mother, confused, asked why he was at home. To which the boy narrated the whole blue fish story. The mother asked for the drawing and then kicked him out of the house.

The boy then went to his brother who lived alone and asked to live with him, the brother asked him why? And the boy repeated the story of the blue fish. The brother saw the drawing and threw him out of the house.

Having no other option the boy made his way to his grandfather's house but while crossing the road he got hit by a car and died on the spot. So ladies and gentlemen what is the moral of the story?

""What the hell is this apple for?"" says the man. ""Just try it, you'll be amazed."" Says the other man. He takes a bite and is struck with amazement. ""Holy hell, this tastes exactly like tequila!"" The other man says ""Now turn it around!"" the man turns the apple around and takes another bite. ""Amazing.. This tastes just like cranberry!"" A third man walks in the bar and the sees the apples on the table. The first man tells the third man that anything he wants, the bartender will pull out an apple that will taste just like it. So the third man thinks for a second... ""You know what bartender, give me an apple that tastes like pussy."" Bartender reaches under the table and pulls out an apple. The man looks at it with skepticism, then bites into the apple. ""Man this tastes like shit!!"" Bartender says ""No, TURN IT AROUND""

So the man agreed and made his first wish. ""I want lots of money"", he said. Instantly 22 million dollars appeared in the man's bank account and 44 million appeared in his boss' account.

For his second wish, the man wished for a couple of sports cars. Instantly a Lamborghini, Ferrari and Porsche appeared. At the same time two of each car appeared outside of his boss' house.

Finally the genie said, ""This is your last wish, you should choose carefully,"" and to this the man replied, ""I've always wanted to donate a kidney...""",A genie gives a man three wishes...,400

Not quite sure how to approach her, he called the family Doctor to discuss the problem. 
The Doctor told him there is a simple informal test the husband could perform to give the Doctor a better idea about her hearing loss.
'Here's what you do,' said the Doctor. 'Stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response.'
That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den.  He says to himself, 'I'm about 40 feet away. Let's see what happens.'  Then in a normal tone he asks, 'Honey, what's for dinner?'
No response.
So the husband moves closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, 'Peg, what's for dinner?'
Still no response.
Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, 'Honey, what's for dinner?'
Again he gets no response.
So, he walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. 'Honey, what's for dinner?' 
Again there is no response.
 So he walks right up behind her. 'Peg, what's for dinner?'
'For Pete's sake, Bert, for the FIFTH time, CHICKEN!'

So, he ran an ad to find some sea gulls - - someone with a few sea gulls answered that ad...

The guy went to buy the sea gulls, but he was told the sea gulls were only a few days old and were still too young to move... the guy promised he would be very careful with them... he bought them and drive home with the sea gulls in his car...

When he arrived home, he walked to the front door and saw two fully grown lions sleeping right at the front door and blocking the entrance...

The guy wasn't sure what to do, so he decided to unlock and open the door very carefully and quietly so he wouldn't disturb the sleeping lions, and then he stepped over them to enter into his house...

As soon as the guy entered his home, the FBI arrested him..
He was charged with transporting under age gulls across sedate lions for illegal porpoises...",Pity the poor porpoises,19
