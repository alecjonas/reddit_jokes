As the next hand is drawn, the man is starting to feel nervous. He notices deaths scythe propped against the wall and as death lifts his cards to look, he can see their full reflection in the scythe. 

He starts winning, hand by hand, folding some, winning others, losing a few in between so death doesn't cotton on to his method. 

Slowly, but surely, he's got death by the balls, a couple more hands and he's won.

""You know, I don't know how you've done it"", says Death, ""but you're actually going to beat me"". 

*Not this hand*, thinks the man. He's seen Death has a pair of Kings and he's going to have to fold and wait for the next one.

They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. ""This is your house now, here are your keys.""
The man is happy and thanks the devil. The devil says:""No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!""

They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. ""These are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?"".

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.
They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?""
The devil just shrugs and says: ""Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that way""


edit: fucked up punchline, thanks to u/Tjurit for pointing out",An atheist dies and goes to hell.,35686

As they were waiting for their companion to find his ball that went into the rough, the other 3 started talking about their sons. 

The first man said ""My son's been doing pretty good lately. He was never too studious but he was always a people person and had the gift of being able to sell stuff. He's been the top BMW salesman in the area for the past 5 years and finally became co-owner of the dealership. He's been doing so good that the other day he was able to give his best friend a brand new car!""

The second man nodded and started describing his son. ""Well my son was always really good at math and drawing growing up, so he ended up going to school for architecture. He started up a small construction firm with some friends after they graduated and within the past 5 years it's really blown up. Even with the housing market being somewhat down they've managed to get bigger and bigger every year. In fact, this past year they were so successful that my son was able to build a house that he gave to his best friend for free!""

The third man looked impressed and began to talk about his son.""Well my son was never really smart and has never managed to hold down a job for longer than 6 months. Fortunately for my wife and I, he's somehow the luckiest dumbass on the planet. When he was younger he'd always end up winning a few thousand dollars at the casino every few months, so we would never really have to help him out financially. Then he ended up winning that Powerball jackpot a few months back, which ended up being $48 million dollars after taxes! He's got so much money now he just gives us all kinds of expensive gifts whenever we see him. In fact, hes got so much money he gave his best friend $1 million dollars!""

A ball sailed out of the rough, landing near the three men, and the fourth man finally emerged from the tall grass, never finding his ball. The first man said ""Hey, how has your son been doing?"" The fourth man sighed and reluctantly started talking. ""Well, it's been kind of a sensitive topic over the years, but it's gotten better as of late. Now me, I could care less but my wife is really religious and not too forward thinking. So as you can imagine, it was really hard when our son came out as gay to us 5 years ago. Anyway, it's been tough but he's happy, so that's all I care about. In fact, he's got these three boyfriends that are always doing pretty great stuff for him. One gave him a BMW, one built him a house, and the other gave him $1 million dollars!""",Four guys out golfing and talking about their sons.,68

Reed's girlfriend looks at him, very flirtatiously. He looks away. Steve picks up the sandwiches he ordered, and the family walks back into the car.

Thirteen minutes have passed while Steve is at the wheel. Reed's girlfriend decides to slip his hand into her pants. Her lips rush across her face, and Reed flashes her a look of excitement. *She's warm,* he thinks.

Roles reverse as her hand slips into his pants, freeing the bone that was lodged inside his pants. She strokes him, very sneakily, as if it were a game of ""hide from the parents.""

Reed looks forward. A straight face maintained, he groans softly as her hand cusps the head. He feels moisture as his dick enters her mouth. He continues to look forward.

Wet, soft, occasional gagging noises rested in the back as the car paced along the highway. Her soft tongue rushed across the shaft. Reed is close to climax. Her mouth is bobbing furiously in his pants, and liquids are felt rushing out. A split second passes before Reed's tip explodes.

Steve was ignorant of the entire situation, focusing on the map. Laurene was intently watching, hand in crotch, trying not to stifle a groan.

Confused by the map, Steve asks Reed, ""Come and look at this.""

Reed quickly reacts. ""We're on the I-15, heading through Arizona. Right... here,"" he points at the map.

But he followed his command to the last literal word.

A rest stop pulls up, and Steve sets the car in park. He takes a bite out of his house special sandwich and says, ""This sauce is delicious!""

Laurene says to him, ""Oh, honey, that's **not** special sauce. Well... I guess it's... *Reed's* special sauce.""

Steve wakes up in his room. It was all a nightmare. Just a bad nightmare. Those events did not happen. He sat there and laughed to himself, thinking about how messed up his dream was.

Never again.

Never again will he dream of driving something that has Windows.","Steve Jobs finishes his work as CEO of the day, goes home, and tucks into bed.

As they were walking, they heard a squeal and saw a small furry creature falling down the mountain, tumbling past them before rolling to a stop.

""Good islander, what kind of animal is that?"" he asked. 

""That's what we here in the village call a Trid,"" the islander explained. 

""What a truly fascinating creature. Do they normally come tumbling into the village like that?""

The islander sighed. ""Unfortunately, yes. You see, at the top of this mountain there is a thriving population of Trids. For years they lived peacefully, until a terrible ogre came along. This ogre finds no greater delight than when he sends Trids tumbling down the mountainside.""

The Jewish man was shocked. Such cruelty simply could not be tolerated. ""I will go to this ogre and speak with him. It's only right that someone should try to help such innocent creatures.""

""You can try,"" the islander said, ""but nothing you say will be able to help the Trids.""

The Jewish man ignored him and journeyed up the mountain. Three times on his way up, the Jewish man saw helpless Trids being callously tossed over the mountainside and tumbling to the coast below. As he reached the summit, a terrible ogre came lumbered into view. The Trids around the mountaintop scattered, but not quickly enough. The ogre reached down and snatched a Trid from the ground,  tossing it into the air before viciously kicking it over the mountain. The Jewish man looked on in disbelief before working up the courage to confront the terrible beast. 

""Ogre,"" he called, ""I am a traveler and a leader within my faith. I've come to ask you why you harm these creatures with such vicious acts.""

The ogre turned, sneering at the man with a horrible grin of mismatched teeth. ""You come to question me, man?"" the beast snarled. ""I care not for the feelings of these Trids. My only joy is kicking them over the mountain and watching them climb back up.""

The Jewish man knew that such a malicious ogre could never be convinced to live peacefully with the Trids. ""Very well then. If your only joy is in harming others, then I will offer myself in place of these creatures. Kick me over the mountain and leave the Trids alone.""

The ogre threw back its head and let loose horrendous peals of laughter. ""I cannot kick you over the mountain, man. You cannot replace these creatures.""

The Jewish man knew there was nothing he could do. Despair washed over him and he asked, ""Why?""

The ogre turned to him, leaning down until it's terrible visage was mere inches away from his face. It's rancid breath washed over the man as it said, 

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids.""",A Jewish man traveled to a small mountain island,18

The Pope: ""But I am the leader of the Catholic Church ...""

St. Peter walks away through Heaven's Gate to talk with God.

St. Peter: ""There's a dude standing outside who claims he's your representative on earth.""

God: ""I don't have a representative on earth, not that I know of ... Wait, I'll ask Jesus."" (yells for Jesus)

Jesus: ""Yes father, what's up?""

God and St. Peter explain the situation.

Jesus: ""Wait, I'll go outside and have a little chat with that fellow.""

Ten minutes pass and Jesus reenters the room laughing out loud. After a few minutes St. Peter asks Jesus why he's laughing.

Jesus: ""Remember that fishing club I've started 2000 years ago? It still exists!""",The pope dies and arrives in heaven,34

Curious, the scientists went to go observe the crows. The birds would take nuts, and drop them in the road, for vehicles to run over, and crack open. They would then eat the exposed nuts, and a lookout bird would signal when a car approached and the other birds would fly out of the street.

He went out and bought a red convertible sports car.  While driving his new car on the highway he decided to speed up and have some fun.  Sure enough he heard the siren and saw the flashing lights behind him.  In a panic he pushed the gas to the floor and started pulling away starting a proper police chase.  After a minute of heart pumping speed, he realized just how dumb that was and he pulled over while the cop caught up.

The cop gets out of his car and does that cocky cop trot we all know.  At the guys window the cop stares at him with a mean look.  Not knowing if he was going to get a ticket or be thrown in jail for running away the guy rolled down his window and starts apologizing.  

The cop stops him and says “ I have been a police officer doing traffic for 20 years. Today is my last day on the job and the last thing I wanna do is haul your dumbass off to jail ruining the rest of my day.  I’m gonna give you one chance to get out of this. Doing traffic for 20 years I have heard every excuse in the book. If you can come up with a convincing reason why you just sped off like that, I’ll let you go. If not you’re going to straight to jail.”

The man thinks for a moment, then looks the cop directly in the eyes and says “Sir, three weeks ago my wife left me for a police officer. I just thought you were trying to give her back. “

The cop puts his pen is his shirt and says “Sir you have a great day.”",Midlife crisis,36

post,84zjj1,2qh72,jokes,false,1521240483,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/84zjj1/funny_little_story/,self.jokes,,"A cowboy named Billy was overseeing his herd in a remote pasture in eastern Oregon when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust. 

The driver, a young man in a Brioni® suit, Gucci® shoes, RayBan® sunglasses and YSL® tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?"" 

Billy looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell® notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3® cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop® and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot® that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL® database through an ODBC connected Excel® spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry® and, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet® printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves."" 

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Billy. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Billy says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?"" 

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?"" 

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Billy. 

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?"" 

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

Veronica broke up with her last boyfriend a year ago and she’s been down on her luck sexually. Her friend has been urging her to guy to the sex shop down the road and take care of herself. ;)

Veronica says “fuck it” and pays the ol’ adukt shop a visit. 

“Hello there! How can we help you?!” Asks the clerk. 

“I’m just looking for something to get me by. I’ve been...single awhile.” Veronica replies shyly. 

“Oh!” exclaims the clerk “We just got a new top of the line item in that just might make you forget about men.”

“Okay, what is it?” Veronica asks.

“It’s called the magic lover. It’s a very special dildo that is very advanced. All you have to do is say ‘Dildo my- and then whatever you want it to work on.” The clerk gives a sly wink.

Veronica buys it and is off to home.
On the way, she gets curious how exactly it works. She says “Dildo my vagina.” 

Suddenly, the dildo pops out of the box, hops over, works it’s way into her pants and goes to town. 

Veronica is swerving left and right on the road and has no idea how to shut this thing off. A couple of minutes in, she is pulled over by a police officer.

The officer walks up to the window as she tries desperately to hold her composure.

“Ma’am, is there a good reason you’re swerving today?”

Veronica reluctantly replies “because of a dildo.”

The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.

You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.

So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the ""greatest con ever botched,"" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the ""condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending"" con.","The swindler was headed upstairs to visit his friend, the forger...",6

The husband shouted , ""I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."" 

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. 

A warm voice said, ""Come on in."" When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window. 

A man reclining on the couch asked, ""Are you the people that broke my window?"" 

""Uh...yeah, sir. We're sure sorry about that,"" the husband replied. 

""Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a ghost, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll Give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for myself."" 

""Wow, that's great!"" the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, ""I'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life.""

""No problem,"" said the ghost. ""You've got it, it's the least I can do. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"" 

""And now you, young lady, what do you want?"" the ghost asked. ""I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world,"" she said. 

""Consider it done,"" the ghost said. ""And your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"" 

""And now,"" the couple asked in unison, ""what's your wish, ghost?"" 

""Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."" 

The husband looked at his wife and said, ""honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?"" 

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, ""You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"" 

""You know I love you sweetheart,"" said the husband. 

""I'd do the same for you!"" So the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. The ghost was insatiable. 

After about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost looked directly into her eyes and asked, ""How old are you and your husband?"" 

""Why, we're both 35,"" she responded breathlessly.

After walking for a few hours he pauses at a park bench and sits down to collect his thoughts. 

A crow lands on the bench beside him and takes him off guard by saying hello.

“Are... are you a talking crow?!” OP asks with great shock. 

“Sure am, my name is Charlie.” The crow responds enthusiastically. “Nice weather huh?”

OP, amazed by this amazing discovery, begins a conversation with the crow. He asks everything a human would want to know about crows and crow culture. After a while however, it seems like OP and the crow have little left to talk about. 

OP, wanting to impress the crow, asks him if he’d like to hear a few jokes. The crow nods its head in agreement and OP thinks of the funniest jokes from his favourite sub, r/jokes. 


The first joke he tells is an ageless classic, Dave and The Pope. 

The crow loves it. He Caws and squawks in laughter. 

“That’s a good one.” Says the crow, however I have a better one.”  

OP is amazed that crow manages to make him laugh harder than he made the crow laugh. Not one to be one-upped, he tells another ageless classic, the bus driver and the nun. 

Again, the crow caws and squawks in laughter, and manages to tell an even funnier joke than a first. 

Frustrated, OP racks his brain to find the funniest joke he could remember, and after a few moments of deciding, he decides to tell the tale of the little boy and his baseball mitt. 

The crow manages to out do him again! Frustrated, OP cries out in embarrassment 

“How?! How do you know a funnier joke every time?!”

“Well.” Says the crow... ",OP meets a talking crow,75

post,84vh08,2qh72,jokes,false,1521207546,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/84vh08/voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.

\""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …\"" said the old man, and then he stopped.

\""Except what?\"" asked the businessman.

\""Nothing, nothing,\"" said the old man.

\""C'mon, tell me! I need something!\"" protested the businessman.

\""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'\"" the old man said.

\""So what's up with this voodoo dick?\"" the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, \""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\""

The old man said, \""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\""

He pointed to a door and said \""Voodoo dick, the door.\""

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, \""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\""

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

The businessman said, \""I'll take it!\""

The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \""Voodoo dick, my pussy.\""

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \""Voodoo dick, my pussy!\"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, \""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!\""",Voodoo dick,12

She lost her job at the dance company and thus her insurance, leaving her with a shattered knee and broken dreams.

Then she saw a commercial for these brand new knee replacements, Mah Knees.  They were supposed to be better than the knees you were even born with.

So she reached out to the company and explained her situation.  She couldn't afford the knees but she had gained some fame and wondered if a deal could be made.  

Mr. Mah heard about her story and reached out with a proposition. He wanted to really show off what his knees could do so he told Lacey, "" I'll give you the replacement knee and operation for free but then you have to work for me creating dance moves to show of just how good our knees can be.""  

Lacey gladly accepted and thanked Mr. Mah profusely.  When she was signing her employment contract the legal team warned her that Mr. Mah took his branding very seriously, so she could no longer describe what she did just as dance she had to use the proper copyrighted phrase, even in personal conversation.

So she signed and a year later she was at a company gala where she saw an old friend she hasn't in years.  She said hi and they exchanged pleasantries, and the friend wanted to introduce Lacey to his wife.  He said "" Honey, this is my old friend Lacey, she dances.""

Lacey always being careful about violating her contract corrected her friend, ""I don't dance now, I make Mah Knee moves.""",A young kid from the inner city only ever dreamed of being a dancer,5

“The car is parked on the street in front of the bank,” says Mr Singh, “and I have all the necessary papers.”

One of the employees drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, Mr Singh returns, repays the £5000 and the interest, which comes to £15.41.

The loan officer says, ""Sir, I must tell you, we’re all a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and discovered that you’re a multimillionaire. Why would you bother to borrow £5,000?""

'If my husband catches us in here, he'll kill us both!' she replied. 'He's got a hot temper and a gun, so the rain is the least of your problems.'

So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he ran down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovered he had run right into the middle of the town's annual marathon, so he started running along beside the others, about 300 of them.

Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tried to blend in as best he could. After a little while a small group of runners who had been watching him with some curiosity, jogged closer. Do you always run in the nude?' one asked.

'Oh yes!' he replied, gasping in air. 'It feels so wonderfully free!'
Another runner moved along side. 'Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?'
'Oh, yes' our friend answered breathlessly. 'That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home.'

Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and asked,

'Do you always wear a condom when you run?'


'Nope. Just when it's raining!''

He looks at her blankly...

=

""New here aren't you?"" she says, ""Any popular website where you can earn karma can be used as currency.""

=

""Awesome"", thinks the redditor, having recently earned gold on a few posts and plenty of karma, ""I hope my reddit account is still there...""

=

He sits back in one of the chairs and puts the headset on.

=

He closes his eyes and says, ""Umm… *Reddit*"". He opens his eyes and he’s no longer sitting in an internet cafe chair, but is surrounded by people in the biggest bar he’s ever stepped foot in. 

=

""Welcome to Reddit”, says a voice behind him. He turns around and recognises the man.

=

""You're... y.. you're Samuel L Jackson!"" says the redditor.

=

""Correctamundo"", replies Samuel, ""and you are... a badass mother fucker I see, I like that! I can see you haven't logged on for 20 years Mr BAMF! Well, I guess I'd better show you the changes around here.""

=

“To start with, if you want to upvote something you have to use your own karma. You can either gain this by getting upvotes yourself or buy it at our karma store. Seems you have enough karma already though Mr bamf.”

=

Samuel leads the redditor to the door and they step through. On the other side is an entire virtual world, incredible, vast and almost realistic enough to pass for real life.

=

""Now, we can either travel by horse, which, to be honest, is just goddamn slow, or we can fast travel to the different subreddits.""

=

Knowing what little time he had before he was *zapped* back to his own timeline, the redditor opted for fast travel.

=

""To r/news"", the redditor requested.

=

***zzziiinggg*** in an instant they were stretched sideways and pinged into a completely different area of the virtual world.

=

They were surrounded by tall buildings on all sides with headlines billboarded across each one. Before he could open his mouth to speak, they were approached by, Barack Obama. ""Welcome to r/news"", Obama began, ""I am in charge of this subreddit, let me know if I can help.""

=

""What the actual fuck"", the redditor turned to Samuel and asked, ""what’s Obama doing heading up r/news, and why are you, of all people, Samuel L fucking Jackson, my Reddit guide?""

=

""Well, Mr bamf, years ago the Internet became a very volatile place. For any major website to survive, they had to have celebrity endorsements. The best way to do that was to employ them. Reddit took it a step further and made sure each subreddit was owned by one celebrity.""

=

""Wow"", the redditor replied, ""who endorsed Imgur?""

=

""Beyonce"", replied Samuel, ""she thought if she had control she could finally remove all those hilarious pictures of herself.""

=

""Did it work?""

=

""No"", said Samuel, ""people started hosting their Beyonce images on Tumblr instead""

=

""Who endorsed Tumblr?""

=

""Jay-Z""

=

""I won't ask…” The Redditor said, “And you? Your the guide to this whole place?”

=

“I needed the money dude”, replied Samuel, “after my 350th movie, I’d finally had enough of acting.”

=

“Fair enough… Let's explore more of Reddit. I want to see what's happened to all of the subs. Lead the way Samuel, I want to visit r/gifs"" says the Redditor.

=

They select r/gifs from the fast travel menu and....

=

***zzziiinggg***Just like that... they’re there. Around them are hundreds of low level tables with people chilling back in La-Z-Boys. In the centre of each table, a 3D holographic gif is looping.

=

Just then another celebrity approaches him… It’s Steve Harvey!
 
=

He claps his hands together and says, “Welcome to r/gifs.”

=

""Ha, this is awesome"", the Redditor says,  as he watches through the top holographic gifs of all time.

=

“I’d love to stick around and watch holographic gifs all day, but I’ve got to see as many subs as possible. See ya later Steve!”
 
=

The Redditor and Samuel L Jackson spend the rest of the day travelling from sub to sub.
 
=

r/showerthoughts was on a huge cloud in the sky, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson. To submit a shower thought, you literally had to stand in the shower, think about it and it would be posted.

=

r/movies was a huge movie theatre, hosted by Steven Spielberg. There were over 1000 screens, all playing the current most upvoted movies.

=

r/gaming, hosted by Mila Kunis, was like entering World of Warcraft, create your avatar and roam around the subreddit as a fantasy character, selecting games to play or discuss.

=

r/fitness was hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, If you were lucky you could get some one on one training with the big man himself.

=

r/creepy was like a true horror movie set, everywhere you went there was a scare waiting for you. When you posted here, it was added virtually to a random place, ready to freak the crap out of someone. Stephen King had the job of looking after this place.

=

r/RedditsMuseumOfFilth was right next to r/creepy, but they quickly skipped past it when he noticed who was hosting it. The kid with broken arms and his mother must have become celebrity figures after being mentioned in every Reddit post for 20 years solid. And let’s be honest, no one needs to see a cumbox, cum boxers or the cumwall in virtual reality.

=

They even found time to visit some of the more N.S.F.W. subreddits. As you could imagine, they were incredible. Our Redditor didn’t want to stay there too long, not with Samuel as his wingman anyway.
 
=

After a few hours, it wasn’t long until our redditor was due to be *pinged* home. They head for the bar where they began so he can log off.
 
=

“Hmmm, I feel like I’ve missed something…” he says to Samuel. 

=

“**WAIT!** What about r/jokes, who’s in charge there?”

=

“Leonardo DiCaprio”, Samuel replies.

=

“But, he isn't particularly funny...” responds the Redditor

=

“No, not really Mr bamf...” says Samuel, “but he seemed to be the best fit. Leo was the most dedicated of all celebrities.”

=

“Dedicated to jokes?” He asks.

=

“No”, said samuel, “To Recycling”.

Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.

Officer: The car is stolen?

Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there.

Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?

Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.

Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?

Driver: Yes, sir.

Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain.

The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:

Captain: Sir, can I see your license?

Driver: Sure. Here it is.

It was valid.

Captain: Who's car is this?

Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.

The driver owned the car.

Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?

Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.

Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.

Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it.

Driver: No problem.

Trunk is opened; no body.

Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.

It was an all-male country, and females were barred entry. Any female found within its borders would be sentenced to prison for life. The men reproduced outside the country, and were only allowed to bring their male offspring back into Germania.

There was a certain woman, however, that managed to stay undetected for over a decade through her boyish looks. Her name was Helena, but she went by the name of Franz. Unfortunately for her, she fell in love with a man named Keind. Keind was rebellious enough to keep her secret, so they courted.

In 1995, Franz experienced a wardrobe malfunction in public, and was immediately arrested. The punishment for aiding and abetting a female in Germania is complete gender segregation. Keind was not allowed to visit Helena, or any other women in the prison. He also could not leave the country.

Keind drowned himself in drinks at the local pub. How could he live without the touch of a woman?

One day in 1996, a familiar man walked into the pub and ordered a drink. Keind knew this man, Hanz, from his days in school. They chatted and drank and chatted and drank, and just had a great time. Finally, Keind had a friend again, this would keep him going, and give him a reason to live.

Keind's bad luck wouldn't end here, though. Hanz, a mortician by trade, found himself at odds with a high ranking member of the military. There was currently a war with the neighboring country of Gormundia, and Germania was actively drafting new recruits. The Germania military retires its generals into a comfortable position, where their only job duty was to select and announce the names of new draftees. Additionally, only these announcers could own farmland, where indentured servants planted and harvested all sorts of grains, fruit and vegetables, and fed, cleaned and took care of livestock.

Hanz feared that the announcer would draft him in the next announcement. Keind felt Hanz was going to be the victim of unjust persecution, so he agreed to help kill the malicious former general. It was relatively easy. At night, the farmhands were all asleep and there was next-to-no security. The high walls of the adjacent prison helped provide cover on the approach. Keind was able to easily sneak into the announcer's kitchen and poison his food. 

Hanz, being a mortician, tried to hide the cause of death by falsifying records. His assistant quickly caught on, however, and Hanz was arrested for murder.

Hanz is very upset. Keind was the one who killed the announcer, and yet he did not come forward to save his friend from a death sentence. As Hanz didn't want to die, and had a growing desire for revenge against the cowardly Keind, he managed to escape prison and blend in as a farmhand at the adjacent farm at which his old rival had died.

Keind heard about this prison escape and started to receive threatening letters from Hanz. Scared, he begins to train in self defense. The most popular form of defense in Germania is called Gerate. There are three ranks in Gerate: Boi, Mann, and Tufgai. Keind was able to reach the rank of Mann before he got bored and started to feel safe again.

In 1997, Keind was able to get a job at the prison in which his old lover, Helena, was imprisoned. He even managed to have his guard post be right above her cell. Although he could not see her, he felt better just being close to her.

Hanz was aware of this, however, and planned to take his revenge. He would drop all pretense of being a farmhand, climb the prison wall and do what needed to be done.

So 9 months later, in 1998, the undertaker threw Mann Keind off Helena's cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's stable.",The small European country of Germania,150
