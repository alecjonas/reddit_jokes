The owner beckons and ushers the Nun to the back corner of the store, where three parrots are sat on perches.

Noticing the quizzical look on the Nun’s face, the owner is quick to explain.

“You see sister? That parrot on the left with the single string? Pull it, and he’ll recite the Book of Psalms, without error. The Parrot on the right? Pull the string and he’ll recite the Song of Songs, the Hail Mary and the Our Father. The one in the middle with two? He can do either, just pull one for Psalms and one for the Prayers! As you can see, they’re very holy and sacred birds”.
The nun responds “Wow, they’re amazing, truly beautiful birds! But I only have one question. What happens if you pull both strings at the same time?”

But little did the landlord know, that the man and his son belonged to one of the wealthiest entrepreneurial families in the land. And the man vowed to help. 

For years he funded and rallied and petitioned, and grew weary.  So his son took over, and followed in his footsteps. And built the largest tidal electric facilities in the world, capable of powering not only the coastal village through the years, but thousands of homes through the land.

The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect.  At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with a bucket to gather some snails. Very grudgingly, he agreed.

He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman walking alongside the water just a little further down the beach. He kept thinking to himself ""Wouldn't it be great if she would even just come down and talk to me."" He went back to gathering the snails.

All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They got to talking, and she invited him back to her place. They were at her apartment a ways down the beach, and they started messing around. It got so hot and heavy, that he was exhausted afterwards and passed out there.

At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh no! My wife's dinner party!"" He gathered all his clothes, put them on really quickly, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door.

He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails.

There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering where he's been all this time.

He looked at the snails on the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're almost there!""",A Barcelona dinner party.,15

“Not for me. I'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I've got two chimpanzees in the back that have to be taken to the San Diego Zoo. They're a bit stressed already so I don't want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I'll give you $200 for your trouble.”


“I'd be happy to,” said the blonde.


So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts, and off they went.


Five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of San Diego when suddenly he was horrified!


There was the blonde walking down the street, holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd.With a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.


“What are you doing here?” he demanded, “I gave you $200 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo!”


“Yes, I know you did,” said the blonde. “But we had money left over so now we're going to Sea World

He decided he wanted to purchase a sex toy for her to keep her occupied while he was gone. He walks into a sex toy shop and looks around for a bit before heading to the counter.

Business Man: ""I'm trying to find the perfect toy for my wife, do you have any suggestions?""
Store Owner: ""We have a large assortment of dildos and vibrators in many shapes and colors.""

The business man looks around a bit and asks: ""These are all great and all.. but my wife is the adventurous type.. I don't think these will please her.. Surely she will chest on me while I'm gone. ""

The attendant feeling a bit of sentiment to the man's problem suggests something out of the ordinary.

Store Owner: ""Sir, I do have something that may help. It is very expensive and it is the only one of its kind.""

The store owner retreats to the back room and emerges minutes later with an old box. He reluctantly sets it on the counter and exclaims ""This is very special"".

The business man opens the box to reveal an ordinary looking dildo with tribal designs.

Buisness Man: ""This just looks like a regular old dildo..""
Store Owner: ""You haven't seen the best part!""

""Voodoo Dick the door!"" 

And the dildo flew across the room and began fucking the door.

The business man was pleased and purchased the item.


The man presented the gift to his wife and explained how it worked. She didn't believe him, but tickled his fancy anyways.

""Voodoo dick my pussy!"" She said sarcasticly.

The dildo flew out of the box and into her box and pleased her with many orgasms. 

""How do I turn it off?"" said his wife. The man panicked- ""He never told me how!""

The wife is in immense pain and so they decide to rush to the hospital to remove the voodoo dick. On the way, they get pulled over. 

Cop: ""Sir, do you realize why I pulled you over?""
Business Man: ""Officer, my wife has a voodoo dick in her and it won't stop fucking her.""

The German hides his marble in the stuffing of his mattress.  After turning the place over for half an hour or so, they cut the mattress open, and out it falls.  **BANG**.

The American, as is the wont in these jokes, shoves It up his arse. The guards tunr the cell voer for a couple of hours, and finally turn their attention to the prisoner, finding the marble pretty quickly. **BANG**.

When they go to search the Russian’s cell, however, they spend hours picking apart every inch, search the prisoner inside and out, and finally give up.  The warden, surprisingly ture to his word, arranges his release, but begs the prisoner to tell him where he hid the marble.

He found out the best use for them was to get him home after a night at the pub, because no matter how drunk he got the shoes would always get him home, no problems.

It was great for awhile, but he told me of this one night when he got drunk, as usual, and woke up 200 kms from home in a different city. You see, the shoes ended up getting bored of just going to the pub and back again. They wanted to explore, to see the world. And that wasn't the only time it happened, whenever he got blackout drunk he'd wake up in a new place every time. In the end he got sick of them so he tryied to get rid of them.

But the next morning they were back near his front door. So he threw them away again, and again the next morning they were back at his door.

This goes on and on for days. He'd lock the door but the shoes would kick it in. It got so bad that one day the shoes stole a car and drove off a cliff, the poor buggers, they couldn't steer.

This really messed with the man's head, so he saw a priest, because he was worried that he had created something that can think and do as it pleases and wondered if the shoes would be accepted into heaven and stuff like that.

Suddenly the dog sees a hungry leopard bounding toward it. The dachshund thinks, I’m in deep trouble now!

But then it notices some bones on the ground and immediately settles down to chew on them.

Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dachshund exclaims loudly,

“Boy, that was one delicious leopard! I wonder if there are any more around here?”

Hearing this, the leopard halts its attack. With a look of terror, it slinks away into the trees.

“Whew,” says the leopard. “That was close. That dachshund nearly had me.”

Meanwhile, a monkey that had seen the whole thing decides to put this knowledge to good use,

trading it for protection from the leopard.

The monkey goes to tell the leopard it has been duped. The leopard is furious.

“Here, monkey, hop on my back and see what’s going to happen to that conniving canine!”

Now the dachshund sees the leopard coming with the monkey on its back, and thinks, Uh-oh, what am I going to do now?

But instead of running, the dog sits down with its back to its attackers, pretending it hasn’t seen them yet.

post,8bd38r,2qh72,jokes,false,1523407674,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8bd38r/chicken_and_a_horse/,self.jokes,,"A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety.

The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. 

He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking!

A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer.

The horse said, ""I think I can stand over the hole!"" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, ""Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up."" And the chicken did and pulled himself to safety.

The moral of the story:

If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks.",Chicken and a Horse,233

On his last day, he tells the waitress that this is their last day before they head home and that they won’t be back for a long time. She says nothing and walks back behind the counter. As the man is leaving a tip, she comes over and say, “I’ll show you the tattoo but you can’t tell anyone that I let you see.” 

She lifts up the skirt to show nothing but what looks like a small tail. All of them are confused and looking at each other when she finally looks down and says, “Well doesn’t that suck.

They were looking forward to pleasant weather and a nice time together. Unfortunately, there was some sort of mix up at the boarding gate, and the man was told he would have to wait for a later flight. He tried to appeal to a supervisor but was told the airline was not responsible for the problem and it would do no good to complain. 


Upon arrival at the hotel the next day, he discovered that Miami Beach was having a heat wave, and its weather was almost as uncomfortably hot as Buffalo's was cold. 


The desk clerk gave him a message that his wife would arrive as planned. He could hardly wait to get to the pool area to cool off, and quickly sent his wife an e-mail, but due to his haste, he made an error in the email address.


His message therefore arrived at the home of an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had died only the day before. When the grieving widow opened her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out an anguished scream, and fell to the floor dead. 
Her family rushed to her room where they saw this message on the screen :



Dearest wife, 

Departed yesterday as you know. Just now got checked in. Some confusion at the gate. Appeal was denied. Received confirmation of your arrival tomorrow. 


Your loving husband.

Together they go: ""YAHWEEEEEEEEEEEEEH""

Again a wind sweeps all 13 Jews to safety while their congregation cheers with relief.

The voice comes back on

""Team Yahweh: Score 13. Team Allah eliminated"". Immediately a lightning strikes all the Muslims and they disappear.

After a brief silence the overhead voice booms: ""Next turn belongs to followers of Christ. If they beat score 13 they win""


The Christians who are shocked by what they just saw collect themselves for the challenge and one by one everyone gathers at the edge of the cliff. 

Without any hesitation everyone jumps together with a shout that shakes the heaven:

For a small fee, people could have an important message written down and sent anywhere on the Nile.  It swiftly took off as people enjoyed sharing their thoughts.

The problem was, delivering stone slabs was becoming more expensive.  As more and more people took advantage of his service, couriers began to charge more and more for carting around heavy stone blocks.  Writing space was at a premium and scribes increase their rates per word with the growing popularity.  He needed to reduce costs and decided to contact an acquaintance who lived in the lower kingdom.

""My friend,  

I have come up with a most novel business venture.  It is called slabbing, where you can have a message hand-crafted and delivered anywhere in the land!  Send a slab, receive a slab, write a slab, anywhere in the kingdom!  I wish to include you in this endeavor to share in these profits.  Please slab your response with haste so that we may begin arrangements.""

After paying the scribe and the courier, he waited eagerly for the response.  As he lived in the upper delta region, it would take weeks, maybe even months, for a reply to come back.  When the courier knocked at his door, he was giddy with excitement.

During one of his campaign trips, Donald Trump visits an elementary school and enters one of the classrooms. They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Mr. Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word “Tragedy.” So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy.

One little boy stands up and offers: “If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.”

“No,” says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explains the exalted businessman. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr. Trump searches the room.

“Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?”

Finally at the back of the room, a boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If a redditor reposts another redditor's joke, it would a tragedy. ”

“Fantastic!” exclaims Mr. Trump, “That’s absolutely right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

“Well,” says the boy, “because it wouldn’t be a great loss and it probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”","""What's a tragedy?"" asks Donald Trump",0

The thing that made him stand out from the other comedians is that his jokes were extremely offensive. When you attend a Thomas show, you're gonna get insulted. But, this is why the world loved him. He could hurl insults at an astonishing pace, and had racist jokes up his sleeve for every occasion. He enjoyed his job, and the people enjoyed him.

However, a lesser known fact about Thomas is that he had a brother named Steve. As kids, they loved to tell jokes to each other, but Steve was much kinder, and told more harmless, family-friendly jokes. While thomas dropped out of college to pursue his comedy career, Steve decided to continue to study.



One day, he was having a difficult time making his audience laugh. His jokes barely squeezed out a chuckle at all from the crowd. Suddenly, he saw a familliar face. It was Steve! Right when he had his break, he quickly ran up to him.


""My brother! Its so good to see you again. What have you been up to these days?"" Thomas asked.


""Ah nothing much. Once I finished college, I got a job at some studio. Say, would you mind if I went up to crack a few jokes? I think I know how to make these guys laugh."" Steve replied.


""Be my guest! Head right on up the stage.""


When Steve got onto the stage and started speaking, an amazing thing happened. The audience was laughing much louder than when Thomas was on stage! After every joke, roars of laughed followed. But Steve's jokes weren't insults! In fact, they were lovely compliments, yet the crowd seemed to absolutely adore Steve's jokes.


At the end of the show, Steve took a bow and left. Thomas hurriedly went up to him.


""Steve! That was incredible! How ever did you make them laugh like that?"" Thomas exclaimed.


""Simple,"" Steve began,""these people are redditors, and I instantly knew...""

The fly drops down 6 inches closer to the water.  A fish in the river sees the fly and thinks to himself, “hey that fly just dropped 6 inches, I bet it's now close enough to where I can jump up and eat it!”


There's a bear on the bank of the river, the bear thinks “hey that fly just dropped down 6 inches! The fish will jump up and get the fly, which will give me a chance to get the fish!”


There's a hunter on the other side of the river, and he thinks to himself “hey that fly drops six inches! That fish is going to get the fly, the Bear's going to go get the fish and it'll be close enough just to where I can shoot the bear!”


There is a rat behind the Hunter, the rat thinks to himself, “Hey! that fly dropped 6 inches, the fish is going to get the fly, the Bear's going to get the fish, the hunters going to shoot the bear, and he'll be too distracted to see me grab that sandwich!”


Well the hunter is a big cat lover and insists on taking his cat everywhere he goes including this hunting trip. The cat creeps up being the rat and he thinks to himself, “Hey that fly just dropped 6 inches, the fish is going to get the fly, the Bear's going to get the fish, my owner is going to shoot the bear and he'll be too distracted to see that rat get a sandwich well I'm not going to let that happen so I'll kill the rat!”


So it finally happens! The fly drops 6 inches, the fish jumped up and ate the fly, making him close enough for the bear to run forward and grab the fish. Seeing his chance the hunter shoots the bear and while distracted the rat tries to steal his sandwich! The Hunter's cat jumps forward to kill the rat when the rat ducks and the cat lands in the river.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

post,8b0g4l,2qh72,jokes,false,1523296394,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8b0g4l/car_on_fire/,self.jokes,,"Driving home late one night, a man spotted a car on fire. He rushed over to help and saw that a beautiful woman was trapped inside, bleeding to death. He dragged her to safety from the flames, wrapped her in a blanket and drove her to the nearest hospital. Over the next six months, he regularly donated blood to keep her alive. It was touch and go whether she pulled through, but eventually she did recover and later that year they got married.

For two years they lived happily together, but then she grew restless and decided to leave him. As she came down the stairs one morning, carrying two large suitcases and a set of car keys, he challenged her: “Where are you going?”

“I’m leaving you,” she said coldly.

“What are you doing with the car keys?”

“I’m leaving in the Mercedes.”

“No, you’re not. It’s my car. I paid for that. You’re not having it.”

“Fine,” she said, and threw the keys at him.

“And what’s in those bulging suitcases?” he demanded.

“My clothes,” she said.

“You mean the clothes I’ve paid for? They’re not going anywhere!”

“Fine,” she said, tipping out the cases before stripping off completely and hurling her clothes at him.

“And,” he continued, warming to the theme, “what about the blood in your body? I sat with you for six months in the hospital. You know half of the blood is mine. You’re not going anywhere.”

With that, she whipped out her tampon and said: “I’ll pay you back in monthly instalments!”",Car on Fire!!!,5
