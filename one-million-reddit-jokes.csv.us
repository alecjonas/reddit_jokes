Jan arrives first, wearing beige Versace. She orders a bottle of Pinot Grigio.

Sue arrives shortly afterward, in gray Chanel. After the required ritualized kisses she joins Jan in a glass of wine.

Then Mary walks in, wearing a faded old tee-shirt, blue jeans and boots. She too shares the wine.

Jan explains that after leaving high school and graduating from Princeton in Classics, she met and married Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter. Timothy is a partner in one of New York's leading law firms. They live in a 4000 sq. ft. co-op on Fifth Avenue, where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They have a second home in Phoenix.

Sue relates that she graduated from Harvard Med School and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a leading Wall Street investment banker. They live in Southampton on Long Island and have a second home in Naples, Florida.

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Jim. They run a tropical bird park in Colorado and grow their own vegetables. Jim can stand five parrots, side by side, on his dick.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a cashier at Wal-Mart. They live in a small apartment in Brooklyn and have a travel trailer parked at a nearby storage facility.

Sue, chastened and encouraged by her old friend's honesty, explains that she and Clive are both nurses' aides in a retirement home. They live in Jersey City and take vacation camping trips to Alabama.

Mary then finally confesses that she hast been totally truthful either. The fifth parrot has to actually stand on one leg.",Reunion,4

During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.   

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.   

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""   
 

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""   

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""
He sat down and wrote :
Dear Mother:
I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.
Love,
your son    


Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:    


Dear Son:    
I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…

One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk and spots the loaves of bread behind the counter. Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea.
""I'd like some raisin bread, please,"" the man says politely.
The female clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread located on the very top shelf.
Another young man standing almost directly beneath her is provided an excellent view, too.
Once she descends the ladder, he muses that he really should get two loaves because he is having company for dinner. As the shapely clerk retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what was going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view.
With each trip up the ladder, the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon, each male customer is asking for raisin bread just to see the clerk climb up and down.
After many trips, she is tired, irritated, and thinking she is going to have to try the bread herself. Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below.
She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd, staring up at her. Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells at the elderly man, ""Is it raisin for you, too?

Just look at our cars, there's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days.""

My car is completely demolished but this bottle of whisky didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this and celebrate our good fortune."" Then he hands the bottle to the badminton player. The badminton man nods his head in agreement, opens it and takes a few big gulps from the bottle, then hands it back to the tennis pro. The tennis pro takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the badminton player. The badminton player asks, ""Aren't you having any?"" The tennis pro replies, ""No. I think I will just wait for the police to turn up and sort this out..."" ","""A badminton player and a tennis player get into a car accident""",4

Thus, many visiting ambassadors had to room together. It just so happend that Vladimir, the Russian Ambassador, and Umballa, the Zambian Ambassador, were sharing a suite. To pass the time, Vladimir introduced his fellow dignitary to the Russian game of roulette. He produced an antique Soviet revolver, and a single bullet. It took a while, but he was finally able to explain the gist of the game to Umballa. Intrigued and excited, Umballa loved the game. By the time the U.N. meeting was over, the two had become fast friends. As they parted company at the airport, Umballa told Vladimir, ''One day, you must visit my country, and try our version of your roulette.''

A year later, Vladimir was in Zambia, and looked up his old friend. Umballa remembered him, and welcomed him with open arms.

''I have come, my comrade, to try your game.''

''Very well. Come with me.'' Umballa took his friend before six,
 buck-naked bush women. ''Pick one. Any one. And she will give you a blowjob.''

He sits down, and as he orders a drink he notices a large jar full of cash at the end of the bar. Curious, he asks the bartender what it's for.

""Well, you see we have a tradition here..."" the bartender responds. ""You put $10 in the jar. If you can pass three trials, you win all the money.""

""And what are the challenges?"" the man asks, quite interested.

""Well, first off ya gotta knock out our local bouncer with one hit..."" the bartender gestures to a massive tank of a man standing at the door. ""Next, ya gotta go out back. We got this mad dog with a bad tooth, and ya have to pull it out without losing any fingers. Last, ya gotta fuck Mary over there till she cums"" he concludes, gesturing to an absolutely ancient woman sitting in the corner.

The man shrugs. ""Well, that certainly doesn't seem like the thing for me."" he says, drinking his beer. As the night goes on, the alcohol helps build his courage. After a couple of rounds he silently get sup and slips $10 into the jar. Everyone watches as he sneaks up behind the bouncer, rears back, and delivers a quick punch to the back of the man's skull. The bouncer falls to the falls to the floor with a tremendous crash. 

The crowd goes silent, amazed by the sight, before erupting into cheers as the man goes back to finish his beer with one long chug. He stumbles a bit before looking around. ""Alright! What next?!"" he shouts. They show him to a bolted door in back. With a laugh, two men toss him into the pen with the dog and slam the wooden door shut.

There is a grout struggle, loud barks, a few whimpers, and then silence. 

Expecting to find a bloody mess, the crowd is surprised as the man emerges totally unharmed and stumbling. He looks to the crowd with the smile.

post,3t69ya,2qh72,jokes,false,1447778199,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3t69ya/the_rabbit_joke/,self.jokes,,"So on the island of Newfoundland there was once a tourist, who had come from the United States. He had come a very long way to see the beautiful views and wildlife of the island.

He rented himself a car at the airport and set off to see the sights.
But just as he started down the airport road, he heard a thump from under his rental cars tire.
Thinking he may have rented a lemon, he pulled to the shoulder of the road an got out to check the car.
With utter dismay he realized he had struck a poor defenseless bunny rabbit, that had been trying to cross the road.
The Tourist was a devote vegan and was torrmented to tears at the sight, of the poor creatures limp body laying behind his car on the road.
Carefully he picked up the body an carried it gently to the shoulder of the road.

As the tourist was doing this, a local fisherman, who was off to pick up his brother in law from the airport. Cause his brother in law, Herald, was back on his turn around from Alberta. Well the fisherman saw the strange sight of the vegan tourist cradling the body of the critter in his arms crying on the side of the road.
Being aweful currious an knowing Herald was likely drunk looking for his luggage still, the fisherman pulled over to investigate the situation.

""Whats going on witth ya there skip?"" Said the fisherman
As he emerged from his beat up f150 he had parked on the other side of the road.
Still crying profusely the Vegan looked up at the Fisherman with water filled eyes, still cradling the body of the rabbit in his arms. Unable to speak from the shock an utter devastation he was going through after the event.
Finally he was able to form the words he dreaded to admit to himself. ""I ...I.. I hit this poor rabbit with my car""
He then began to loudly wail in anguished mournfull regret.
""Calm down now skipper, no need bawling your eyes out."" The fisherman said sternly.
Kneeling down he touched the rabbit with his large battered weather worn hands. ""Thats no a rabbit, here we calls em Hares"" 
The vegan looked up at the wrinkled hairy face of the fisherman, tears barely held in, he sucked back a sob. ""What?"" He mumbled, confused by the fisherman's choice of topic.
""Hold on, I gets something out of the truck, fix em right up."" With that the fisherman quickly ran to the rear door of his truck, and began rummaging through the large pile of seemingly useless things he stored there. Within moments he returned, shaking a spray can, back and forth in his hands.
""What is that?"" Asked the vegan tourist, his sadness turning slowly to curiosity.
""Just put em down I shows ya"" replied the fishman.
The Tourist being completely enthralled with what the old fisherman could have in mind, obliged and placed the small Rabbit on the ground and stepped back.

The old fisherman, knelt down an sprayed some of the contents of the can he had retrieved from his beaten up pickup truck, on the limp body of the rabbit.

To the complete amazement of the vegan tourist, the small Rabbit jumped to it's feet! It looked up at the two men an raised its front paw, shaking it in their direction. It then hopped it's way across the road as the tourist looked in a stupor of disbelief. However just as it reached the shoulder of the road on the other side, it collapsed in a heap. 
The tourist roared in dismay! ""Oh god! No! The poor rabbit! What's going on? What's in that can!? What just happened?""
The fisherman paid him no mind, he walked across the road, looking over his shoulder at the vegan he began to coat the rabbit in spray, soaking it into the fur.""we call them hares here skip, not rabbits. Must not of used enough I spose?"" 
The tourist's eyes rolled in complete confusion at the statement from the old fisherman.
But before he could say anything the rabbit jumped back to it's feet! It shook it's front paw again once at the fisherman a second time directly at the vegan tourist. Then it dove into the long grass by the road side, running up over the hill, it stopped at the very crest of the hill and turned to view them. 
Raising both it's front paws it shook them in the direction of the men then disappeared over the hill out of sight.

The old fisherman just smirked, and began to walk back towards his truck. 
The tourist flabbergasted rushed to the window of the truck demanding answers.
""Sir! I must know! What is in that spray can? How did it bring the rabbit back to life?""
The old fisherman just smiled at him
""We call them hares here skip, an take a look for yourself.""
Handing the spray can to the tourist
""And ya gotta read the fine print on er.""

Johnny's eyes bulged out of his head, his whole body became rigid and foam flecked his lips. He then fell on the floor out like a light. Well this did not go as Suzy expected. She thought ""Maybe Johnny is just to young for this, let me see what dad's reaction is"".

One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.

The little boy says, ""It's dark in here.""

The man whispers, ""Yes, it is.""

Boy - ""I have a baseball.""

Man - ""That's nice.""

Boy - ""Want to buy it?""

Man - ""No, thanks.""

Boy - ""My dad's outside.""

Man - ""OK, how much?""

Boy - ""$250.""

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet together.

Boy - ""It's dark in here.""

Man - ""Yes, it is.""

Boy - ""I have a baseball glove.""

Man - Remembering last time, asks, ""How much?""

Boy - ""$750.""

Man - ""Fine.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball.""

The boy says, ""I can't. I sold them.""

The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""

The son says ""$1,000.""

The father says, ""It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.""

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language.

The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!""

The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, ""Where's the money?""

Guido signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again or I'll kill him!""

Guido trembles and signs, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno's house.""

They found themselves stranded on an island. After being there a while, they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down. One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze warm and gentle-a perfect night for romance.
As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. A few weeks passed by and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck.
The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen. She was badly injured when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze-perfect for a night of romance.

Grandpa had given him a silver dollar and Johnny was flicking it into the air and then catching it as he walked along. Suddenly he dropped the dollar, which rolled into an alley where it was snatched up by an old filthy drug addict female. She would not give the coin back and a struggle ensued. In order to use both hands to fend Johnny off, the fiendish druggie reached under her rags and deposited the coin in her scabby snatch. Johnny managed to land a few blows which disoriented the woman long enough for Johnny to reach into those rags and root around for his money. The moment he found the money, she came around and started to struggle with Johnny again. Now Johnny was at a disadvantage and thinking quickly, but not clearly, he put the Dollar in his mouth to keep it safe. With both hands free he was soon able to get way from her and managed to run away. After a few blocks of running he thought there was something strange happening, as if the dollar was getting smaller. When he took it out of his mouth he realised that it was not a silver dollar, but a blood-clot.",Little Johnny's Silver Dollar,0

His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good time to tell his mother what he wanted. ""Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.""

Little Leroy was a bit of a troublemaker. He had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Leroy's mother asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday. Little Leroy, of course, thought he did.

Leroy's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted him to reflect on his behavior over the last year and write a letter to God and tell him why he deserved a bike for his birthday. Little Leroy stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write God a letter.

LETTER 1:

Dear God:

I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.

Your friend, Leroy

Leroy knew this wasn't true. He had not been a very good boy this year, so he tore up the letter and started over.

LETTER 2:

Dear God:

This is your friend Leroy. I have been a pretty good boy this year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday.

Thank you, Leroy

Leroy knew this wasn't true either. He tore up the letter and started again.

LETTER 3:

Dear God:

I have been an OK boy this year and I would really like a red bike for my birthday.

Thank you, Leroy

Leroy knew he could not send this letter to God either, so he wrote another letter.

LETTER 4:

Dear God:

I know I haven't been a good boy this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good boy if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.

Thank you, Leroy

Leroy knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him a bike. By now, Leroy was very upset. He went downstairs and told his mother he wanted to go to church. Leroy's mother thought her plan had worked because Leroy looked very sad. ""Just be home in time for dinner,"" his mother said.

Leroy walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. He looked around to see if anyone was there. He picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary. He slipped it under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street, into his house, and up to his room. He shut the door to his room and sat down with a piece of paper and a pen.

Leroy began to write his letter to God.

LETTER 5:

I GOT YOUR MAMA.

IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.

Signed, YOU KNOW WHO.",Little Leroy Birthday.,22

The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen. She was badly injured when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health.

""Umm uhhh sir? C-could I please have some.. uhh...  water?"" The bartender gives him his cup of water and the little alley sips away happily. 

Then, your typical 2-way street walks in, sees the little alleyway in the only chair and politely asks him to move. ""Mr. alley, you seem to be in my seat, could you please find somewhere else to drink your beverage?"" The little alley squeaks, ""Oh i'm so sorry Mr. Two-way street, I didn't ummm realize I was in your chair. Here you go."" The little alley downs his water and scampers out of the bar. The two-way street orders some Pepsi and sits down to read his morning paper.

Suddenly, a mean old 2-lane highway storms in, and yells ""Out of my seat ya weenie."" The street replied, ""Sir, I'm trying to enjoy my refreshment and read the morni..."" WHAM! The highway smacks the street on the head and the street decides he's going to be a pacifist today ""I mean of course, it's your seat, my apologies."" ""Gimme some beer, not that pussy ass girly cola."" The bartender pulls out the finest Miller Light he can find and passes it to the highway. 

All was peaceful until around 4PM when Interstate 95 runs in during rush hour ""MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BITCH I'M IN A HURRY"". ""FUGGIN MAKE EM YA BASTARD"" and the two hammer away at each other. The two go at it for a few minutes, but the highway could not keep up with the fury of hundreds of short-tempered drivers that had just been cut off. The interstate grabs the highway,""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ASS"" and tosses him where the 2-way street was nursing his headwound. The interstate claims victory, finishes his beer and says ""QUICK BARTENDER, GIMME SOME VODKA""  The interstate begins to down vodka by the handle. 

Halfway through the 3rd handle of vodka, the Autobahn walks in ""Out of my way, you puny little piece of asphalt."" The Autobahn grabs his gun and puts 6 rounds into the interstate. He sits down and tells the bartender, ""I want the blood of my enemies mixed with your hardest rum on the rocks, shaken, not stirred."" The bartender squeezes out some of the interstate's blood from an open gunshot wound and uses the bullets for ice. He mixes it with rum and serves it to the autobahn. But before the autobahn can pick up his drink, a little dirt bike trail walks in. The autobahn says ""Ha, I suppose you're gonna make me move out of my chair?"" The trail starts screaming and grabs the autobahn by his head and rips him limb from limb. With a guttural cry of victory the little bike trail runs out. At this point, the highway has recovered sufficiently to ask the street, ""Gee what's his problem?""

The street replies, ""Oh him? He's a cycle path.""",A little alley street walks into a bar...,2

Joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.

He doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a 'for sale' sign on it.

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.

It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple ,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.

It protects it from the rain, and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.

In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says. And in they go.

Joe is shocked. Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks. Dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. 
But still, Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouted.

'll do the fuckin dishes!
