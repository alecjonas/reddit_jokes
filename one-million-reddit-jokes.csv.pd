The bartender is stunned: in all his years of bartending, he has never seen a gorilla patron. Or heard a talking gorilla. Or mixed a banana martini. Or seen a gorilla who knew how to count money. This gave him an idea.

After mixing the drink, he took the $20 bill and stuck it in the register. Doubting the gorilla's ability to count change, he hands the gorilla back $1, even though he knew full well the drink was only $7.50. The gorilla says nothing.

After a while, the bartender just can't control his curiosity any longer. He approaches the gorilla and says, ""You know, I can't help but say... in all my years, I've never so much as seen a gorilla walk into a bar, let alone serve one a drink!""

To which the gorilla replies, ""At $19 a drink, I'm surprised you have any customers at all!""

The passengers, though very unhappy about it, are more concerned about their safety. So after the luggage is discarded, the plane is able to fly over the mountain. Everybody claps.

However, another mountain appears, thus one even higher than the last one. 

Pilot: ""Dear passengers, we sadly have not reached our desired altitude yet. Thus, we have to throw out all your backpacks, laptops, and other loose objects in order to lose weight.""

Same with last time, the passengers do as told, so the plane gains altitude and flies over the mountain. Everybody claps.

Finally, an unbelievably high mountain appears, easily topping the first two.

Pilot: ""Dear passengers, I am sad to inform you that we do not have the necessary altitude to pass this mountain. Furthermore, we have discarded nearly everything. But fear not, this plane is able to detach its floor to lose even more weight! However, you have to hold on to the handrails on the ceiling until the end if the flight. I am sorry there is no other choice...""

The passengers do as told and grab on to the handrails while the floor is being detached. With that done, the plane passes the mountain.

Pilot: ""We have now passed the last mountain. Thank you very much for your cooperation!""

Everybody claps.",[Long] A passenger plane is flying through the Himalayas,35

He's sweeping floors and wiping tables, when there's a knock at the door. He opens the door and standing there is the filthiest bum he's ever seen. The bum says, ""say fella, could you give me a fork?"" Well the guy figures, what the hell. He just wants this smelly bum out of his face. He gives the bum a fork and the bum goes away.
About 10 minutes later, as the guy is refilling the salt shakers, there's another knock on the door. Another filthy bum, dirtier and smellier than the last. And again, the bum asks for a fork. Bewildered, the guy hands him a fork and hurriedly closes the door. He's starting to get mildly freaked out.
10 minutes after that, just as the guy is putting away the mop and preparing to leave there's a third knock. The guy yanks open the door and sure enough, the raggedest, dirtiest, stinkiest bum ever is standing there. The guy has had enough, he just wants to go home. He yells ""HERE, take your stupid fork and leave me alone!"" The bum says ""but I don't need a fork, I need a straw!"" ""What?!"" says the guy. ""First two bums come asking for a fork, and now you want a straw? What the hell is going on?"" ""Oh, well that's simple"" says the bum. ""Somebody puked on the sidewalk just up the street, but now all the good stuff is gone.""


Edit: according to u/NiceAnusYouHaveThere, the punchline should be ""now all the chunky stuff is gone"" and I have to admit, that's even grosser. I was told the joke by a drunk trucker twenty years ago. I may have misremembered. Or, y'know, suppressed some things.",Probably the grossest joke I've ever heard.,2575

It all started yesterday when I had to change a lightbulb. 

On my way to the hardware store to buy a bulb I followed a chicken across the street. 

Afterwards I walked into a bar where I saw a priest, a rabbi, and a blonde being served drinks by Matt, the bartender with no arms or legs. 

I returned home drunk only to hear a knock-knock at my door. 

There stood my neighbor's kid, little johnny. 

It was at that moment I realized my life was just one big joke.

Pincus reached behind for a bolt of cloth and he said, ""See this cloth? It is from this fabric that I make the habits for nuns. In all the world,"" Pincus said, fingering the bolt of fabric, ""there is no blacker cloth than the cloth I make nun's habits from, and it is from this cloth that I'll make your new suits!""

A few weeks later the two Hasidic Jews were walking down the street in their new suits when they passed two nuns. Impulsively, on a whim, one of the men went up to one of the nuns. He grabbed her sleeve and held it up against his own.

Then, in an angry voice, he muttered something to his friend and they both walked on.

""What did that man want?"" one nun asked the other.

So the boy went down the aisle and asked the flight attendant, ‘If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don’t big planes have baby planes?’

The busy flight attendant smiled and said, ‘Did your mother tell you to ask me that question?’

The boy said, ‘Yes, she did.’

The three of them scream and jump back, aghast at this ghostly appearance which slowly begins to take the shape of a beautiful lady clad in a shining white linen dress.
""Be at ease, mortals, for I am the spirit of happiness and luck, and all living things receive my benevolence. You may bring forth three wishes each, and I shall grant them if what you ask is within my power.""

Still in shock, the three men look at one another, too nervous to speak. The white lady waits patiently, until finally the first of them has untangled his tongue.
""I wish for a credit card that never depletes!"" 
""Me too!"" the second man calls out, lacking a better idea.
The third one smiles, pauses and says, ""Please make my left arm spin around like a propeller at all times.""
""Granted!"" the spirit exclaims.
Two golden credit cards materialise in the hands of the two first men, but taken aback by the unusual wish of their companion, whose left arm indeed started spinning like a propeller, they pay almost no mind to their gifts for the first few seconds. 

Before they can ask for the reason for his peculiar request, the spirit lady speaks again.
""Your second wishes, as you please!""
This time it's the second man's turn to speak first.
""I want to be a famous movie star with managers and secretaries seeing to my every need.""
The first then says, ""I want a super hot wife who never cheats on me and always obeys me.""
The third man just grins and turns to the lady in white.
""Can you make my right arm continously spin too?"" and quickly adds, ""but in the opposite direction than the left arm, if that's possible.""
""Granted!""
The first two men suddenly have envelopes in their hands.
""These contain everything you need to know about your new lives! As soon as you leave these woods, all of it will become reality.""
Again, the first two just stare at the third, whose arms are both swinging from his shoulders in circles.
""Dude, why would-""

""Make your last wishes, mortals!"" the spirit interrupts him.
""Fine,"" says the first man, ""Make me a well-respected and highly skilled painter!""
""Pff,"" scoffs the other. ""That's your last wish? I want to be immortal until I choose freely to die on my own terms.""
The third man, with a smirk on his face, turns to the lady.
""Ok, all I need you to do now is make my head spin counter-clockwise permanently, even when I sleep.""
""What the fuck?"" the second man exclaims.
""Done, done and done. Fare ye well, mortals!""
And with a bang the white lady disappears.

The envelopes of the first two immediately become thicker, and together they turn to the third, whose upper body half is a wild mess of flailing limbs at this point.
""Ok, man, I don't have a clue what you're on about,"" says the first, ""but wipe that confident smile off your face.""
""Let him smile,"" the second replies. ""But let's all meet again in one year and see how we're doing!""
The others agree, and they part ways.

One year later, they all arrive at the agreed upon location and begin to report of their new lives.
""My wife's incredible!"" the first man brags. ""She does everything I tell her to and also leaves me the fuck alone when I'm with my artsy friends, who all love my work! And with all my money, I'm as happy as can be.""
The second man laughs. ""Can't complain either, life as a billionaire and actor is amazing, and I do the craziest of things because I can't die. I won't mind living like this till I'm hundred!""

Finally they turn to the third man.
""So, what about you?""
With his arms and head thrashing around like a human combine harvester, he looks at them as best he can. 
""Fuck, guys, I really think I should have wished for something else.""",Three men are lost in a dark and spooky forest...,1

A drunk got out, watched the performance briefly, went over to the patrol car, opened the rear door and got in.

Julia and the sculptor got together to discuss the plans for this trophy. She wanted it to be made of the finest white marble base with the persian cat made entirely from the finest steel. After a week Julia received the design and the quote. Unfortunately, one of the show’s sponsors backed out and Julia’s budget was lowered. So she asked the sculptor to lower his prices which he wasn’t willing to do.  
  
So they got together again and changed the plans. She still wanted it to like a full bodied Persian cat, but perhaps they could change the materials a little bit. The sculptor did what he could and drew a new design and a new quote for half of the previous one.  
  
Again Julia was faced with a budget cut when the location for the show had burned down. Julia was lucky to find a new location but at a higher price. So she asked the sculptor again to lower his prices, which wasn’t possible without changing the design.  
  
This time Julia asked the sculptor to use a base of oak with gold paint and a cheaper metal for the Persian. And instead of sculpting the cat’s full body, just create the head. The sculptor got to work on a new design and a new quote, but warned Julia this was the last time he would change it.  
  
Bad luck seemed to follow Julia as another sponsor dropped out. She contacted the sculptor one more time and asked if there really isn’t anything he could do. At this point she would be happy to get any trophy, from any material as long as it resembled part of a cat’s body. The sculptor wasn’t happy of course but said he would build a trophy for free on one condition. Julia wouldn’t get to see the trophy until it was presented to the winner. Julia agreed.  
  
During the show, Julia’s bad luck didn’t seem to have run out. Some idiot brought his dog to the cat show claiming it was a good dog. Naturally the dog went berserk and chased several participating cats out of the building. Chaos ensued. But after a long and troublesome show, a winner was finally chosen.  
  
As Julia unveiled the trophy, she saw that the sculptor had made a plastic trophy shaped like a cat’s ass.  
  
It was a real cat-ass-trophy.

post,5y6ofd,2qh72,jokes,false,1488959212,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5y6ofd/a_wealthy_man_had_a_little_boy/,self.jokes,,"For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.

She shot 15 of them with the pistol, until she ran out of bullets, killed four more with the knife, until the blade broke, and then she killed the last Iraqi with her bare hands.”

Dear Son,
I am writing slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did  when you left. Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen within 20 miles of home s we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers with them so they wouldn't have to change their address. This place has a washing machine. The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled down the handle and haven't seen them since. It rained twice this week. Three days the first time and four days the second. The coat you wanted me to send you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little to heavy to send in the mail with all them heavy buttons so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral home. It said if we didn't make the last payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she comes. About your father he has a lovely new job. He has over 500 men under him. He is cutting grass at the cemetery. About your sister, she had a baby thus morning, I haven't found out yet if it's a boy or girl so I don't know if you're an Aunt or Uncle. Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup. One was driving the other two were in the back. The driver got out. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. The other two drowned. They could not get the tailgate down. Your Uncle John fell in a whiskey vat. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and then he drowned. We cremated him and he burned for three days. Not much more news this time. Nothing much happened. Write more often

""The shipment still hasn't come in yet, in fact it should come in tomorrow so if you get here then, you can grab the box that I set aside for you""

""Sir, I have told you before, the golf balls wont be in until tomorrow I will definitely save you a box but unless there is something else you need to buy here I'm gunna have to turn you away""

The old man politely thanks the clerk and goes on his merry way and at this point the clerk has nearly had it. Another 2 hours pass and this time the clerk is expecting the old man to return before closing, and sure enough he does and asks if the golf balls have come in yet. So the clerk asks him a question

Now the rule was you could purchase any husband from any floor, but once you went up to another level you could not go back down, but to exit the store.

A lady entered and the sign on the first floor said 'men with a job', she went up to the next level which read 'men with a job and likes kids'.

Impressed she then went up another level where the sign read 'men with a job, likes kids and has a romantic streak', she liked the sound of that, but proceeded to the next level where the sign read 'men with a job, likes kids, romantic and good looking'.

She was really impressed now but went on to the fifth floor where the sign read 'men with a job, likes kids, romantic, absolutely gorgeous, and enjoys helping around the home'.

Now this lady was very impressed with that, but still she went on up to the sixth floor, and there on the sixth floor was a solitary sign which read...

You are the 3,00,450,701 woman to visit this floor, this demonstrates how women are impossible to please. Thank you for visiting the Husband store. Have a nice day.

Directly across the road from the Husbands store was another department store that sold Wives. And, similar to the Husbands store, this store had 6 floors where you could purchase a Wife on any level, but if you went up a floor you couldn't go back down and had to exit.

So, a bloke walks into the store and on the first floor reads the following sign: ""Women who like sex"".

Impressed the guy goes up to the second floor where he meets a similar sign, but this one reads: ""Women who like sex and are good looking.""

No man has ever gone to the third floor.",A department store was opened to sell Husbands. The store had 6 floors...,920

Before things were getting hot, she disappeared quickly into the bathroom, to check on herself and to fresh up before having sex with him, only to discover that she was about to get her period. However, as she was really into the guy and highly aroused, she decided not to mention anything to him as he seemed to be drunk enough not to notice it anyway.    
     
The following morning, he wakes up, with a searing pain piercing his temples and spreading across his entire head. He only vaguely recalls the events from last night. When he discovers the huge pool of blood on the bed sheets, he really gets freaked out. Desperate and anxious he concludes that he must have murdered the poor girl from last evening and he somehow has disposed her body somewhere. He needs to find the murder weapon and to get rid of any traces. However, he can't remember what he might have used as the murder weapon. First, he checks his pistol he keeps on his bedside table. Nope, all cartridges are there, not a single bullet was fired. Relieved, he says to himself ""Well, luckily, I haven't shot her. But what else could I have done to her?"" Then it strikes him: ""It must have been a knife. I stabbed her to death"" he screams and runs into the kitchen, opens all draws and checks all knifes. However, there are no traces of blood and no knife is missing. Relieved but puzzled, he concludes again: ""Well, luckily, I haven't stabbed her to death"".     

Exhausted and without any idea what to do next; he decides to have a cold shower and get his head straight. As he enters the bathroom and takes a quick look in the mirror, he screams: ""Shit, I must have eaten her alive!!!""",On a late Saturday evening,24

And what better way than to go to the beach in a racy, sexy swimsuit to snag a man. In her youth, this plan never seemed to fail although in that time, they didn't have thongs.

At the sporting goods store she had considered buying a less revealing swimsuit, something that was more in line with the swimsuits she wore in her youth. ""Oh to hell with it, I better keep up with the times"" she said as she grabbed the bra and thong.
At the beach she felt as if all eyes were on her, every man and even women seemed to glare at her. 

Oh how naughty she felt as the breeze kissed her bottom half, she felt practically naked and yet this type of attire was considered normal in this day and age. It felt so wrong she thought to herself. That string riding right up there and so little fabric to cover her naked skin.

At that moment a seed of doubt started to root itself in the back of her mind. ""What if people think it unfitting for a women of my age to wear such sexy swimwear."" What if the glaring eyes she had noticed early'er were from disapproval, and not desire.
Could it be, that in these liberal age, people still frowned on an older woman wearing a thong to the beach?

""Well to hell with them if they don't approve. Although I am of a mature age, I am still a woman.""
As she kept walking she noticed even more wide eyes glaring at her nether region. And she identified that the onlookers expression did not communicate desire, but rather surprise and shock.

A young man standing with his surfboard was particularly indiscreet and stared at her with wide eyes. A look of surprise and fear in his face as he kept staring.

Ms. Nugent had had enough, what is wrong with these young people today? Was there an age limit to wearing a thong? Were only young and beautiful women allowed to wear them?

She stormed towards the young man who looked even more terrified than before.

""What is wrong with you boy? Have you never seen an older woman in a thong before?! Does it offend you? Am I not grandmotherly enough then?!

The young man hesitated for a few moments but in the end he managed to stutter out. ""Ehh, no mam. Its just that, well... You got the bottoms on backwards, the string is supposed to go in the back.""

post,5xz46a,2qh72,jokes,false,1488872212,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5xz46a/wasp/,self.jokes,,"""So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.""",Wasp,6

Naturally there was a big uproar from the Chinese community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Chinese community. If the Chinese win, they could stay. If the Pope wins, the Chinese would have to leave.


The Chinese realized that they had no other choice. So they picked an old man named Ah Pek to represent them.


As Ah Pek was not conversant in Italian language, he asked for one condition to be added to the debate.


'To be fair', he said, 'neither side would be allowed to talk'. The Pope agreed.


On the day of the big debate, Ah Pek and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute.


Then the Pope raised his hand and showed *three fingers*.


Ah Pek looked back at him and raised *one finger*.

The Pope stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is too good in religious knowledge. The Chinese can stay.""


An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened.


The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the holy trinity."" He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions.


""Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us.""


""I pulled out the wine and loaf to show that God absolves all sin. He showed me an apple to remind us of the original sin.""


""He had an answer for everything. What could I do?""


Meanwhile, the Chinese community also crowded around Ah Pek and asked him what's happened in the debate.


""Well"", said Ah Pek, ""First he indicated to me that all Chinese had 3 days to get out of here. I raised my MIDDLE finger and asked him to fly kite, and that none of us was leaving.""


""Then he pointed that this whole city would be cleared of Chinese. I showed him that we are staying right here.""


""Yes, and then?"", asked the crowd.


""I don't know."", said Ah Pek, ""He took out his *lunch*, so I took out mine.""",[Long] HOW DOES THE CHINESE STAY PUT IN ITALY,200

They wake early and spend most of the day training with some meditation and light meals.  Very few words are exchanged.

One morning when the American wakes up he sees Sensei in his garden looking down at his feet.  He joins Sensei outside and looks down to find a grass hopper by his feet.  The student says that during his training he feels the same as that grasshopper must feel in such a beautiful garden.

Sensei glances at his student, who takes this as a sign of encouragement, and continues with a short diatribe about karate training, state of mind, and he makes some poor attempts to tie it back together with nature and the grasshopper.  As this is unrehearsed the student is soon bumbling with his words and awkwardly ends his short speech.

Sensei looks intently at his guest for a brief moment and then, suddenly and without warning, leaps straight into the air and spins a full 360 degrees.  He lands in a perfect back stance, making a loud kiai (yell), with his spear hand attack just barely touching the American's Adam's apple.  The grass hopper is crushed under Sensei's heel.

He's shown an old dog no one wants to adopt because he's too shaggy. The man feels bad for the dog, and decides to take him home. His wife is startled - ""Why, that's the shaggiest dog I've ever seen in my life! Look at that dog! Unbelievable!""

The man finds out that the county fair has a competition for shaggiest dog. The owner of the shaggiest dog gets $100! The man takes his shaggy dog to the fair and the judges unanimously declare him the winner.

After the competition, one of the judges tracks the man down before he can leave. 

""I used to judge these things at the highest level, you know,"" says the judge. ""I retired years ago, settled down, had some kids. I just do this county fair competition for fun, it reminds me of the good times. But when I saw your dog I just knew I had to come find you. I've seen the shaggiest dogs God ever put on this earth. 

I remember the world champion shaggy dog Bessie, in 1989, why, I couldn't believe how shaggy that dog was. Owned by a man named John Tackle. She gave his life meaning. Passed away a couple years ago, very sad. I thought Bessie was the shaggiest dog I would ever see. That's when I knew it was time to retire. I couldn't make up a dog that shaggy. But your dog, sir? I can't believe it. Your dog is the shaggiest dog I have ever seen in all my long life. You can't waste this opportunity.

These shaggy dog competitions, they're very elite. The state competition is next week. I know the woman who oversees it and I can get your dog in. Please don't waste this opportunity, sir. Your dog could be a champion, the shaggiest dog in the world.""

The man listens to the judge, and enters his dog in the state shaggy dog competition. Again, they win unanimously. This time the prize is $10,000. The man can't believe his luck.

Now he's a local celebrity. The media camps out on his front lawn at all hours of the day, his phone is ringing off the hook 24/7, all his friends and family are telling people about how they know the man and his shaggy dog.

The man and his dog enter the national shaggy dog competition. 60 Minutes does a segment on him and his shaggy dog preparing for the gruelling competition.

The man confidently walks his dog out in front of the judges and they fall silent. One judge breaks down in tears, stunned by the shagginess of the man's shaggy dog. The man is awarded top prize, $100,000.

The man's moment has come. There is only one more mountain to climb - the world championship for shaggy dogs. It is a brutal competition. Doping scandals, bomb threats, shaggy dog groomers committing suicide. This is as cutthroat as it gets - by comparison, the Olympics look like a Little League game.

Top prize is 10 million dollars. The man and his wife quit their jobs to enter the shaggy dog competition circuit. They risked everything they had, and the prize money is running out. This is it - the big kahuna. With the 10 million dollars they could finally realize their dream of retiring to a nice cottage in the Scottish countryside. No more work, no more stress or worries. Just the two of them, and that shaggy dog living out the rest of their lives in comfort and bliss.

The man brings his dog out in front of the judges. The head judge leans forward and says:

""Then, we take you out back to the kennel, where our doberman has an impacted wisdom tooth, and you have to remove it. Finally, you have to have sex with Agnes,"" he continued, pointing to a mummy-like elderly woman in the corner, ""until she has an orgasm.""

""Screw that,"" the man says. ""That's way too tough!"" But, a few drinks in, he'd gotten his Irish courage up, and he dropped his $10 in the jar.

He leapt up, ran over to Bruno and - summoning all his strength, caught the bouncer completely by surprise, knocking him out with one punch. The crowd - sensing the possibilities, began cheering him on, as they led him to the back kennel.

Once the door was shut, the crowd heard horrible growling sounds coming from the dog, punctuated, finally, by a loud *squeak*.

He passes by a couple of older boys, they are having a conversation. Tommy overhears them talking about something called ""blue love"". Little Tommy is curious, and asks them what blue love is. The boys give him a somewhat offended look and walk away.

Little Tommy goes to class, still wondering what blue love is. His teacher notices his behavior. ""What's on your mind Tommy?"" she asks.
""I'm just curious about blue love."" Little Tommy says.
The teacher gets very upset, ""How dare you use language like this in my classroom! Go to the principal's office right now!""

Tommy goes to the office, still not understanding what the big deal about blue love is. When Tommy arrives, the principal asks him what he's doing there. ""What do you need Little Tommy?"" He says
""I just wanted to know what blue love is?"" Tommy replies. The principal gets angry and tells Tommy that he is suspended until further notice for using profanity.

On the way back home, Tommy passes a mailman,who asks why he isn't at schoool. ""I got sent home because I asked what blue love is."" Tommy says. The mailman smacks Tommy with a newspaper and tells him to watch his mouth. 

Tommy gets back home,more curious than ever about blue love, and goes inside. His mom asks why he isn't at school. Tommy asks her what blue love is. Tommy's mom yells at him and tells him to go to his room.

Tommy waits in his room for several hours, wondering the whole time what was do bad about blue love. His father gets back from work,and asks Tommy why he is being punished. ""I just asked mom what blue love is."" Tommy's father is steaming, and tells him to go outside and think about what he's done.

Tommy goes out,and he still doesn't know what blue love is. An old lady stops him and asks what he's doing outside at this hour. ""I just want to know what blue love is."" He says. The old lady almost faints, and    proceeds to call the police.

When Little Tommy is at court,the judge asks why everyone is so upset with him. ""All I did was ask what blue love is"" Tommy explains. The judge,as well as everyone else in the courtroom, seems shocked. Tommy is sentenced to 30 years in prison. But the worst part is, Tommy thinks, is that he still doesn't know what blue love is!

Tommy gets out of prison 30 years later, and another prisoner who was leaving that day asks him why he was in jail for so long. ""I just wanted to know what blue love is"" Tommy says. The prisoner chuckles,and says ""I can tell you what that is."" Tommy is excited to finally know. The two are walking through the prison parking lot, when they are both hit by a car.
