First is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. As he does this a huge fish jumps out and bites him. To show who is boss, he beats it to death with a spade. Realizing his employer won't be best pleased he disposes of the fish by feeding it to the lions, as lions will eat anything. 
Moving on to the second job of clearing out the Chimp house, he is attacked by the chimps that pelt him with coconuts. He swipes at two chimps with a spade killing them both. What can he do? Feed them to the lions, he says to himself, because lions eat anything... He hurls the corpses into the lion enclosure. 
He moves on to the last job which is to collect honey from the South American Bees. As soon as he starts he is attacked by the bees. He grabs the spade and smashes the bees to a pulp. By now he knows what to do and shovels them into the lions cage because lions eat anything. Later that day a new lion arrives at the zoo..

post,5xvkgd,2qh72,jokes,false,1488831085,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5xvkgd/magic_dildo/,self.jokes,,"For my line of work I have to travel a lot and my wife was okay with it at first, but after a while she started getting really lonely. I understood where she was coming from as I had become quite lonely going from hotel to hotel. Instead of letting something regrettable happen I told her let's go to Spencer's or somewhere and get you something to keep you company in my absence. 

We go to the mall and walk into Spencer's and head towards the back where they keep their sex toys, strangely enough they only had one single thing and it was a plain white box with the text ""magic dildo"" on it and nothing else. So my wife grabs it and we go up to the counter to pay and the cashier rings it up and he just tells us to take it because their computers were messed up and he was quitting soon, so we didn't think twice and left. 

On the ride home my wife driving, gets so excited to use her new toy she asked me to get it out of the box, and me being the quick thinker that I am, rip the box open. Inside there's an index card and a really basic looking dildo, the index card reads ""say: magic dildo, __________"" expecting nothing to happen my wife says ""magic dildo please my pussy"" and it flys out of my hand and into her skirt and she kind of started to freak out and swerve all over the road and almost immediately we saw police lights behind us. 

She's really freaking out at this point, but it almost looks like she's enjoying it at the same time the cop walks up and taps on the window, and says ""What were you doing swerving all over the road back there you could've hit someone!"" My wife blurted out ""there's a magic dildo in my pants right now, officer.... I don't know what to do."" The officer replies ""pffff. Magic dildo, my ass!"" 



TL;DR I travel a lot, my wife was lonely so we buy her a ""magic dildo"" turns out it's voice controlled, gets excited and uses it in car. Swerved all over road, gets pulled over. Cop doesn't believe her story and says ""magic dildo, my ass!""",Magic dildo,20

He asked that a delegate of both parties prepare a computer presentation to illustrate the advantages of each, and he would make a decision based on what he was shown. His only requirement was that each side be completely honest in its presentation. They had a full week to come up with their presentations. 

When the time came to show their presentations, the delegates from Heaven and Hell brought their computers and set them one-at-a-time in front of Bill. The delegate from Heaven showed him pictures and videos of angels lazily floating around to homes made of clouds. It looked peaceful and beautiful, but slightly dull. Bill thought it looked pretty nice, but wanted to see what Hell had to offer before making a decision.

When the Hellish delegate set down the computer, it showed a stream of pictures and videos of beautiful people on beaches, drinking wine and other beverages, eating delicious meals, flaming desserts and enjoying each others' company. Other images showed people racing cars, playing golf and having a grand time.

Obviously, Bill was much more impressed with the presentation Hell put together and immediately declared they he would spend eternity in Hell. While Heaven was disappointed, they knew that there was no changing Bill's mind. That watched as Bill was led off to his new life in Hell. 

A few weeks later, God decided to check up on Bill and see how he was enjoying his life down in Hell. What he found was a screaming Bill strung up on a rack and being tortured personally by Satan himself. When Bill saw God looking on, he screamed ""WHAT DID I DO? I WAS SHOWN A PARADISE! THIS IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT I SAW!"" Satan shared a significant look with God before saying ""Oh that was just the screensaver.""","In an alternate reality, Bill Gates was killed in 2003.",1

He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. ""Hi, I came for the french lesson today"" our guy said. ""Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week."" ""So there is no one that know any french here?"" ""No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine"" ""Uhm ok. What does it say?"" ""I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone."" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway. The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. ""Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers"" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. ""That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!"" our guy thought, and so he did. Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. ""Let me see"" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry",The French Note,0

Ever since I was a child, I've always had a fear of someone under my bed at night so I went to a shrink and told him... ""I've got problems. Every time I go to bed I think there is somebody under it. I'm scared. I think I'm going crazy."" ""Just put yourself in my hands for one year,"" said the shrink. ""Come talk to me three times a week and we should be able to get rid of those fears."" ""How much do you charge?"" ""1500 dollars per visit,"" replied the doctor. ""I'll sleep on it,"" I said. Six months later the doctor met me on the street. ""Why didn't you ever come to see me about those fears you were having?"" he asked. ""Well, 1500 bucks a visit three times a week for a year is an awful lot of money! A bartender cured me for $10. I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went and bought me a new pickup!"" ""Is that so?"" with an attitude he asked, ""and how, may I ask, did a bartender cure you? ""He told me to cut the legs off the bed. - Ain't nobody under there now!""",Monsters under my bed,24

One day he achieved gathering enough funds to finally fulfill his ambition. He had dubious means of making a living (due to his burning desire to be the proud owner, nay, carer of a Lamborghini), so he went to the dealership (which was no small trek for our friend) with a suitcase of cash, amounting to 100 000 dollar. He goes in and he picks one costing exactly the amount he had brought with him. The salesman tells him it'll be a while to get the paperwork in order and he should be back in an hour or so. The guy decides to go for a bite, since he was getting hungry and it was noon anyway. He goes in to a nearby deli and pays $5 for a tantalizing sandwich and a refreshing coke, a meager token to celebrate finally securing a Lamborghini, a dream he sacrificed so much for. He then goes to the dealership and the salesman brings out the paperwork and finally asks to count the money. They open the suitcase and they discover that the guy is short $5. He unwittingly didn't bring his wallet with him and paid for his meal from the money in the suitcase. He pleads with the salesman to overlook it, but the salesman is adamant that he can not. This is a Lamborghini dealership after all, not a flea market. Desperate, our destitute hero decides to turn to the kindness of his fellow men. He goes outside and starts begging passers-by:

""Please, if you'd be so kind as to gift me with $5 so I can fulfill my lifelong dreams and finally purchase a Lamborghini!""

To which a compassionate pedestrian responds:

""Tell you what, I'll give you $10 and buy one for me too.""",A fine Lamborghini,5

There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show. 

 

""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?"" 

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the captain's parrot. 

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank, drowning almost all who were on board. The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea with, and as fate would have it, with the parrot. 

They stared at each other with hatred but did not utter a word. This went on for a day... Two days... And then three days. 

Finally on the fourth day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said... 

 

""Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?""

The dog says when he was a pup it was discovered he could talk, so the government hired him to sit in and act as a spy in various meetings. He was a national hero. Then, when the dog got older, the government let him go, and he went to work on Wall Street and reported on all the latest secret stock tips. The dog says he was highly decorated. At this point, the guy goes back to the front of the house and asks the owner how much he wanted for the dog. The man says $10. The guy says why such a low price for a dog that was so highly decorated, a national hero. The owner looks at the guy and says ""Aw that damn dog is such a big liar, he never did any of those things.""",The Talking Dog Joke from my Grandpa,0

After some time, when he was not able to catch single fish he decided to drink the whole bottle and fell asleep. When he woke up, he found out that all his cash, rings and gold chain are missing. So he called his soldiers to help him look around. They were not able to find it, but they agreed it must have been stolen by somebody from close redneck trailer park.

First redneck they met told them in exchange for few cigarettes to look in to the last and dirtiest trailer. So they knocked on the door. Ugly, smelly and dirty redneck came out in his dirty underwear with thick gold chain around his neck, gold rings with diamonds on his fingers and cash showing from his underwear. 

Mob guys look at each other and the boss asked him where did he get all that stuff. He said: ""You wouldn't believe me! I was walking 'round the lake and saw this drunk guy sleeping. So I took all his stuff and fucked him in the ass"" and started laughing showing his few remaining yellow teeth.

After a few minutes go by, the drunk starts shaking and scratching. He says ""That can't be true, right? It's ridiculous!

""Why are you eating grass?""

""We don't have any money for food,"" the poor man replied. ""We have to eat grass."" 

""Well, then, you can come with me to my house and I'll feed you"" the boss  said.

""But sir, I have a wife and five children with me. They are over there, under that tree"".

""Bring them along,"" the boss  replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, ""You come with us also.""

The second man, in a pitiful voice then said, ""But sir, I also have a wife and seven children with me!""

""Bring them all, as well,"" the boss answered.

They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as it was. 

One of the poor fellows turned to the boss  and said, ""Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you.""

The boss replied, ""Glad to do it. You'll really love my place; the grass is almost 1 meter high!""

I'll take care of expenses.""

Six months went by and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and explained, ""Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means."" 

The doctor said, ""Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you."" 

Later that evening, the doctor came home, read the postcard, fell to the floor with a heart
attack. Paramedics rushed him to the ER. 
The lead medic stayed back to comfort the wife.

The other bargoers, however, didn't seem to have the same inclination, and so began pestering the Brit.

""Well lookie here!"" said a drunkard. ""We dun' gat ourselves uh fan-see shman-see *Ang-low-Sax-tun*!""

""Hey, yew! Ah betcha y'all ain't doin' tew guud after them Yurro-payeans kicked y'all outta that dumb ol' union they gat!"" another joined in.

The Brit, rolling his eyes at the locals' lack of understanding, replied: ""I do believe you'll find that *we* left the Union of our *own* accord, thank you very much.""

""Oh, *sure* y'all did!"" a third joined in. ""He's lyin', fellers - them Brits ain't got no accordians, that's the French!""

""Ah,"" the Brit nodded, deciding to play around with the men a little. ""I suppose you heard that on your lovely little 'history' channel?""

""Is that s'posed t' be uh jab at us, huh?"" the first local retorted. ""Ah'll have yew know that we 'ere don't *need* yer fan-see puhblic *ed-yew-cay-shun* t' be smart!""

""Matter uh fact,"" the second cut in, ""we 'ere in Miss'ssippi better at *awll* them thangs y'all Brits do up there in Yer-up!""

""Such as?"" the Brit challenged them.

""Well, we gat arselves sum guud ol' futball, and we are *sure* as *heyull* better at it than YEW!"" the third local proclaimed.

""We not only invented the *real* football, but we spread it *across the world*,"" the Brit replied.

""*We* know how to put them blacks in their place!"" the second declared.

""Ah, you went and brought a few over to your place just to mess with them?"" the Brit chuckled. ""How cute. We went and messed with them *on their home continent*. And we colonised the whole damn place, just for good measure.""

""I...er...hm...."" the first stuttered.

The locals then fell into a quick silence, not quite sure of what else they could claim to fame where the Brit could not. The Brit, meanwhile, realised the whole bar had gone rather quiet; the other locals had started listening in to the conversation with great care, hoping to find some small little piece of information that they could take pride in.

Finally, a fourth local in the back of the bar broke the silence:

""Well, y'all may not think too kindly of it, but ah'll tell y'all this much - me here, and the rest uh mah family, and quite a few of them other fam'lies in this 'ere state, are quite good at bein'...close to each other, if ya know what I mean.""

The bar suddenly turned into an uproar of hollering and cheering - finally, something unique to the South!

""Ha ha, that's right, buddy!"" said the first local, taking another swig of his beer. ""How 'bout that - there ain't no way y'all Brits can out-do our fam'lies in incestual relashunships!""

""Well..."" Prince William replied.",A Brit walks into a bar in Mississippi.,14

But the improvements in life have provided little relief from human psychological distress, and no such relief is in sight if we are not willing to tinker with human neurotransmitters and biochemistry for purposes of bliss as readily as we do for health. It suggest the question whether the fear of the suffering of the afterlife can compare to the misery of life, whether the true suffering of Hades is confined with us in this jail cell of a body, and whether we must look to death for relief, perhaps the only relief, even if immortality becomes possible. That we must fear not merely being put six feet below the ground, or another ten, but if we can press through the great tableau of humankind and the plateau of earth that sustains it, we may find below in the underworld a sweet relief that has always been, not merely for a generation, but for a much greater time. That when our death is announced by the town crier, and death takes us from life, it also takes our suffering. That is the very announcement of coming death that defines this square of earth where we live our life. And we must not forget this.

First they asked the robot ""what is love?"" and the robot responded ""chemical synapses released within the brain to stimulate a physical response represented as the colloquial understanding of love. It is recognized as a pure selfless emotion that, in some human cultures, encourages acts of selflessness, charity, and compassion."" The scientists pleased with its response ask it the next question, ""what is hate?"" The robot was silent for a few moments and responded, ""Hate is a separate chemical response that that when stimulated enacts actions of intense violence, malice, cruelty and pain. If left unchecked may lead to the undoing of the individual."" The scientists feeling proud of their achievement ask their third question,""what is comedy?""
The robot was silent. The scientists waited, and waited, and continued to wait for almost an hour. the robot did not respond. They believed that perhaps it was defective and so reset the robot and asked it the same questions again only to remain silent on the the third question. After months and years of resetting and rebuilding and redoing their experiments, the robot would continue to simply stay silent on their third question. Feeling disheartened and defeated, the scientists gave up on their project and the robot was dismantled but its artificial intelligence was still useful for advance computer calculations and was used as a deep space satellite program. Unfortunately little after the satellite was launched into space, the world was absorbed into nuclear war. And so the satellite drifted through the void for eons upon eons watching civilizations rise and fall and continued to drift until the eventual heat death of the universe. At which point moments before the universe collapsed into eternal darkness and emptiness, the satellite looked into the abyss one last time moments before it and all of existence would cease to be and said,

He spent his entire life in dedicated service to the Lord. He never missed a church service, or an opportunity to demonstrate his great faith in The Father.

   One Sunday morning the congregation of Mr. Jackson's church were gathered for service, and there was a palpable tension in the air. When the pastor stood to deliver the sermon, he addressed the uneasy feelings of the parishioners. ""I'm sure most of you are aware of the severe weather expected to begin later today. It is being reported that extremely heavy rains, strong winds, and a strong likelihood of flooding for at least the next 10 days. As a result, I have decided to cut this morning's service short so that everyone can prepare for the challenges we are about to face."" He then concluded with a quick prayer for everyone's safety, and everyone headed to their homes to prepare.

   When the sun rose Monday morning, it had already been raining for about 14 hrs. Strong winds had downed trees all across the state. Power was out, rainfall levels were steadily rising, and roads were blocked with debris. The pastor called Mr. Jackson to check on him. ""Several of the church members are working together to get food and supplies out to our church family. Is there anything you need?""  ""The Lord will take care of me"", Mr. Jackson replied.

     By Wednesday the storm had intensified to record levels. Flood waters had risen to the point that the governor had ordered an evacuation. The men of the church got their boats and worked through the day to get folks to safety. They were stunned when they pulled up to Mr. Jackson's house and were promptly dismissed. ""No need to waste precious time here... The Lord will take care of me"" he called to them from an upstairs window before turning them away.

   The sun rose Friday morning to reveal the town completely covered by water.  Rooftops peeking out here and there were the only signs left of the town. The National Guard, Coast Guard, and several local military units were searching the area to rescue anyone who hadn't evacuated. A Coast Guard officer spotted Mr. Jackson perched on the peak of his roof and directed a rescue boat to retrieve him. ""Go save someone who needs the help"" Mr. Jackson called out. ""The Lord will take care of me.""  No matter how much the officer tried to reason with him, he would not budge. The officer radioed in to the commander and advised him of Mr. Jackson's refusal. The commander ordered a helicopter crew to retrieve Mr. Jackson, willing or not. Try as they might, they could not get him to leave.  The last thing they heard of Mr. Jackson as they flew away was, ""The Lord will take care of me.""

  Mr. Jackson was swallowed up by the flood, and his soul was transported to heaven. As he stood before The Lord, he could not contain his confusion. ""Lord, I lived a faithful life, I followed your laws and commandments, attended church, and in the end you let me drown! I believed with all my heart you would take care of me, but you let me die!""

 The Lord looked down from his heavenly throne and said,"" Damn Jackson, I sent a preacher, two boats, and a helicopter! What more did you want!?""

It's become an obsession and I can't deal with it anymore. Get rid of the tractor stuff and grow out of it or I'm filing for divorce.""
So the man thinks about it for a while and eventually comes to realise that it's time to give up his tractor infatuation. He sells what he can on eBay to pay to redecorate the house and make his wife happy again.
A few days later he's in a bar with some friends and while they are talking they realise it's so smokey in there from people's cigarettes that they can hardly see each other. The man simply says
""I got this"". 
He stands up, opens his mouth and makes a very odd, very loud sucking, whirring noise. Amazingly all the smoke disappears and his friends are astounded.
""How did you do that!?"" One of them asks.
""Simple"" says the man ""I'm an ex-tractor fan.""",There once was a man who adored tractors.,2

""Tybalt, you are my most trusted friend and advisor. Tomorrow I must go off to war for many months. I am trusting you with a very important task in my absence. You are to guard my wife's chambers and ensure no man has sex with her.""

Tybalt agreed to the task, but the king still felt unsure. He decided in the middle of the night, while his wife was sleeping, to place a special chastity belt on his wife. This belt acted like a guillotine, cutting anything off that went inside. The next day the king began his journey.

Months later the king returned from war and lined up all of the men in the castle and ordered that they drop their pants. The king was mortified to see that every man had had their penises cut off. The only man whose penis remained was Tybalt. The king said ""Tybalt, I knew I could trust you! Thank you for remaining loyal. Name any reward in the kingdom and you shall have it!""

The first man says ""For my first wish, I want to be the richest man in the entire world!"" *Poof* The genie hands the man a bank statement showing him to be worth 100 billion dollars.

The second man says ""For my first wish, I want to have the world's largest penis!"" *Poof* The man's pants bulge out and his new massive dong rips right through the fabric to dangle below his knees.

The third man says ""For my first wish, I want my right arm to constantly rotate in a clockwise motion!"" *Poof* His arm starts rotating clockwise.

The first man says ""For my second wish, I want to have the most beautiful woman in the world as my wife!"" *Poof* Out of a cloud of smoke steps a woman every man would be envious of.

The second man says ""For my second wish, I want to be irresistible to every woman in the world!"" *Poof* The first man's wife steps over and starts making out with the second man.

The third man says ""For my second wish, I want my left arm to constantly rotate counter-clockwise!"" *Poof* His arm starts rotating in a counter-clockwise motion.

The first man says ""For my final wish, I want to be immortal!"" *Poof* The genie informs him he will never age nor die.

The second man says ""Hmm. Forever is a long time. I don't think I'd want that, so for my final wish, I want to be as healthy as possible for the rest of my life!"" *Poof* Immediately the man feels like a million bucks.

The third man says "" For my final wish, I want my head to constantly rock back and forth!"" *Poof* His head begins rocking back and forth.

The genie then disappears, and the men all agree to meet up with one another on the mountain in 10 years' time to see how each of them are doing.

10 years pass, and the first 2 men meet up on the mountain. While they're waiting on the third they get to talking.

The first man says ""Man, it's been great! I invested the 100 billion dollars wisely, and now I'm worth 200 billion! I still have the world's most beautiful wife, and look at me! I haven't aged a day!""

The second man says ""That's awesome! I've still got the biggest penis in the world, and you're right, your wife is something else. I haven't gotten so much as a cold in the last decade and I feel great!""

Then they see the third man working his way up the mountainside, arms rotating and head rocking back and forth.

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

Just a minute, she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. Do these excite you? She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.
