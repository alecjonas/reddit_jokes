After the new broke out, US authorities began to contact the aliens using a breakthrough technology. The whole world had eyes on the US government to save the man. After much discussion between the two races, the US government actually pissed off the aliens through their ridiculous demands.

Aliens:""You want your human back? Fine. Let's play a game. I'll be sending your human back on one of the 23 random celestial bodies that will be randomly shot down to earth. 22 of them will contain a dummy. Your human will only have 30mins to live once he reaches earth. You will have to find him before he suffocates.""

Once the news leaks out about how the US government is recruiting top experts in many fields to determine how to get to the human in the shortest amount of time and how to detect which celestial body he'll arrive in, they received a phone call from a 12 years old kid.

The kid tell them that they should be looking for an icy small, solar system body. And that the man will definitely be there. The US authorities laughed at the kid and said there's no way a 12 years old kid will be able to know all these and told him to stop wasting their time.

In the end, the US authorities didn't managed to make it in time as they reached the man too late. But the man's body was found in that same small icy solar system body as the 12 year old kid has said. They were puzzled by this kid's predictions and started to track down the kid.

3 days later, they found the kid attending school in Washington.

A group of nuns were travelling in a car when it had a flat tire. They got out and try to change it, but being rather unworldly, they don't really know how. Luckily, a truck came along and the driver offered to change it for them. They gratefully accepted.

As the trucker jacked up the car, it slipped from the jack and he yelled, ""Son-of-a-bitch""

The eldest nun said to him, ""That is not nice language. We understand that you are upset, but you mustn't use such language.""

""Sorry, Sister,"" he said, and tried again. Again it slipped, this time almost smashing his fingers. ""Son-of- a-bitch,"" he yelled again.

""Please, don't use such language. If changing our tire is causing you to do so, it would be better if you didn't help us.""

""But I get so upset, and it just comes out.""

""Well,"" said the nun, ""Say something else when you get upset, something like 'Sweet Jesus, help me.'""

So the trucker tried to jack up the car again. And again it slipped.

He started to say, ""Son.."" but he corrected himself and said, ""Sweet Jesus, help me.""

At that, the car miraculously rose into the air all by itself.

The nuns looked at the car in wonder, exclaiming in unison, ""Son-of-a-bitch!""",Help Me,14

West to Boston. After almost twenty-four hours on the road,
they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road.

When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk
hands them a bill for 350. The Chinese man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager. The Manager appears, listens to the Chinese man, and then explains that the hotel has
an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for the husband and wife to use. 

But we didn't use them"", the Chinese man complains.

Well, they are here, and you could have,"" explains the
Manager. He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. ""The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here,"" the Manager says.

But we didn't go to any of those shows,"" Chinese man complains again.

""Well, we have them, and you could have"", the Manager replies. No
matter what facility the Manager mentions, the Chinese man replies ""But we didn't use it"". The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the Chinese man finally gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.

The Manager is surprised when the looks at the check. ""But sir,"" he
says, ""this check is only made out for $100."" ""That's
right,"" says the Chinese man, ""I charged you $250 for sleeping with my wife."" 

""But I didn't!"" exclaims the Manager.

""Well,"" the Chinese man replies, ""she was here, and you could have.""

Interviewer notes he seems kinda lazy but his qualifications are extraordinary- 2 PhD's and an IQ of 168. He is assigned to build an EMP bomb by himself, The military has a super tight deadline so he has little time to build the initial prototype. The air force drops the bomb on an enemy target. They're angry, but they remember his qualifications. He's able to work more on it this second time, and proves it can work in a controlled lab setting. However, when it's tested in battle, it fails yet again. The military gives him one last chance to make this bomb. He finishes it, and it works perfectly every time. However, wanting to make sure the bomb works, the military says he must send a video proving it will work.

post,6cyv22,2qh72,jokes,false,1495587268,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6cyv22/reason/,self.jokes,,"So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.
He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day
he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After
eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man
was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow,
he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew,
smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of
no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution,
he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to
eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",Reason,8

Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat said, ""Hell no! Fact is, I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning.

""Yes,"" the man calmly says. ""I have the loot in the back.""

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says.

The 2nd man refuses to believe it. So the 1st man  jumps out the window... 40th floor... 30th...20th... And at the 10th floor the wind gently carries him through a window back inside the building. 

Back at the bar, the 1st man says to the 2nd: ""you see? Its easy. Try it!""

His dad proceeds to say ""No, you are going! I will come with you and help you find a lady to dance with."" The boy agrees and they go off to buy his prom attire.

The weekend rolls around and here the boy is at prom, with his dad. They look around all over and can't find a single girl without a date. The boy gets discouraged and asks his dad to go home, but his dad spots a girl out of the corner of his eye last second.

""No no! There's one right over there, can you see her""

The boy looks at the girl, who also was born with a weird facial abnormality. This being her lips were turned vertically and almost looked like a vagina. He sees no problem with this, but is still scared she will make fun of him.

""Are you sure dad? I'm really nervous that she won't like me""

""No son, it will be fine I promise! Now go, get her to dance!""

A new Private arrives on the front lines during world war 2. When he gets there he is told by the Armory Sergeant that resources are stretched thin and they have no rifles to give him, but they still expect him to go on patrol. He asks the Sergeant what he should do if he has to fight? The Sergeant hands him a broom and tells him if he sees any Germans to point the broom handle at them and shout ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" and it will kill them. The recruit thinks this is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard but he has no choice so he agrees and proceeds to tell the sergeant that he also needs a bayonet, the sergeant looks at him and says. Son, if you come across any Germans and they get to close, just yell ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!"" and they will fall down dead. The young Private thinks in disbelief, ""my god they're going to send me out without any weapons!"" but he takes his kit and reports to his unit.


One day a few weeks later our private finds himself separated from his patrol, hes lost but he thinks his patrol is just through a hedge row. He crosses the road and climbs through the hedge, trusty broomstick at his side. and on the other side is an entire German SS division! Our private freezes, shoulders his broom and thinks ""If I am going to die, at least I'll die acting bravely.""


Our private starts screaming ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"". The Germans start falling over, and more are running at him! ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" They're getting close! ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!"" ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!"" ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!"" The bodies pile around our hero Private, ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!""


Suddenly there is only a single German soldier Marching steadily across the field, Yelling the most ferocious war cry ever heard! our private lifts his rifle once again ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" the German keeps marching. ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" ""BANGITY BANG! BANG! BANG!"" He's getting closer, still screaming like a maniac ""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!""""STABBITY STAB! STAB! STAB!"" the German soldier keeps marching steadily, right up to our Private, he marches right over him and stomps him into a disfigured muddy bloody mess on the ground, all while screaming ""TANKITY TANK! TANK! TANK!"".

The reception was fantastic and everything was going great, until one of the over zealous freeloaders (you know the kind that just tanks up on all the free food) gagged on one of the products, choked and died. 

The management was mortified and afraid of the PR implications on their products, wanted the local police to quickly identify the product which caused the death so they could take the necessary actions swiftly, but the cops said they needed to wait for M.E. to arrive to do so. 

Just then a bystander casually commented ""I am pretty sure he died from one of the mints."" The manager in charge didn't think too much of it until the M.E. arrived half an hour later and confirmed that the deceased did in fact pass away from a mint lodged in his windpipe.

Amazed, the manager turned to the bystander and asked him how he was so absolutely sure, even though no one saw what he had eaten prior to his untimely death.

The bystander smirked and simply said ""Well, I frequent r/Jokes and like anyone there could tell you, the real choke is in the corn mints""",Corny joke,80

She looked OK for a 61 year-old.
In fact, she wasn't too bad at all, and I found myself thinking that she probably had a really hot daughter.
We drank a bit, and had a bit of a snuggle, and then she asked if I'd ever had a Sportsman's Double..?
'What's that..?' I asked.
'It's a mother and daughter threesome,' she said. 
I said, 'No,' - really excitedly.
We drank a bit more, then she says that tonight was 'My Lucky Night',.
So I went back to her place.
She put on the hall light and shouted upstairs: 'Mum, you still awake""..?",The Mother/Daughter dream threesome,737

As he walked between the tombstones he came across an open grave. He walked right up to the edge to see that there was still a coffin inside. What an odd sight he thought to himself - suddenly he heard a thump, followed by an even louder thump. Next thing he knew the coffin was jumping up horizontally and flipped up vertically, apparently trying to get out of the grave. The coffin jumped and jumped but couldn't get out of the grave. 'Fewf', the man thought to himself, the grave stopped the coffin. But just a moment later the coffin jumped out of the grave and started chasing the man, hopping after him *thump thump thump*. Scared shitless, the man ran between the gravestones weaving and bobbing to try and slow down the coffin. But the tombstones couldn't stop the coffin, the coffin smashed the tombstones down one after another. Finally the man reached the gate of the cemetery, picked up a rock and broke the lock connected to the chain. He closed the gate and wrapped the chain between the two gate doors, effectively locking the gate. The coffin couldn't break through the gate and the man sighed in relief, 'the gate stopped the coffin' - then suddenly the coffin smashed open the gate, continuing to give chase to the man.

He ran to his vehicle, started it and drove off in his 4-wheeler down a wet and muddy road. The coffin gave chase but got stuck in the mud, finally the mud had stopped the coffin. The man stopped to look back and confirm it was truly stuck, but then the coffin jumped from out of the mud and made it onto the grass. Thumping along after the man as he drove up to his house, the coffin seemed unstoppable. The man parked right in front of his door, and squeezed inside his home, locking every deadbolt, and pushing furniture up against the door. The coffin reached the 4-wheeler by the front door and couldn't get past it. 'Of course', the man thought to himself, 'I should have stopped the coffin with the car, there's no way it can drive'. Suddenly, the coffin broke open the vehicle's driver door and nudged the gear shifter into neutral, pushing the vehicle out of the way. Even the 4-wheeler couldn't stop the coffin.

*Thump thump thump*, the coffin moved up to the front door smashing against it, but the door wouldn't budge. The door and the furniture had finally stopped the coffin. *BANG*, the door swung open and the furniture flew out of the way. The man ran upstairs and into his room, closing the door behind him. The coffin tried to jump up the stairs, but kept slipping on the carpet. The man couldn't believe it, the carpet stopped the coffin. *Thump, thump, thump*, the coffin made it up the stairs and to the door, *Bang*, the door was easily bashed open by the coffin, it could not stop it. The hysterically frightened man ran into his bathroom and didn't even bother to shut the door, and the coffin gave chase. He grabbed shampoo and a blow dryer, and through them at the coffin but nothing stopped the coffin. He opened his medicine cabinet, grabbed some floss and a toothbrush. Trembling in fear he through both of them at the coffin but it did not stop. He reached in the medicine cabinet for one last thing to throw at the coffin, he randomly grabbed a pack of Halls cough drops and throws it at the coffin. And the coffin stopped.",A man goes for a walk in a cemetery after his friend's funeral,106

Now, he hated this nickname but what made it worse is that everyone said that he was less than a real man because he only had one testicle.

This boiled up inside of him for years; day after day people calling him ""One Stone"" and mocking his masculinity. So one day, he snaps and yells to the world: ""The next time someone calls me One Stone I'm going to grab the first woman that I see &amp; fuck her until she dies!"". Someone yells back in retort: ""Yeah right, One Stone! You're not man enough!""

This causes him to fly off into rage and grab the first woman that he sees. He drags her off into the bushes and fucks her with such fury that she dies in orgasmic bliss.

Pulling himself out of the bushes, still seething with rage, someone pats him on the back and says: ""Good on ya, One Stone! You proved us all wrong!""

This triggers him again, so he grabs another woman and drags her off into the bushes. He fucks her with more fury than the last lady but his heart can't handle the strain and stop on him, causing him to die.

So, what is the moral of this story?

The camel had been his sole companion for years but eventually, time had slowed the poor beast down.

Abu Bakr was considering getting a new camel when he saw a sign outside of a store: WE MAKE YOUR CAMELS TRAVEL FASTER. GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK!

He looks at his camel and decides to give it a shot. He goes in the shop with his camel and the vendor asks him,  “What can I do for you?”

“Well, friend,” Abu replies, “I noticed your sign and I’m interested in your help. You see my camel’s been slowing down a bit and I don’t really want to trade him in for a new one.”

The vendor says, “That won’t be necessary here. We make your camels run faster. It’s guaranteed.”

“OK Let’s do it.”

The vendor motions Abu to come with him out the back door of the shop with his camel. The vendor says, “Please pull your camel over this way onto the platform.”

While Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is steadying his camel onto the platform, the vendor disappears into another door behind the shop and returns with two large bricks.

“Stand back,” he cautions Abu Bakr.

The vendor goes behind the camel with bricks in hand, and smashes the camel’s balls. The camel runs out of the alley like a bat out of hell.

“Wow!,” says Abu Bakr, “That’s the fastest I’ve seen him run in years! But how am I going to reach him now?”

The old man is shocked and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk that although it's a nice hotel; the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00 for four hours. The clerk just rolls his eyes and tells him that $350.00 is the 'standard rate'. The old man is furious and demands to speak to the Manager.


The Manager appears, listens to him politely, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for them to use.


""But we didn't use them!"" the husband said.


""Well, they are here, and you could have."" explained the Manager.


The Manager went on to explain that the couple could have also gone to one of the many shows for which the hotel is famous. ""We have the best entertainers from New York, Hollywood, and Las Vegas perform here."" the Manager says.


""But we didn't go to any of those shows!"" the husband said.


""Well, we have them, and you could have."" the Manager replied.


No matter what amenity the Manager mentioned, the husband replied, ""But we didn't use it!""


The Manager stands his ground firmly, and eventually the husband gives up and agrees to pay. His checkbook is in the car, so he asked his wife to write the check. The Manager watches quietly as she digs through her giant purse, taking her time pulling out books and cosmetics and piling them on the counter. At last she pulls her checkbook from the never ending bag, writes out a check and hands it to the Manager.


The Manager gasps when he looks at the check! ""But ma'am, this is made out for only $50.00!""


""That's correct. I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with me."" she replied.


""But I didn't!"" exclaims the Manager.


""Well, too bad, I was here, and you could have.""",Never Argue With A Woman Who Reads,154

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air, but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man from Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.,19

John learned where he would be eating, sleeping, and working on this giant vessel. He was shown to the engine room and was amazed at the intricacy of his new home.

At the end of the tour John stood in front of a door adorned with the letters ""XXX"".

""What's in here?"" John asked with a chuckle.

""That?"" the CO responded, ""Why, that's Suzie's room. Anytime you get lonely, go talk to her. In fact, you two should get acquainted right now.""

With a blush John agreed and pushed past the door. The dimly lit room only contained two items: a small lightbulb hanging from the ceiling and a barrel with a hole cut into the side.

Catching onto the trick and excited to christen his new position in life, John stuck his member in the hole. Within seconds a warm, wet, caressing sensation surrounded his pole. It wasn't long before the interaction was done and John returned to the hallway.

Grinning from ear to ear, his CO says, ""How'd ya like her?""

Happy, the boy pays the women and goes back home. As soon as he steps in his father hurries to the door and ask him where he was : '' Where were you??? I looked for you everywhere!''

That night, as the young man is feasting at the dinner table, the old man's daughter walks in. Amazed with her beauty, he can't stop looking at her. She winks at him and indicates that she wants him to come up to her room later that night after the old man goes to bed. He thinks about the old man's warning, but thinks 'what can an old man like him do to a young lad like me anyway?'. That night he sneaks into the daughter's room on the top floor and they have passionate sex. 

The next morning as he wakes up he can barely breathe. There is a heavy slab on his chest that reads on the edge 'torture #1: slab on chest'. There is no sign of the daughter and he struggles to take the heavy slab off his chest. At last he pushes hard enough that the slab is pushed out of the window. 

As the slab is falling to the ground he notices a rope going down with it. He sees that there is something written on the slab. 'Torture#2: your right testicle is tied to slab'. He panics and his instant reaction is to jump out the window after the slab. As he is flying though the air the slab turns over and he reads what's written on the other side :'torture #3: left testicle tied to bed'",Triple torture,49

Take it out on someone you don�t know, but you know deserves it. I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I�d forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying �Hello.�

I politely said, �This is Rick. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?� Suddenly, a manic voice yelled out in my ear, �Get the right f***ing number!� and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn�t believe that anyone could be so rude. When I tracked down Robyn�s correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the wrong number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, �You�re an a**hole!� and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word �a**hole� next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I�d call him up and yell, �You�re an a**hole!� It always cheered me up.

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic a**hole calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, �Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. I�m calling to see if you�re familiar with our Caller ID Program?� He yelled �NO!� and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, �That�s because you�re an a**hole!� and hung up.

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I�d been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a For Sale sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.

A couple of days later, right after calling the first a**hole, I thought that I�d better call the BMW a**hole, too. I said, �Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?� He said, �Yes, it is.� I then asked, �Can you tell me where I can see it?� He said, �Yes, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. It�s a yellow ranch style house, and the car�s parked right out in front.� I asked, �What�s your name?� He said, �My name is Don Hansen.� I asked, �When�s a good time to catch you, Don?� He said, �I�m home every evening after five.� I said, �Listen, Don, can I tell you something?� He said, �Yes?� I said, �Don, you�re an a**hole!� Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two a**holes to call. Then I came up with an idea� I called a**hole #1. He said, �Hello.� I said, �You�re an a**hole!� but I didn�t hang up. He asked, �Are you still there?� I said, �Yeah!� He screamed, �Stop calling me!� I said, �Make me.� He asked, �Who are you?� I said, �My name is Don Hansen.� He said, �Yeah? Where do you live?� I said, �a**hole, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. A yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.� He said, �I�m coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.� I said, �Yeah, like I�m really scared, a**hole� and hung up.

Then I called a**hole #2. He said, �Hello?� I said, �Hello, a**hole.� He yelled, �If I ever find out who you are�� I said, �You�ll what?� He exclaimed, �I�ll kick your ass!� I answered, �Well, a**hole, here�s your chance. I�m coming over right now.�

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oak Tree Blvd in Fairfax.

I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. I got there just in time to watch the two a**holes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. NOW I feel much better.� :lol: :lol: :lol:",I am borrowing this joke from a torrent day user who doesn't seem to exist anymore. Let his joke live on!!!,38

On the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had a problem – how to carry his entire purchases home.

While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, “Can you tell me how to get to 1603 Mockingbird Lane?”

The farmer said, “Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house. I would walk you there, but I can’t carry this lot.”

The old lady suggested, “Why don’t you put the can of paint in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?”

“Why thank you very much,” he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home after following her advice.

On the way, he said, “Let’s take my shortcut and go down this alley. We’ll be there in no time.”

The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, “I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me… How do I know that when we get in the alley you won’t hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?”

Shocked, the farmer responded, “Holy smokes, lady! I’m carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?”

The old lady replied, “Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I’ll hold the chickens.”",A farmer's dilemma,33

is that every time you approach a jump, you have to shout, 'ALLLLEEE OOOP!' really loudly in the horse's ear. Providing you do that, you'll be fine.""

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's
ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the
horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over
the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, ""Nothing is wrong with me - it's this bloody horse. What is he - deaf or
something?""

The trainer replies, ""Deaf? Deaf?! He's not deaf. He's blind!""

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check. ‘There’s no charge,’ she says.
‘No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit!’ she says.
‘Honestly, ma’am,’ it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband’s size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.
