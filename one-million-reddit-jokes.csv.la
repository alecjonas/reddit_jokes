He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.
Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, “Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.”


Curious, Attila did as he asked.
Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


“Now hold these in both hands,” he instructed.
Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said, “Thy anaconda don’t want nun unless you’ve got buns, Hun.”",There’s a little-known legend about Attila the Hun.,739

Reporter: Granny, what is the secret to your long life?

Granny: Whenever I felt a little bit sick I immediately go and see the doctor.

R: What do you think of modern medical knowledge?

G: Fantastic! Extraordinary! Doctors nowadays are very efficient and effective.

R: Why do you say that?

G: When I was in my 20s the doctor will ask me to strip completely, examine me thoroughly from top to bottom for one hour, poke me here and there, then only is he able to write out the prescription.

When I was in my 40s the doctor will ask me to open my shirt, examine me for 15 minutes, then only is he able to write out the prescription.

When I was in my 60s the doctor will ask me to unbutton my top, stick in the stethoscope for five minutes and then only is he able to write out the prescription.

When I was in my 80s the doctor will ask me to open my mouth, just shine a torch in, then he is able to write out the prescription.

Now I'm in my 100s before I even sit down the doctor has already written out the prescription.

Such progress in medicine!",Secret to longevity,1

Three guys, an Italian guy, an American guy, and a Polish guy were working construction together on a high rise. Everyday at lunch, they would sit and eat together on an I-Beam, high above the city. Italian guy opens his lunch and says, ""Man, I'm tired of getting the same meatball sandwich everyday. If I get the same lunch tomorrow, I'm going to jump off this beam."" American guy opens his lunch, ""If I get the same damn ham and cheese sandwich tomorrow, I'll jump too!"" Polish guy opens his lunch and says, ""And if I get the same sausage on whole wheat tomorrow, I'll jump with both of you! I've had it!""

The next day at work, the Italian guy opens his lunch, ""Meatballs again. Jesus."" He jumps from the beam. American guy opens his lunch, ""Ham and cheese? Really?"" He shakes his head and jumps. Polish guy opens his lunch, ""Sausage on whole wheat. Again."" and he jumps.

A few days later, the company held a wake for the workers who had recently died. At the wake, the wives of the men who jumped were speaking amongst themselves. The Italian's wife says, ""I didn't know he hated my cooking so much. I wouldn't have kept making him the same thing if I knew this would happen!"" The American's wife responds, ""And I wouldn't have kept making ham and cheese!"" The Polack's wife says, ""I don't know why my husband killed himself - He made his own lunch.""

She was confused, but she had heard stranger names so she accepted it and moved on.

My sister said, ""Well Ms Johnson, Bomanicious has been doing great so far this year! He is definitely pretty shy and does not ever speak up, but he does all of his work on time and seems very attentive!""

They were the best. This was FIFA 08.

Jared was the best. James was smarter. Team player. Knew how to pass.

All I could do was take Jared down. I was the best at defense.

If Jared was in the box, he was going to dupe the keeper. I had only one choice but to take him down.

I had a trick up my sleeve. I was the Mega Man Soccer master. I am the Master of penalty shoot outs.

I once ended a game with 6 men on the field.

I once ended a game with no men on the field. I didn't know that you had to have a minimum number of players. I believe it is 6.

He lives in Boston and for the last 2 days they’ve had non stop snow  temperatures of -16 degrees and gale force winds of up to 60mph.  They are totally isolated and his mother-in-law hasn’t done anything else other than looking through the kitchen window.  He was saying that if it carries on like that he will have no alternative but to let her in.

[EDIT]
TL;DR (upon advice):

The weather here is terrible. My MIL hasn’t done anything else other than staring through the kitchen window. I might have to let her in.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",A handsome man went into a hotel...,0

Arjuna tries and shoots the arrow, but misses the parrot. 

""Fuck I missed it."" he goes. 

Dronacharya gets a little startled, eyes Arjuna in angst and mutters, ""Arjuna, you come from a family of Royals. These kind of words dont suit you. Now, I know you missed, but if you concentrate hard enough, I am sure you'll hit the parrot's eye. So, try again.""

Arjuna tries again, misses again.

""Fucking hell missed that fucker again.""

Dronacharya gets furious. His eyes turn red from anger, and he screams, ""Arjuna, if you say these words one more time, there'll come a storm, the God himself will speak (aakaashvaani) the lightnings will strike the very ground around you and one of them will hit your anus.""

Arjuna gets scared looking at Dronacharya. Pretty tensed, with shaking hands, he picks up his Gaandiv (Bow), and shoots another arrow.
Expectedly, the arrow misses. Arjuna can't help it and again goes ""This fucker can't be hit. What a fucking disaster!""

And just that very moment, there is a thunder, rumble of lightning, The aakashvaani happens, and the lightning starts to strike around, but instead of Arjun's anus, it hits Dronacharya's anus.

""Okay."" the Chinese man replied.

""Yeah? Fine... we'll see how you like it. Lets pretend this is your bar. Ill go outside and come back in pretending to be YOUR customer."" Tom proposed.

""Okay."" The Chinese man replied... He got up and went behind the bar and started wiping it down while Tom exited.

Tom waits 10 seconds, and then reenters. He sits at the bar and says:

What?

""Don't worry. I call this Chronosgame.""

What?

""You fucked up, so now we gotta spit game through time. It's called a Chronosgasm.""

What the fuck are you on about?

""We are going to fucking plant a seed of righteousness. Your mission. Smile at every girl you see. Say hi to every girl you see. Pole every girl you see. Say stupid ass shit. Make a scene. Go loud. Go loud as fuck. Your funny as shit!""

""WHAT THE SHIT?!""

Ya. Or wait? No. Maybe not. I don't remember.

""Any way. This is Chronos' Game. It's called a chronosgasm.""

Basically, the dream was me calculating all the times I could possibly randomly run into all of my friends. We were all going in different directions. I had no control.

I dreamed of every where all of the kids at Tesoro, Las Flores, and Las Naranjos, and The Ranch, and IVC preschool and Sylvan Learning Center and Montessori preschool and my cousin and their cousins and all the eEye workers and their kids and every possible which way and what I realized was I was one marble. And there were infinitely many marbles and infinitely many directions and infinitely many different velocities they could all go. It's how you create a hyperspace jump. One marble against an infinitely many time times an infinitely many possibilities times and infinitely many marbles. Shit is completely undefined. You fire the marble. You have no way of calculating that many projectories. But you can just fire that marble really hard, and as loud as you can make it. 

And then the marbles will always be levitating around you, as you accumulate more mass. But never holding on too tight, letting those marbles disperse. So they can spread. Be good at Goodbyes. 

Leave a Goodbye with some emotion. Or it will really be goodbye. 

Also, you can fucking masturbate obviously that's not a big deal.

Shit I'm on Vacation. 

But yeah. First time I ever squatted I did 225 10 times. I was 18. First 40 time I tried: 5.0. I was 6'4"" 204. I could do 225 1 time. ","After I got suspended from High school, and unable to go to prom, I fell asleep in class and had a dream:",0

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him just like his parents and he refused to live with her. Then the judge suggested he live with his grandparents; the boy cried and said that they also beat him.

Now learning that violence was apparently a way of life for the family, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

After conferring with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cleveland Browns whom the boy firmly believed were incapable of beating anyone.",Court Custody,98

  A week after arriving back home in the States, he wakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots.

  Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results.

  The man returns, a couple of days later, and the doctor says, 'I've got bad news for you, you've contracted Mongolian VD. It's very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it.'

  The man looks a little perplexed and says, 'Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, Doc.'

  The doctor answers, 'I'm sorry, there's no known cure. We're going to have to amputate your penis.'

  The man screams in horror, 'Absolutely not! I want a second opinion.' The doctor replies, 'Well, it's your choice. Go ahead, if you want, but surgery is your only choice.'

  The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he'll know more about the disease.

  The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, 'Ah, yes, Mongowyian VD. Vewy ware disease.'

  The guy says to the doctor, 'Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!'

  The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs. 'Stupid Amerlican docttah, always want to opawate. Make more money dat way. No need to amputate!'

the decision was made that they must go, they would uproot and migrate the whole village to a better suited region.  seeking refuge they encountered tall grasslands upward of 4 feet tall.

The bartender doesn't seem to care, he says 'You know, it doesn't really matter, I'm not hourly, I work for tips. You're not losing anything.' 

Owner snarkily says, ""Here's a tip, don't be late."" 

Bartender chuckles and just blurts out something that's been running through his mind for years: ""You know what, I've always loved you. Your sense of humor, your smile, everything about you. Let's run away and get married. Tonight."" 

The owner, having a crush on the bartender and secretly waiting to hear this for years, agrees without hesitation. 

They both hastily jump in the owner's car, drive to Vegas, and elope. Neither had much so they decide to throw their old lives away and start anew in a new state.

After many successful years of marriage, the bartender and the owner of the bar, who, by this point, have raised four wonderful children, decide it's time to retire together. They use the money from the sale of the bar and their life savings and move to Barbados. 

Four years into retirement, the owner of the bar catches a fever and becomes incredibly ill. Worried about their future together, and wanting to cherish every moment left, the ex-bartender pulls out an ornate wooden lockbox he's had with him since that fateful night in 1972, that night when they threw it all away to live together. The bartender says ""You know, love, I've been holding onto this box for forty-six years, inside of it is a token of my unrequited love for you. I want you to have it. The bartender then hands the box to the owner. The owner, weakened by this incredible illness, tugs as hard as possible on the lock... Nothing. Tugs again. Nothing.

The painting depicted three black men totally naked sitting on a park bench. Two of the figures had black willies, but the one in the middle had a pink willie.

The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his assessment.

He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of black men in a predominately white, patriarchal society. 'In fact,' he pointed out, 'some serious critics believe that the pink willie also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society.'

After the curator left, an Irishman, approached the couple and said, 'Would you like to know what the painting is really about?'

'Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery?' asked the couple.

'Because I'm the guy who painted it,' he replied.

'In fact, there are no black men depicted at all! They're just three Irish coal miners. The guy in the middle went home for lunch.'","At the National Art Gallery in Dublin, a husband and wife were staring at a portrait that had them completely confused.",278

When Walter wakes up a few hours later, there is an Angel standing in front of him. „What happend?“, he asks a little confused. „I‘m sorry Walter. You died while you were asleep.“, the Angel answers.

Walter is really sad to hear this. He still had so many plans for his life. The angel tries to cheer him up: „Walter, you lived a good life. You‘ve been a great husband, the best father a child could wish for and always friendly to everyone you met. So god wants to give you a second chance. You‘ll be reborn as an animal and you can choose what kind of animal you want to become.“

„Chicken!“, Walter says immediatley. „I want to be a chicken. I always loved them and wondered what it would be like living like them.“

The angel agrees and so Walter becomes a chicken. He wakes up on a big farm with a lot of other animals. Cows, horses, pigs and houndres of other chicken. He walks around and gets to know everybody, really enjoying his new home. But he feels a little weird around his butt so he asks the other chicken about that.

„Yeah that‘s normal. You have to lay an egg.“ they say. So Walter squeezes his muscles and and an egg comes out. Yet he still has this weird  feeling so he tries again and another egg comes out. He keeps going and a third, a fourth, even a fith egg comes out. There seems to be no end to this.

Suddenly he hears a familiar voice calling his name: „Walter! Walter, wake up!“ He wakes up with his wife shouting next to him:

„Walter, what the hell? You‘re shitting all over the bed, you idiot!“",Walter the chicken,11

Armageddon arrives and the battle begins.  Jesus and Satan are both tasked with the most complicated programming task ever given.  This is the type of task even Linus Torvalds would declare impossible.  Jesus and Satan are put in a room with two computers, the doors are locked, and they are given 8 hours.

The hours go by and Jesus and Satan are both programming at a pace never witnessed in human history.  Satan is typing so fast the computer isn't keeping up and Jesus has already created two new programming languages complete with documentation just to make the rest of the task easier.  After 7 hours go by, there's a loud POP and the power goes.  The room goes completely dark and both computers go to black.

Satan is fuming, breathing fire, doing all sorts of angry devil-like stuff.  He's cursing and screaming ""I've lost all my work!  This is terrible!  Neither of us can possibly win now.""  Then he looks over at Jesus and he's just sitting calmly in his chair, reclining a little bit, and has his eyes closed catching a rest.  Satan can't stand it, ""What are you doing over there?  How can't this upset you!""  Just then the power comes back on, Jesus types for a few more seconds, submits his code, looks at Satan and says ""It's over, I've won.""

Now Satan is really furious ""How is that possible! How can you have re-written everything that took even you hours to complete in a few seconds""
