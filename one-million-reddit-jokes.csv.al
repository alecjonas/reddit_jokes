At one point, while I was at university, I went to Germany for Erasmus and I met a university colleague that I ended up dating for a while.

She had the strange fetish of giving me a score whenever we made love.

One night, after a few kisses and groping, I decided I was going to have anal sex with her. 

So, in the middle of the passion and the heat of the moment, I put my penis in her ass, without preparation, without warning, without lubricant at all.

She didn't even wait for the intercourse to end, I never got such a high score, she just screamed ""Nein"" ""Nein"".

The IRS decided to audit Grandpa, and summoned him to the IRS office. The IRS auditor was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his attorney.

The auditor said, “Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.”

“I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Grandpa. “How about a demonstration?”

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, “OK. Go ahead.”  
Grandpa says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.”

The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.”  
Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.”

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.  
Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

“Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

“Are you OK?” the auditor asks.  
“Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”",The Aduit,33

The bigger guy points to the unmarked storefront behind him and says “there is a genie inside granting wishes.”

Mouth agape, hardly believing what he hears, the man curiously walks inside, and sure enough, sees a small golden lamp sitting on a table. He rubs the lamp, and a wispy trail of smoke begins to leak out, coalescing into the basic stereotypical genie, shirtless vest, turban, baggy pants and all. In a booming voice, the genie says, “WELL MET, TRAVELER, WHAT IS YOUR HEART’S DESIRE? I CAN GRANT YOU ONE WISH!”

“I’d like to be incredibly rich!”

“SAY AGAIN?”

“I’d like to be rich beyond my wildest dreams!”

“I’M SORRY YOU’LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP!”

Raising his voice to a shout, the man says again “I WANT A MILLION BUCKS!”

The genie registers a look of recognition and snaps his fingers, and materializing out of thin air, countless ducks appear, quacking and flapping their wings, covering every inch of the floor, falling and flailing all over each other, and streaming further out the door. The genie disappears back into his lamp. Simultaneously awestruck and pissed off, he rubs the lamp again to no avail.

""You can't afford me.""

""Try me, how much for a strip show?"" He replies.

""$10,000 dollars even."" she says.

""You can't be serious?!"" He proclaims.

""Let's take a walk outside."" She replies. He agrees and they walk outside the casino into a private parking garage filled with luxury vehicles. ""You see these cars? I own these cars because men pay me for a strip show.""

He thought for a few moments. ""Damn, I should get my money's worth then. Alright."" She brings him to a velvet bedroom and as expected he gets the best strip show he has ever had. After he finishes, he realizes how perfect she is and asks. ""Okay, that was awesome. How much for a blow job?""

""$25,000"" she replies.

""$25,000?!? You are out of your mind. In your dreams!"" He shouts

""Come to the window."" They walk to the window and she begins to point. ""You see those three casinos? I own those casinos because men pay me $25,000 for blow jobs.""

""Well, I'm paying for quality so how can I say no?""

Once again, it is the blow job of his life. He is writhing in ecstasy after finishing, and he's practically in love with this woman. ""Okay, I am gonna regret this. How much for the pussy?""

""Come to the window."" He follows her to the window, ready for anything. ""Do you see all of Las Vegas?"" She asks.

""No way! You own all of Las Vegas?!"" He exclaims, astounded.

""No.."" she looks down. "" But I would if I had a pussy...""

So Little john runs to the table, takes a plate and puts a mountain of cold potatoes on it! His mother comes up next to him and says “Little John what you put on your plate...” and Little John finishes his mother sentence with “...I have to eat... I know mom! But i really love cold potatoes!”

So Little john goes to the table, finds himself a chair and he waits politely untill the whole family is seated before he starts eating. 

Everybody is at the table and little John starts shoving those cold potatoes inside his mouth! “Nom nom nom grafmlskbvjsll”! When suddenly there falls a cold potato on the ground... Oh No!

And He told his mom he would eat all the cold potatoes... so he slides his chair behind him and crawls underneath the table to find his cold potato... 

But just before he grabs the cold potato... he sees... between the legs of his aunt... a little hamster. 

And he thinks to himself ‘I have to give this cold potato to that little hamster’!

So he goes with the cold potato inbetween the legs of his aunt and just an inch away from that little hamster, the little hamster goes 
“Ppppppprrrttttttttttt”

post,fe7fpq,2qh72,jokes,false,1583465321,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fe7fpq/there_was_once_a_man_named_john_a_master_tailor/,self.jokes,,"There was once a master tailor named John. John was never someone to start a fight, raise his hand in the classroom, or ask a person to the ballroom dance. Over all that, he preferred to stay in his workshop, creating clothes and sharing creations with the world.

One day, John was given a particularly difficult job from a new client, one of a particurally high status in the city, and he wanted a piece of clothing with a *personality*. John had never heard such a request, and was beginning to take it literally. Since he was a reasonable, well thinking common man, John thought the client was fucking insane - still, nonetheless, the pay was too good to pass up. The only other thing the client said, after signing the appropriate papers and shaking the appropriate hands, was that he would be back in three days, at the last hour John was open.

John was stuck on this problem for quite awhile, he had other small things on his schedule but he was consumed by this request. He thought for quite awhile, took a walk through the streets and alleyways around his workshop, and returned inspired and aroused to the adventure. He worked from twelve to twelve, up high and down low, his hands were moving faster than they had ever moved before. His eyes were red, his legs were shaking, and after a long build up in the twilight of the night, he finished.

He wiped the sweat from his brow, and paced around the workshop to clean up the mess. The coat he made was white and gleaming. It reflected all the light in the room, it drew the eyes of animals outside the windows, it drew the eyes of angels, shedding a single tear for it’s beauty impounded on the world, sinking it's precense like a diagram of space-time. John was well aware of all of this, and for the time being, put it up on a coat hanger to be displayed from the front window. It wasn’t perfectly displayed, but it would do for the night.

While tending to all of the last affairs of the now early morning, illuminated by candle light, John heard a loud thump behind him - \***thump**\* - it made him jump. He swung his head back like a tetherball, *was someone breaking in to steal the coat?* No, alas, his fears were unfounded. The coat had simply falled down, most likely due to the hastiness of setting up the display.

John put the coat hanger back in its place and returned to his duties. He had picked up a broom and was sweeping up the loose threads he had left when he, again, heard another thump, louder than before - **\*THuMP.\*** After working for so long, the disturbance made John begin to become agitated, something that didn’t happen often.

He put the coat back up for what had now been the third time. John tipped the coat hanger back up, having it wobble side to side on it's way there. John turned his head in jest, half joking to himself - thinking it would fall over the moment it left his gaze. Sure enough, the second his eyes left the coat, he heard the quickest and sharpest thump yet - ***\*THUMP\****

Not much can break a man like John, but after over a dozen hours of tireless work, this was the last straw. He held his anger back in fear of disturbing the neighborhood, or at this rate, the city.

John’s arm gave out from clenching it so hard before he could muster a word, the tailoring had made a mark on him, clearly, and he calmed himself down. After doing so, he began to *talk* to the coat - “...You’re pretty annoying, do you think this is funny?”

The air was dead, his candle brushed the room with a frail light and smoke, then the air was cracked by a shrill call, a voice calling back to him, “YoU’Re PrEtTy AnNoYiNg.”

John sputtered, confused “Wha-What?” *The coat was talking back to him*! Now he was sure he was the one who was insane. But his confusion soon turned to tirelessness.

The Coat continued to bicker, speak, and talk back to itself. It asked questions with no answers, and answers with no questions. It didn’t move, but it’s voice bounced around the room. It yelped some, and squealed the rest. It became clear to John that it was an annoying fucking coat.

John refused to listen to the coat ramble on, and decided to get rid of it, despire the risks. He artistically titled the coat “Goodbye Annoying Coat,” and made rid of it in the alleyway near his backdoor, hoping it would keep the raccoons company, or scare them off. 

He returned along with the sun to start again, day 2.

Again, John worked like he had never worked before, but now on something smaller. His body moved from side to side, to and fro, he moved at such a ferocity his feet swept the floor for him. His fingers flexed, dipped, dived. His needle thrust back and forth, in an unwavering pattern. At this point, life was being concieved from John's own hands. This quest consumed his entire work day, but this didn't seem to phase John. However, despite that, he was now on attempt number two for one single client, and what did he have to show for it? A red, wool hat.

The hat was striking. It pulled the attention of everything in the room. It beckoned you to look at it like a prisoner in an orange jumpsuit, a car crash on the side of the road, it intimidated anyone looking for a fight. The red wool John had used certainly had paid off.

John was expecting the hat to talk this time, so he started the conversation with a simple pleasantry. “Hello. How was your day?” Nothing, not as much as a peep. John repeated the question, “How was your day?” The hat stood still - then, suddenly John heard a small chirp rise from the table, it sounded like an 8 year old child.

“Fuk u bitch.”

""I'm sorry?""

The voice came back louder, yet not deeper nor more resonant.

""Fuck you bitch""

This didn’t phase John at all, it was just a little baby! To play it safe, John ran up to the roof of the building, set the hat on fire, and then threw it into a devil's pit of fireworks and gasoline, then smothered what was left with the strike of god itself, more gasoline.

Before doing so, however, John choose the hat a name for it’s last dying wish - “Die, Angry Hat.”

The next day, John’s paranoia had reached an all time high, and another bust would ruin him. He had only till the store closed to finish what he had started days before, and the pressure was getting to him.

Jack scrambled, he beat to and fro, he whisked, and he poured. The eggs were pretty good, however missing some salt. 

After that, John was ready to go, this time ready to make something even smaller and quicker than he had ever done before.

In just three hours John had made his first sock of two, a new record, but he hadn't nailed down the personality. Too much was in doubt, and he wasn't quite sure what went wrong the last two times.

So, anxious, he bit his knuckles as he set the sock in place, ready to speak to it. He didn’t know how it was going to turn out. Would it’s small size make it more infantile? 

More annoying? 

More angry? 

He wasn’t sure. So to test it’s intellect and temperment, he asked it a simple question, “Hey, what is the nearest lake to our city?” The sock immediately responded, much to the surprise of John, “Well Lake Limbaugh is the closest of course! - Just 13 miles to the West, can't miss it!” The sock spoke in an welcoming, upbeat tone, like a ticket server or what John imagined a butler sounded like.

John checked a world atlas to make sure... he didn’t actually know the answer, and the sock was right! John continued to speak to it, he was enlightened by every answer. The sock was cordial, it was funny, it always included you in the conversation. It took all the energy in the room, but gave twice what it took. John talked to it, laughed and shared stories for hours. He talked so much, he forgot to make a second sock!

John was about to freak out, what was going to happen? The client was supposed to get there in twenty minutes? Will he be happy with a *sock?* However, John's new stiched friend was understanding, and promised the client would understand. John believed the sock over himself.

Finally, once the client got there, the client was in awe. He wore a top hat, had a danglingly monocle balanced on his face, and his fancy coattails were nearly brushing the floor. He attempted to hang his coat on the coathanger by the door, but John recconed against it.

The client looked at the sock from every angle, asked every question, he spun the sock around, threw it in the air, and they were both laughing and playing together. It made him a kid again. He, after another swift twenty minutes of pure happiness and joy, started to address John, who was grinning ear to ear the whole time.

The client addressed John as if he was a life long frined, in a small shout, not realising the room was dead silent. His top hat and monocle were tilted and unadjusted from his jumping and playing, “This sock… This sock… Well, it’s amazing!”

“Thank you.” John responded, mimicking a cordial bow.

“This sock… This sock… It’s enlightening!”

“Thank you.” John again bowed, for what seemed like the twentieth yet second time

“This sock is so great, I shall pay *twice* what I offered you before!”

John lit up, “Oh, thank you sir!” He called out, in genuine excitement

The client continued, oggling his feet, “This sock is so wonderful, I don’t want another! It would split my attention between the two!”

John nodded. Feeling lucky the client was happy that his feet wouldn’t match.

“This sock is so wonderful I shall tell *all* the papers about it! Everyone should know your wonderful craft. Oh how gobsmackingly merry it is! Simply wonderful.”

This was the best day of John’s life.

“This sock, what should I call this sock? You must have a name? Right?”’

John paused, he hadn't made one yet. He considered his options, and remembered the first word he spoke to this pleasant, elated, joyful, wonderful sock. And then he named it.

“Hey, Nice Sock.”","There was once a man named John, a master tailor.",3

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""  

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery,

That night the boyfriend is still standing in the living room still posed, too afraid to escape. He hears the husband wake up and open the bedroom door. The husband walks past him, opens the fridge, pops open a beer and makes a bologna sandwich. He then walks up to the boyfriend and hands him the beer and sandwich and says ""Here, I was next door at Mrs.Johnson's house stuck in that position for 2 days and no one gave me anything to eat.""

The boy is so excited and feels like it takes forever for the big day to arrive.  Finally, it’s time to go to the circus.  They arrive early and get front row seats, sodas and peanuts.

First the jugglers come out, and then the lion tamers, and then the elephants, and even motorcycle stunt riders do their tricks.  Finally, a tiny car rolls out into the arena.  A clown gets out, then another and another until 10 clowns have climbed out.  They start doing tricks and fooling around and the whole crowd is cracking up.  Then the lead clown speaks to the crowd and starts telling jokes.  Eventually, he asks who is sitting in seat #13.  The boy looks down and realizes that he’s in seat 13. He stands up and waves his hands and the clown points at the boy and says “You’re a horses ass!” and the whole crowd points and laughs.  The boy is devastated and runs out of the arena.

For days the boy mopes around until finally his parents, being worried about his state of mind decide to take him to a therapist.  After the first session the therapist pulls the dad to the side and explains that the boy is broken-hearted because he’d never been insulted like that and didn’t know how to respond.  The therapist recommended a school that specialized in comebacks, that maybe that would restore the boy’s confidence.  The father agreed.

The boy enrolled in the comeback school and quickly realized that he was a natural.  With his gifts he quickly became the head of his class.  He did so well that he wound up going to comeback high school, and then into comeback college.  He was even accepted into a prestigious post-grad program, where he got his PhD in comebacks.  He was an adult, and ready to take on the world.

He finally got his opportunity when he saw a flyer announcing that the circus was coming to town.  He couldn’t wait.  A couple of weeks and he’d finally get his chance.  The big day arrives and he gets to the circus early, front row seats, #13 just like he’d planned.  He got his soda and peanuts too.

The circus hadn’t changed much.  First came the jugglers, then the lion tamers, elephants and stunt riders.  Then came the clown car.  Out of the car came the clowns, one after another.  They did their gags and tricks and then the lead clown starts talking to the crowd, telling his jokes.  Finally, he asks who is sitting in seat 13.  The man stands up and confidently shouts “I am.”  The clown points at him and says “You’re a horses ass!”  As the crowd looks at the man he points back and shouts “FUCK YOU CLOWN!”",Comeback school,4

Mary blushed furiously as she stood up. Then replied, “Sir, how dare you ask such a question? I will complain to my parents, who will complain to the principal.”

The male teacher was taken aback at first by Mary’s reaction. Then, as understanding dawned on him, he called for another pupil, this time a volunteer.

Lilly put up her hand. “Yes, Lilly?” asked the teacher.

“Sir, the correct answer is the iris of the eye.”

“Very good. Thanks, Lilly,” said the male teacher.

Very good. Thanks, Lilly,” said the male teacher.

He then turned to the 1st girl, who threatened to complain to her parents and principal: “Well, Mary, I have 3 things to tell you:

First, you have NOT done your HOMEWORK.

Second, you have a DIRTY mind.

And thirdly, I fear, one day in future, you are going to be sadly disappointed!”",School,22

But June had always felt as though there was something between them, something holding them back- something that April was keeping a secret.

As time went by, June got the impression that April was drifting away, and becoming colder. With every day, it felt as though the gap between them grew wider and wider. June had a suspicion as to what the cause might be- a little hussy by the name of May, who lived on the way from April's home to June's. June had seen the way May always made eyes at April when they walked past... she always looked smug, as though she knew something June didn't.

One day, the paranoia became simply too much for June. With nowhere else to turn, June enlisted the help of August, a private investigator, to track April's movements, and find out if there really were some grounds to June's fears.

August, a diligent detective, set about the task immediately, watching April night and day. No single action, no matter how trivial, escaped August's notice. Each detail was meticulously recorded in a journal.

One day, about a week later, there was a knock at June's door. Nervous to the point of shaking, June opened the door to find August, journal in hand, and with a solemn expression.

""I have bad news, June...""

""What? What is it?"" June panicked, grabbing August by the collar. ""Tell me!""

""I... don't know how to say this, June... I'm sorry. Read the last entry...""

With a grimace, August handed June the notebook, already open to the most recent page. June's eyes scanned down the rows of neat notes, to the very last ones, listed as occuring just 20 minutes prior:

April showers.

He tells the monks about his situation, and how he can't call for a mechanic at those hours of the night, so he asks them if he can stay the night in the monastery. The monks happily agree, and give him a room with a bed to sleep on.

In the middle of the night, the man wakes up hearing a strange noise. He follows the noise and sees that its source is a strange door made of wood, but it's locked. The following morning, the monks give the man breakfast and fix his car. He thanks the monks and asks them:

""Honorable monks, I cannot thank you enough for your generosity, but I must ask you a question. Last night I heard a strange noise coming from behind a locked wooden door, and I'm dying to know what the source of the noise is.""

The leader of the monks responds:

""We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.""

The man thanks the monks again and leaves disappointed. A year goes by, and the man coincidentally breaks down in front of the same monastery. He knocks on the door again and they greet him as an old friend, giving him once again a bed to sleep on. In the middle of the night, the man hears the same strange noise, and follows it again to see it's coming from the same wooden door, which is still locked. In the morning, the monks once again gave him breakfast and fixed his car, and as he was about to leave the man once again implored the monks to know what was behind the wooden door:

""Thank you once again, kind monks. It has been one whole year and I still wonder what the source of the strange noise is, as I've heard it again last night.""

The monks all look at each other and cackle. The leader once again steps forward and tells the man:

""We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.""

The man leaves frustrated once again, and doesn't stop thinking about the strange noise for months. Two years later, the man coincidentally breaks down in front of the monastery once again, and once again the monks give him shelter. The man hears the strange noise in the night again, and in the morning asks the monks:

""Please, kind monks. I must know the source of the noise, I beg you.""

The monks explain to the man once again:
.
""We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.""

The man asks them what he has to do to become a monk. They tell him he must travel the world and count all the leaves in the world's trees, all the blades in the world's grass, all the grains of the world's sand, and all the drops of water in the world's oceans. He must return with the exact number, and only then will he become a monk and be able to learn the source of the sound.

The man sets out on his quest to become a monk, and 65 years later returns to the monastery as an old man.

""I have traveled the world,"" he said. ""I have counted every leaf in the trees, every blade of grass, every grain of sand, and every drop in the ocean. There are 1572794709088 leaves in the world's trees, 3651870612479 blades of grass in the world, 6810379165872 grains of sand in the world, and 10752899766394 drops of water in the world's oceans.""

""Congratulations,"" the leader of the monks said. ""You are now a monk. Please, come with us.""

The monks took the man to an initiation ceremony. They gave him his robes and shaved all his hair. The man requested to be taken to the wooden door to learn the source of the strange sound, so the monks took him and gave him the key. The man opened the wooden door, just to find a door made of stone behind it. He asked for the key to the stone door, and the monks gave it to him. He opened the stone door to find a door of coal behind it.

One by one, the man kept unlocking and opening doors. After the door of coal he found a door of glass, then a door of iron, then a door of steel, then a door of bronze, then a door of silver, then a door of ruby, then a door of sapphire, then a door of emerald, then a door of gold, then a door of platinum, then a door of diamond, and finally a door of obsidian.

""This is the final door,"" said the leader of the monks. ""Behind it you will find the source of the strange sound.""

The monks handed the man the key to the door of obsidian and, as he opened it, the man finally found the source of the strange sound...

**Helen:** Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Helen. With me today is quite a frustrated-looking Neil. Neil, what are you doing to that mobile phone?  


**Neil:** Argh, I can't get it to make a phone call. It does everything else: it takes photos, it connects to the internet, it even irons my shirts but it won't make a call!  


**Helen:** Your mobile phone irons your shirts?  


**Neil:** No, not really, but honestly it does everything apart from the one thing I want it to do – make a phone call. It's a joke!  


**Helen:** A joke? But you're not laughing. It can't be a very funny joke.  


**Neil:** Well if you say something is a joke in English it can also mean that it's not very good or not worthy of respect.  


**Helen:** Yes, 'joke' has a second meaning.

Example:

* *The investigation into police corruption was a complete joke. Everyone knows the officers were taking money but they were let off.*
* *The weather forecast was a total joke. It said it would be warm and sunny but it's freezing and raining.*

**Helen:** As you heard there in the example, the person described an investigation into police corruption as a joke. This doesn't mean it was funny. It means it wasn't serious. Also the weather forecast was so bad it was described as a joke.  


**Neil:** Notice that you can add words before 'joke' to make the meaning even stronger. It's a complete joke.  


**Helen:** A complete joke.  


**Neil:** It's a total joke.  


**Helen:** A total joke.  


**Neil:** It's an absolute joke.  


**Helen:** Anyway Neil, why don't you just read the instructions for your new mobile phone? Then you'll probably be able to work out how to make a call.  


**Neil:** I looked at the instructions but they're an absolute joke.  


**Helen:** Oh really?  


**Neil:** Well for a start they are in about 17 languages apart from English.  


**Helen:** What a joke!  


**Neil:** Yeah I know.  


**Helen:** Well we've heard lots of jokes in today's programme but there hasn't been much laughing.  


**Neil:** Argh, what a useless piece of …  


**Helen:** Let's hope Neil finally works out how to use his phone.

The lady immediately scoops up the orphan puppy and says, “Well, we have to keep him!”, as they get back into the car. 

A few minutes down the road, she turns to her husband and says, “Oh, Bill! This poor thing is freezing!”

“Put it between your legs, honey and warm him up”, Bill says. 

The wife replies, “Oh, but it’s soaking wet and smells awful!”

Bill replies, “Well, just hold it’s little nose; it’ll get used to it.”",A man and woman are driving down the road...,10

2) she wants to be 18 years old again

3) she wants her faithful tomcat, Tiger, to be turned into a healthy 19 year old human male

After she finishes asking for her wishes, the fairy bursts in a bright flame and disappears.

The woman is blinded for a short while but soon she can see again and realises that all her wishes have been granted.

She sees on the floor that there is a large open chest with stacks of money in it.

Looking to the mirror on the wall, she is thrilled to see she is now youthful and very beautiful and she also realised that she is feeling very frisky indeed.

Finally she looks to where her cat was sleeping by the fire and amazed, she sees that he is now the most handsome man she has ever seen.

Slowly he stretches and then smoothly stands up in one cat like flowing motion and looks intently into her eyes. 

Her heart starts to race and she noticed that his eyes are the same bright orange that they used to be when he was a cat.

Tentatively, worried she might break the wishes, she say, “Hi Tiger, how are you feeling?”

Tiger continues to stare at her for a few more seconds and then he says, “Well ducky, I bet you’re feeling really stupid that you got me fixed all those years ago!”",An old woman was sitting next to her fire one day when suddenly a spark jumped out and turned into a fairy.,220

The whole town appeared empty, except for one building near a church. He entered and it was an enormous and lively room and the whole town appeared to be there. There was beer and food and people seemed to be enjoying themselves a lot.He went to the bar in one corner and asked for a beer for himself as he was tired and requested from the barman what was going on.

""Well, we are a pretty small town, so, it makes sense for us to all be in the same place after work to talk to each other, this way you can talk to anyone, because everyone is in the same place.""

""It makes sense"", said the traveller, sipping his beer.

But every once in a while, someone would stand up and yell a number ""17"" and crowd would jump into laughter.

Some minutes pass and then another one ""34"" and rolls of laughter, then another one shouts ""12"" and even more laughs.

He turns back to the bartender ""Another thing, what is with all the number shouting?""

""Well, as I said, we are a pretty small town and very people pass by, so we pretty much know all each others jokes already. So we actually just came up with a numbering system and instead of telling the whole joke, we just repeat the number, people remember it and we laugh.""

""OK. It makes sense as well."", said the traveller, sipping his beer.

A few more rounds of number shouting, and then, someone stands up and shout ""8"", but there is almost no reaction from the crowd.

The traveller, puzzled, turns to the bartender ""So what about joke number 8, is it not funny?""

The bartender responds, ""Well, there are people that know how to tell jokes and who don't know how to tell jokes.""

A firefighter was working on the engine outside the Station, when he noticed a little  girl nearby in a little red wagon with little ladders hung off the sides and a garden  hose tightly coiled in the middle.  The girl was wearing a firefighter's helmet.  The wagon was being pulled by her dog and her cat.  The firefighter walked over to take a closer look. 'That sure is a nice fire truck,' the  firefighter said with admiration.  'Thanks,' the girl replied. The firefighter looked a little closer. The girl had tied the wagon to her dog's collar and to the cat's testicles.  'Little partner,' the firefighter said, 'I don't want to tell you how to run your rig,  but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go faster. '  The little girl replied thoughtfully, 'You're probably right, but then I wouldn't have a  siren.",Little Firefighter,22

'How am I supposed to support my family without our only source of income?', he exclaims. In utter disbelief he walks to the shed, grabs his shotgun, and Kurt Cobains himself next to the cow.

Hearing the shot, his wife steps outside. Upon witnessing the horror in the meadow, she loses it and decides she can't live without her husband. She grabs the shotgun and ends her live, right next to her husband.

The three sons (27, 21 and 16 years old) heard all the turmoil and went outside. Staring in disbelief at the massacre, they discuss what they should do. Suddenly, *poof* a pixie appears.

""I can bring your parents back."", it tells the oldest son. ""All you need to do, is fuck me ten times in a row. Be wary though, should you fail, I'll take your life aswell.""

The oldest son hesitates for a while, but then decides it's the only way. He manages to fuck the pixie a marvelous seven times in a row, but then tuckers out. The pixie relentlessly takes his life.

""I'll bring your whole family and the cow back, if you fuck me twenty times in a row!"", she tells the middle son. ""You're younger, your stamina should be higher than your brother's.""

The middle son drinks the last gallon of milk their beloved cow gave them and puts the pixie to work. He gives it a run for its money. A 17-turn strike of unrelenting pounding later, he has to give up. The pixie is unmoved, and takes his life as well.

The pixie glares at the youngest son and says: ""You know the deal, but since the stakes ar higher than ever, you'll have to fuck me 50 times. If you succeed, I'll bring everyone back.""

""50 times?"", the youngest repeats calmly. ""I'm not sure you'd survive that."" 

The pixie, now intrigued, asks: ""Why wouldn't I survive that?""

""Well.... the cow didn't...""","A farmer with one cow lives in a tiny farm with his wife, and three sons.",221

Tina comes in and says she's cooking me breakfast but I tell her there's no time for food and I really have to go. This goes back and forth as she's pretty persistent.

One day this feller gets a call from his brother ""Bill"" (a metrosexual) who asked him to take care of his cat while he went on a business trip. The brother ""Larry"" (a Marine) agreed and Bill came over and dropped off the cat and a very long list of instructions.  It took Bill two days to get to his business conference and as soon as he checked in he called Larry and asked about his cat. Larry informed him that the cat was dead, (having gotten out of the house onto the roof and fallen)....
Bill was devastated!  He immediately started crying and told Larry that he was an inconsiderate brother for telling him so abruptly that his friend the cat had died so suddenly.   Larry responds with, ""How should I have told you?"".   Bill comes back with the fact that on the first day that he called Larry should have told him that his cat kept getting out on the roof despite his best efforts, the next day he could have explained to Bill that the cat had gotten out and fallen off the roof, but that he had taken him to the vet and he was under observation, and on the third day Larry should have told him that the cat died peacefully in his sleep.
Bill then asked Larry how their Mom was doing, and Larry says, "" Well Mom  keeps getting out on the roof despite my best efforts....""",His cat died......,17

post,fddjek,2qh72,jokes,false,1583331063,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fddjek/tales_of_yuri/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Yuri.

Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",Tales of Yuri,18

My wonderful Italian girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married.
 
There was only one little thing bothering me....It was her beautiful younger sister. 

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight mini skirts, and generally was bra-less.
 
She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view.
 
It had to be deliberate.
 
Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.

One day her 'little' sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations.
 
She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome.
 
She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.
 
Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.
 
She said, 'I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.'
 
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.
 
I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.
 
I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.

Lo... And behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!
 
With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law put down his shotgun and hugged me and said, 'We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.'

So there were 3 merchants,



They went to a distant land that had no hotel

So, they kept walking until they found a kings castle. Once they entered the castle, they asked the king if they can sleep one night in his glorious castle.  He accepted but with ONE condition.

""none of you can sleep with my daughter. If you do, you will be executed on the spot.""

So the next morning, all 3 merchants were summoned to the king.

King: ok i know all 3 of you bitches slept with my daughter last night. I should execute every single one of you right here and now. However, i will give you each one chance to redeem yourselves. Go get 10 pieces of the same fruit. 

So they all went. The first came back with 10 apples.

King: now, to redeem yourself, stick all 10 of thoes apples up your arse, and if you make a single sound, whether its laughing or groning, or any other sound, ill kill you on the spot.

So the first got through about half of the first one then started screaming out in pain. So the king killed him, and he went heaven. 

Second came along and brought 10 grapes. Easy right? He got through 9 then bursted out LAUGHING, NOT PAIN. when he died and got to heaven, the 1st asked the 2nd:

Yo how did u fail that? It was so easy!

Second replied:
