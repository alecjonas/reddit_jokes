Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""

Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""

Harry: ""Pants.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong...",What Starts with F and ends with K?,59

He goes to a brothel a friend had told him about and selects a girl of his liking. She takes him to a room and right before he's about to make love to this striking beauty, she turns out the lights. 

Things are going well for the man. In fact, she's shouting in Japanese since the moment he's entered her. Encouraged by her cries of delight he pumps harder, listening to these Japanese words of ecstasy she has been repeating over and over. Finally he finishes, pays a steep fee, and leaves very satisfied.

The next day, he goes to a golf outing with some of the businessmen he went to the country to meet with.

It's his turn and he's on the green, he lines up, puts, and just barely makes it in!

Hoping to impress his Japanese companions, he shouts the same foreign words he'd heard the girl last night repeating.

Turning around, all he saw were looks of confusion from his hopeful clients.

The president of the Japanese company then looks at him and says, ""What you mean, wrong hole?""",A man went to Japan on business,41

His walk happens to take him through the local farmer's market, where a chef had set up a booth to make the freshest seafood he could.  
  
As the old man walked by, the chef pulled a still living fish out of a tank of water and set it on his cutting board. He raised the knife, when the old man stopped him.  
  
""What do you think you're doing?""  
  
""Well, I'm making seafood,"" the chef replied. ""I can't exactly cook the food if it's still alive.""  
  
""That fish deserves another lease on life. How much are you going to sell the meal for?""  
  
""$12.""  
  
""Tell you what, I'll give you $20 if you give me the fish, alive.""  
  
Never one to turn down a profit, the chef hands him the fish in a pail of water. The old man nods, then turns and walks to the nearest bridge over water.  
  
""It's a good thing I came by!"" the old man said as he tossed the fish off the bridge and into the river.
  
The next day, the old man is out on his walk again. And once again, he walks through the market at the same time. He passed by the chef, just as he was halfway through butchering a fish.  

""You're at it again!?"" the old man yelled.  
  
""I've been doing this all day, sir. It's just what a chef does!""  
  
The old man pointed to the bucket. ""Gimme the next fish, he's gonna live to see another day. I'll give you $20.""  
  
And again, the chef gave him the fish, which the old man tossed into the river. Realizing the business opportunity that had presented itself, the chef hatched a plan: every day at the same time, he would make sure to be working on fish. And sure enough, for weeks, the old man would give him $20 to ""save"" one fish.  
  
Weeks had gone by, and the chef noted the time, and saw the old man coming. He reached for a fish, but to his shock, he was all out. He quickly glanced around to see what was nearby, but all that was there were some diners with their baby. Panicking, he grabbed the baby out of the stroller and put it on the cutting board.  
  
As the old man got to the chef, his eyes widened. ""What is THIS?!?""  
  
Realizing just what he had done, the chef nervously coughed. ""W-well, a customer wanted it, and, erm, the customer is always right, so...""  
  
""How much are they paying you to cook them a goddamn baby?!?!""  
  
""Uh... $100?""  
  
The old man pulled out his money clip and took out two crisp $100 bills. ""Here, I'll give you $200.""  
  
He threw the money down on the table, then picked up the baby, cradling it gently in his arms as he walked away.

A farmer decides he needs a new rooster so he can expand his chicken coop, so he buys the most virile one he can find and names him Brewster. Within a day, Brewster has impregnated every hen the farmer owns.

The next day, the farmer awakes to a huge ruckus coming from his turkey pen. He goes out to defend his turkeys, only to find Brewster furiously attempting to fuck every turkey he owns, sending them into a panic. The farmer grabs the rooster by the neck and pulls him away, saying ""Brewster, you horny rooster, keep this up and it's gonna kill you!"".

The very next day, the farmer awakes to angry honking. Running over to where the geese are kept, he sees a storm of feathers as Brewster vigorously humps every goose that isn't attacking him. The farmer jumps in and yanks Brewster away, yelling ""Brewster, you horny rooster, keep this up and it's gonna kill you!"".

The next day, all seems quiet. The farmer goes out to inspect his animals only to see a small figure laying motionless in the hot sun. He walks over to see that it's Brewster, tongue lolling out of his beak in the dust. The farmer sighs and says ""I tried to tell you, Brewster, you horny rooster, what did you try to fuck now?""

A black solider has dug in and is on the front line in a foxhole.  The Indian is out patrolling to make contact with the enemy.  The two soldiers come across one another and hold their ground.  There's obviously an inability to verbally communicate, so the black soldier decides to try and use hand signals.

The black soldier tries first and moves his fingers forward along the ground asking the Indian if he is on ground patrol.  The Indian looks confused and doesn't understand.

The black soldier tries again and moves his fingers in a downward motion asking the Indian if he is on air patrol.  The Indian looks even more confused now.  

So the black solider figures he must be foxhole/front line patrol like himself and sticks his finger in and out of his open fist.  The Indian sees this and takes a step back, starting to look anxious.

No communication is working, so the black solider decides to try one more time.  He makes a binoculars gestures with his hands asking if he is on observation.  The Indian, who's about to freak out by now, does a complete 180 and runs are fast as possible back into the woods where he came from.

The Indian gets back to camp sweating and nervous as hell.  His tribal chief approaches and asks if he happened to make contact with the enemy.  The Indian replied ""Yes, I did.  I met a crazy black solider in a foxhole who told me when the people run away and the sun goes down he's going to fuck me in the ass until my eyes pop out"".

3) The *actual* first person to invent language was pissed because he thought of it but didn't say anything.

3.5) He didn't say anything because he was trying to invent patent law first.

4) The first person to invent language probably bragged about it for days.

5) The first person to invent language was probably high as *fuuuck.* ""Yo, what if I could make other people think what I'm thinking by vibrating the air around me.""

6) The first person to hear language probably thought he was high as fuck. ""Dude, am I reading minds right now? Also, what's reading?""

7) The first person to invent guns probably made a killing.

7.5) Isn't it funny that making a killing is an idiom for making money. Hmm... what does that say, United States Military? And no hitting in class, what did Iraq do to you anyway? He knocked down your lego building? Are you sure that wasn't Osama? Shit, it'll always be too soon for 9-12 jokes. (9-10? It was soo long ago)

8) The first person to invent language probably got tired of repeating himself all damn day.

Nine) The first principle of language design is make things that people say often as easy to say as possible. The zeroth principle is encode the most important things in the grammar itself. The negative first principle is to put the most important information at the front.

10) The first person to invent writing probably thought he was talking to idiots. *Do I have to spell it out for you.*

11) It used to be the case that the ability to read-in-one's-head was really rare. Now it's kinda the other way round. Just thought it was interesting. There's no joke, stop trying to figure it out. *Or is there?*

12) The first person to invent language probably wanted to tell a joke. Or woo a girl. Or make a promise. Or stand out. Or warn someone. Aww, aren't humans awesome? (Really!) But fundamentally, they wanted to share information, i.e, sex.

12.5) I know what i.e. and e.g. mean, i just wanted to show you you're super pedantic. We'll get along nicely. (Also, it was part of the joke!)

13) The second person to talk probably thought he was *soooo* original. The third person to talk said ""Repost!""

14) Language is cool, but it still can't express everything that needs to be expressed. I'm gonna go invent a *real* language.

I don’t even know if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and that seems to bring him happiness.

I don’t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the…in the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch… I no longer love him. As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I… that I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn’t such a coward, then perhaps…perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all…Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I’m a moth, just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me.

""Our tribe has lasted for many, many seasons."" he says, ""Mainly due to our chiefs being able to make changes to benefit our tribe. I have decided that during **my** reign, all or our prisoners will be informed of what will happen to them, and be able to choose their own fate accordingly.""

&amp;nbsp;

""So, in keeping with this ruling, I have to tell you that we are going to kill you, eat your flesh, and use your skin to make our canoes. Each of you will be able to choose the manner of your death, to make it easier upon yourself.""

The Frenchman considers this for a moment. After thinking, he says ""Hand me a knife."" Having been bound by his own rules, the chief motions for a close tribesman to give the man a knife.

&amp;nbsp;

Without a moments hesitation, the Frenchman holds the knife aloft and yells ""**I DIE FOR FRANCE!**"" and slashes his own throat, then dies, bleeding out on the rainforest floor.

The chief turns to the Spaniard. ""It is your turn."" he says. ""How do you choose to die?

Without hesitation, the Spaniard says ""That man died a brave death. I shall do the same."" The chief gestures for the Spaniard to be given a knife, and upon receiving it, the man immediately holds it aloft, yells ""**I DIE FOR SPAIN!**"", slashes his own throat, and dies, bleeding out on the rainforest floor.

&amp;nbsp;

The chief then turns to the American. ""You are the last of your friends alive."" he says. ""They have both died honorable, brave deaths. How shall you?""

The American thinks for a little while. He paces, hand on his chin, deep in thought. For close to 10 minutes he paces, until the chief has lost his patience.

""Yeah, I'm sure. Toss it here, and let's get this over with."" the American says.

&amp;nbsp;

The chief, still a bit flustered, gestures for the closest tribesman to toss the man a fork. Upon seeing it done, the chief sits back, perturbed.

&amp;nbsp;

The American stares at the fork, hand still on his chin. Just as the chief is about to give the order for the other tribesmen to slaughter him for delaying his fate, the American holds the fork high.

In particular, it turns out to matter a lot which relations and processes are routinely thought about as things with characteristics of their own, and which can be discussed only as characteristics of other things. For example, it's a lot easier to say ""addition is commutative"" than to have to spell it out as a property of numbers, and it's harder still if you can't talk about numbers as existing independently of particular collections of things. One of the interesting findings of intellectual history is that, when a society is gaining new ways of solving problems and undergoing an upheaval in how people think, circumlocutions that have been around longer are replaced with new nouns first, then more and more recent ones, until explicit ways of talking about abstract entities have caught up with what's being discussed indirectly. This observation is encapsulated in a saying: ontology recapitulates philology.",Abstruse verbiage,1

He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket. All he needed to do was somehow get to the airport, and then he'd be home-free. 
So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc... 
The cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!'' 
So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight. 
One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. 
The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. 
The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?
''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.
''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''
''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.'' 
The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.
When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' 
The cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.''

Sweat and muscle. And he's good; with the able assistance of his manager, he's rising steadily in the ranks.

In fact he's so good, that he decides he can do it - he asks his manager to set up a title fight with The Champ.

""No way,"" the manager says. ""Impossible. You just ain't ready.""
""I am ready chief, I just know I am! I can do it!""
""No,"" the manager replies, ""you can't. The Champ has his signature move, the 'Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press'. You know this. It's so painful, that anybody he catches in it, bang! That's their career over. Nobody has ever escaped it. Forget it!""

But the wrestler won't forget it. He keeps on and on at his manager until the old man is at the end of his rope. Finally, he cracks.

""OK,"" he says, ""you asked for it. A shot at The Champ. Well, you're getting it! But listen up; he WILL get you into his Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press, and when he does I ain't waitin' around. I throw in the towel the instant you're in the Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press and maybe we can still save your career!""

""I won't let you down, Chief!"" the wrestler assures him. ""He won't get ME into any Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press!""

The big night comes, the wrestler's hubris makes him careless and the manager's worst fear is realized: The Champ gets our boy into the Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press in the first minute!

The wrestler's face is a beetroot mask of agony; the Manager goes to throw in the towel, only to find it gone. He left it in the dressing room!

He sprints to go grab it, but just as he makes the dressing room he hears the sound of a bell and a massive cheer shakes the building. It's all over. He takes a seat and waits for the wrestler to reappear, which he does - staggering into the room.

""I told you kid,"" the Manager says. ""I warned you about the Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press. It's all over.""

""I won,"" the Wrestler says. The Managers eyes pop.

""Won? What do you mean, 'won'? You can't have won! He had you! He had you in the Double-Spread-Eagle-Toe-Hold-Triple-Leg-Press! I saw it, with these eyes!""

""Oh, he did,"" replies the wrestler. ""and it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. He had me folded over, bent backwards - but just as I was about to black out, I saw it.""

""Saw what?""

""A big pair of nuts hanging right in front of my face, just swinging there. So I bit them!""

""You - bit...?""

""Yep! Champed my teeth right down on those suckers! And then it was easy - I just stood up, threw him down and got him into a simple half-Nelson. He never stood a chance.""

post,3khahs,2qh72,jokes,false,1441931643,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3khahs/once_long_ago_there_were_two_nation/,self.jokes,,"The nation called Archimedal was in the west, with rich resources and beautiful forests and rivers and mountains. The nation of Newtonia, in the east, was much more industrialized. They had factories and cities, and all their forests had been razed for lumber. They were at war with each. Archimedal wished to learn the industrial techniques of Newtonia, and Newtonia longed to acquire the vast resources of Archimedal. Unfortunately, between the two nations was the vast Sea of Hyperbola. The only possible way to get from one nation to the other was by boat. Archimedal couldn’t create good enough boats to get to all the way to the other side, and Newtonia had to few resources to use its industry to construct warships. Fortunately for both, right in the middle of the Sea of Hyperbola, was the large island Pythag. It was miles wide, with rivers and lakes and forests and beaches and even a mountain. The mountain was on the northern end of the island, and, growing at the very tippy-top, was the tallest oak tree anyone had ever seen. It was so tall it could be seen from the shores of both Archimedal and Newtonia, as far away as they were. Both nations wanted the island as a base, so as to be able to sail from there and then onto the other nation. The two kings of Archimedal and Newtonia rallied their forces and sent them off the claim the island. Archimedal sent 15,000 knights, with all their squires and cooks and armorers off to fight, while Newtonia sent their entire army of 25,000 Knights, with all their retainers and wives and squires and even the peasantry that lived in the lands held by the knights. All in all, Archimedal sent a total of 100,000 people off to conquer the island, and Newtonia sent 300,000. Meanwhile, as the two nations were filling their ships with food and drink and livestock, the knight of the island of Pythag, was watching the two massing armies. Unbeknownst to either nation, the Island of Pythag was a sacred place, as designated by the Great Spirit Hoken. The Knight of Pythag had been stationed on the island to help protect it from invaders. This noble knight was all alone on the island, except for his single squire, a young lad, barely having reached the age of 16. It was this boy that had first seen the rallying troops, as he patrolled the edges of the island on his daily route. As soon as he saw them, he rushed to the knight. “Sir!” he exclaimed, “The two surrounding nations are preparing for war, with us in between. I fear they may try to claim the island as a means of providing support.” The old knight, having known for some time this would happen, simply said to his squire, “It need not concern you, if you but do what I ask. You must take our cooking pot, and this rope, and put them in your traveling pack. Take care you do not lose either one, for if you do, all hope is lost.” The squire took the rope and the pot and placed them gently in his pack. “What will this accomplish, sir?” he asked. “By themselves, nothing,” said the knight, “Which is why that was merely the first step in the journey of protecting this island. Next, you must take the rope and the pot up to the northern part of the island, where you will find the island mountain. Up to the top you must climb, and what a perilous climb it will be. Howling winds and wild wolves and paths blocked by rocks and ice could all try to prevent you from reaching the summit. You must not let them. For once you reach the top, you will find the tallest oak tree you have ever seen.  You must climb to the top of that tree, with the pot and rope and tie the pot to the very top branch using a noose. You must be very sure to tie it very tight, and it has to be a noose, no square knots or bowline knots. Once you have done that, look to the east, then look to the west. You should see a large eagle flying about the tree. Grab onto one of his legs, and use it to descend swiftly to the bottom of the mountain. Then, quickly make your way back to our camp so we can prepare to defend the island.” The squire had no idea how this would help, but knowing how wise the old knight was, he started on his journey. It was a long journey. He climbed hills and forded rivers. He felled trees and hunted deer for food. Many days past. Luckily, both the Nation of Archimedal and the Nation of Newtonia had very slow moving ships, and they were very far away. On his way to the bottom of the great hill, the young squire saw an owl flying overhead. When he finally made it to the bottom of the great mountain, he saw a long, winding path leading up to the top. He climbed and he climbed and he climbed all day. But in the end, he had made little progress up the side of the mountain. As he was laying down to sleep that night, he heard a rumbling noise. He looked up. There was an avalanche headed down the mountain side, right for him! He quickly scrambled to gather up his things, taking particular care to grab the cooking pot and rope before dashing back down the hill. Mid-way down, he stumbled and began rolling. Down and down he rolled, until he hit the bottom of the hill. As he stumbled up and began running away from the avalanche, a single tear rolled down his cheek. He would have cried more, but he knew that he had to be strong. He had to find a new way up the mountain, now that the path was covered. Instead of letting himself get some sleep that night, he made his way wearily around the mountain, searching for another path. By the time the sun had risen, he still had found no such path and was forced to conclude that he would have to make his own. So, he set on up the mountain, trying to take the easiest path possible, for he knew it would be a long journey. Up and up he climbed, day after day. Once, he thought he saw the eagle the old knight had spoken of, circling high above his head. But when a tried to look closer, he saw nothing at all. The night he finally made it to a spot half way up the mountain, as he was lying down to go to sleep, he noticed a strange rock on the ground next to him. It was in the shape of a nearly perfect 'H'. For reasons unknown to him, his eyes began to brim. The second tear of the journey fell from the corner of his eye. Maybe it won't be here in the morning, he thought. He told himself to hold it together, and promptly fell asleep. The next morning when he awoke the 'H' stone was still there, not having moved from the night before. Feeling ashamed at having been so dimwitted as to think a rock could move by itself, he began again on his long ascent up the mountain. He passed many dangers going up; snakes and scorpions and wolves and bears. But he wouldn't let any of them frighten him. Until finally, he reached the top of the mountain. There, just as the old knight had said, was the tallest oak tree the squire had ever seen. The young lad wept a third tear as the longest part of his journey was over. Now all he had to do was climb to the top of the tree. He soon found that that was more easily said than done. For while the bark of the tree provided adequate hand and footholds, the sap and branches seemed to cling to him as he climbed, and poked at him and held him back. As he was whipped in the face by a branch for the fifth time, he made up his mind. He was going to finish this climb today, or never. He fought his way boldly through the thick branches on the lower part of the tree, then began to carefully climb the rest of the way, with narrower branches. About half way up, he saw a sparrow resting on a branch on the opposite side of the tree as him. As he watched it, it began to call out in tis song. He listened, then, without so much as a noise, crept over to it to watch it more closely. It sensed his presence, however, and quickly took flight as he neared it. It swooped low down over the trees in the forest, and the squire watched it go. He began to shed his fourth and what would hopefully be final tear of the long hard journey. He was swept with a sense of awe as he gazed at the island he called home. There was so much beauty. He couldn't let it get destroyed by invaders. With renewed strength, he began climbing again. As he reached the top of the tree, he looked out, over the island once again, knowing that he would probably never see this view again. However, knowing that he didn't have all that much time, he quickly slipped the rope and pot out of his pack and tied the rope into a noose around the top most branch of the tree. He hung the pot from the noose, high above the rest of the island. Just as he was checking to make sure the pot was secure, he spotted the eagle the old knight had told him about. Using the old bird languages he had learned form the knight, the young squire called the bird over and grabbed its leg. The bird barely even dipped in the air as the squire clung to it, for it was old and incredibly strong. It knew right were to go. The squire was overjoyed to not have to make his way back across the island as the bird carried him back to the campsite the knight was using. They descended a little rough, but nothing the squire couldn't handle. ""Your back."" said the knight. ""Good. For tomorrow the armies of Archimedal and Newtonia wll land on the island. Did you succeed in your task?"" The squire told him that he had, but he still had no idea how that was suppose to help. The knight did not answer. He merely set about preparing for them a modest dinner of bread and cheese. That night, the squire stirred in his sleep, worrying about the coming battle. When they awoke, it was to the sound of war horns. The time had come to fight. Now, this wasn't exactly the most important battle ever, and knights were of royal blood, which nobody wanted to spill. So the knights sent out their squires to battle for them. The squires of Newtonia rushed forward onto the island near where the old knight and his squire stood, just as the squires of Archimedal did the same on the other side. The old knight quickly got out of the way, leaving his squire to himself. But not before telling him, ""Remember: when things seems darkest, go to the mountain. Look up to the pot."" Still unsure as to how this would help, the squire assured the old knight he would, and told him to stay safe. Then the tides of battle reached the young squire, and he found himself swept up. Both armies were fighting to gain an advantage on the other, and to do that, they had to take the area he was standing on. He couldn't let them do that. He drew his sword and began to try to drive them back, both sides. He quickly grew nearly exhausted from the effort, and yet both armies seemed to limitless. They pushed into the island, far and wide, long into the day. By about 5:00 at night, the squire realized they were on almost the same path he had taken to the mountain. They were driving him there! He couldn't let them get there. If the did, they would win. He could not hold them off ot the entire mountain. With this thought, he felt some of his strength come back and he began fighting anew. He manage to drive the armies back a few feet, but seemed that for every five feet he drove them back, they drove him another 12, or 13 feet the other way. As dusk fell, he nearly stumbled to ground, knowing how difficult his fight would be in the dark. But he held his strength, for he knew he must not lose this battle. They fought all through the night, long and hard. Then, just before dawn, the squire stepped back and felt a rise under his foot. The mountain. They had driven him all the way there. He nearly lost all courage then and there. But then he remembered the old knights words: ""When things seem darkest, go to the mountain. Look up to the pot."" Well, didn't people always say it was darkest before the dawn? He chanced a look up the mountain. Just as he did so, the sun broke over the top of it. It shined in all its glory. The two armies were both blinded by the light as the young squire looked up at the pot he had hung from the noose, way up high. He found himself filled with a new strength, a stronger strength. Suddenly his sword didn't seem so heavy, and his eyes not quite so tired. And the legends of Newtonia and Archimedal say he fought with the strength of 10,000 men, holding both of the armies at by all by himself. So ferociously did he fight that the opposing armies fled and sailed back to there own lands, never attempting to take the island again. When the battle was over, the young squire returned to the old knight, who as sitting in there camp. ""What happened to me?"" he asked, for he was beyond a clue. ""Think it through,"" said the knight, ""think it through and it will come to you."" The squire sat and thought, and sat and thought some more. Until finally, he jumped to his feet, one last tear in his eye, as he said, ""I've got it! I know what happened."" The old Knight smiled at him, and said, ""So now you know it is true that the squire of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squire of the other two sides.

The dog has a note in his mouth, with a $10 bill attached. 

The butcher bends down and picks the note out of the dog's mouth, reading aloud he says: ""2 pork chops please"" and the dog sits.

The butcher, highly impressed, packages two pork chops for the dog, wraps them up and gives the bag to the dog who picks it up and exits the shop.

The butcher was so blown away that he decided he was going to follow this dog on his journey home, and closed up shop.

With the butcher following on the way home, the dog stopped at a stop sign and waited for traffic.

The dog got to a stop light which was red, he waited for it to turn green before crossing the street.

The butcher couldn't believe what he was seeing.

Dog stopped at a bus stop, a bus bus pulled up with the dog remained on the bench. When the next bus came the dog got on and, so did the butcher.

After about five or six stops, the dog reaches his destination and him and the butcher exit the bus.

The butcher follows the dog 1 or 2 more streets around the corner, and stops short of the house at the end of the driveway.

So the dog walks up to the door, he sets the pork chops down and scratches at the door. Nobody answers the door.

The dog stood on his hind legs and scratched harder on the door. No answer.

Frustrated, the dog goes to the side of the house and uses his paw to tap on the window. He goes back to the front door, but nobody answers.

The dog begins to become frantic, and starts to hurl his body at the door slamming into it as loud as possible. He slams and slams and slams.

After about a minute of this, finally somebody opens the door. The dog's owner was not happy to see him, he immediately started to yell and hit the dog, calling him a complete idiot.

The butcher, who is all this happening, ran up the driveway to the owner of the dog to get him to stop. ""No!"" He exclaimed, ""This dog is a genius! I just followed him home, you wouldn't believe what I saw him do to get here!""

""*Oh really?!*"" Says the owner, ""*Well this is the third time he's forgot his keys this week!!*""

Before they go in, St. Peter asks them how did they die. So he asks the first man and the first man says, ""Well I've suspected for a while that my wife had been cheating on me with another man so I came home early from work on purpose. When I got back to the apartement she was lying naked in bed like she had just been having sex. So I checked under the bed and there was no one there. I checked in the closet and there was no one there, so I looked on the balcony and there was some guy hanging from the railing. I got so angry I beat his hands until he fell, then I ran back in the apartement, grabbed the refridgerator, brought it back out, and dropped over the railing right on top of him. Then I was so mad I had a heart attack and died and came here."" St. Peter said, ""It sounds like you've had it rough, so I'll let you in."" 

The next man walks up and gets asked the same question. So this man says, ""I was in my apartement when I slipped and fell over the railing. I was able to grab onto the railing of the apartement below me but then this guy starts pounding on my fists until I fall. Then he goes and dumps this refridgerator on me and I wound up here."" St. Peter lets this guy in too because he has also had it rough. 

Then the third guy comes up and is also asked the question. This guy replies, ""Okay, so I'm banging this married chick when the husband comes home early. So I go and hide in the refrigerator...""

And so they got him a Big Wheel tricycle.


Little Johnny was furious, and so he took the tricycle up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall.


He broke his arm and spent a month in a cast.


A little while later, when he was almost six years old and his parents asked him what he wanted for his birthday.


""I want pink cottonballs!"" little Johnny said firmly.


""No way!"" said his parents, getting a bit angry, ""You're a boy, and that's not a normal present for a boy!""


And so they got him a bicycle.


Little Johnny threw a temper-tantrum when he saw the bicycle and he took it up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall.


He broke his leg and spent three months in a cast.


Some time after that, Johnny was almost ten years old and his parents nervously asked him what he wanted for his birthday.


""I want pink cottonballs!"" wailed Johnny.


""No!"" said his parents, genuinely upset now, ""You ask for that every year, and every year we say no! There will be no pink cottonballs in our house, young man, and that's final!""


And so they got him a really kickass dirt-bike.


Little Johnny, simmering with anger, built a ramp at the bottom of the hill, then he took the dirt-bike up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, hit the ramp, did a sweet 360' freestyle flip in the air, and then **SMASHED** the dirt-bike into a brick wall.


He broke his both his arms and his legs and spent almost six months in traction.


A few years later, right before his 16th birthday, Johnny's parents asked him what he wanted for his birthday.


""Pink cottonballs!"" shouted Johnny. ""Pink cottonballs!"" groaned his parents.


""No! Absolutely not!"" said his parents, putting their foot down, ""This obsession with pink cottonballs is unnatural! It is a disgusting, abnormal request and we will not be a part of it! You'll get a normal gift and you will like it! We mean it this time, buster!""


And so they got him a brand-new Toyota Vios. They even got him a pink one, hoping that would appease him.


But Little Johnny looked at the Vios with pure loathing. Why didn't his parents understand him? Nobody understands him! And so he took the car up to the top of the big hill, he spun a few donuts with it and then he rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall at 60mph.


This time, Little Johnny was seriously hurt. He broke his back and spent most of the next year in a body cast. During that time, his parents hired a therapist to try to cure him of his weird cottonball obsession, but to no avail.


Finally, Little Johnny was all grown up. He was almost 18 and ready to leave the nest and go out on his own in the world. In spite of everything, his parents hoped that this one time, he would ask for a normal gift for his last birthday at home.

""What do you want for your birthday, Little Johnny?"" they asked.


""Mom. Dad. I love you guys. I know we've had our difficulties, but I am just asking you to accept me as I am. I may not be like all the other boys, but I'm still your son. Please, just this once, give me pink cottonballs for my birthday,"" pleaded Little Johnny.


Hearing this, his parents sighed in dismay. Then that dismay turned to anger. ""**NO!!**"" shouted his parents, ""When you are 18, you can move out and buy all the pink cottonballs you want! But while you are living under our roof, you will abide by our rules! We will not enable your deviant lifestyle choices! We are still your parents and you still have to obey us. So there will be **no** pink cottonballs from us, ever!!""


And so they got him a totally pimped out Cadillac Escalade with spinning rims and a sick sound system.


Little Johnny sighed. He wasn't even angry about it any more, but still, he had to be true to himself. So he took the SUV up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall.


But, oh no.... this time, Little Johnny was mortally wounded.


As he lay in his hospital bed, the doctors allowed his parents to speak with him one last time to say their good-byes before he passed away.


When they entered the room, they saw their Little Johnny laying on the bed, broken and battered, and their hearts were filled with regret. Oh why hadn't they listened to their son? If only they had gotten him the present he'd really wanted all those many long years, he'd still be alive. Weird, but alive. At first, they didn't know what to say. How could they apologize for so many years of misunderstanding? But then curiosity overtook their grief.


So his parents leaned over his bed and whispered into his ear, ""Please, Little Johnny, our dear sweet boy. Before you go, we simply must know why. Please tell us, why did you want 'pink cottonballs' for your birthday?""


And Little Johnny, with the last ounce of strength in his body, lifted his head off the pillow, and said:


""Mom.... Dad.... I... I.....""


And he died.

One day while they were sailing, they saw that a pirate ship had sent a boarding party to try and board their ship. The crew  became worried, but the Captain was calm.

He bellowed to his First Mate, ""Bring me my red shirt!""

The First Mate quickly got the Captain's red shirt, which the captain put on. Then he led his crew into battle against the mean pirates. Although there were some casualties among the crew, the pirates were defeated.

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending two boarding parties towards their ship. The crew was nervous, but the Captain,  calm as ever, bellowed, ""Bring me my red shirt!"" And once again the battle was on! 

The Captain and his crew fought off the boarding parties, though this time more casualties occurred.

Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's events when an  ensign looked at the Captain and asked, ""Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?""

The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, explained, ""If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the blood, so you men will continue to fight unafraid."" The men sat in silence. They were amazed at the courage of such a man.

As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command.

The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, 'Bring me my brown pants!!!'
