'Excuse me, Your Holiness,' says the driver, 'Would you please take your seat so we can leave?'

'Well, to tell you the truth,' says the Pope, 'they never let me drive at the Vatican , and I 'd really like to drive today.'

'I'm sorry but I cannot let you do that I'd lose my job! And what if something should happen?' protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.

'There might be something extra in it for you,' says The Pope.

Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 105 mph.

'Please slow down, Your Holiness!!!' pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens. 'Oh, dear God, I'm gonna lose my license,' moans the driver.

The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.

'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher.

The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going a hundred and five.

'So bust him,' says the Chief.

'I don't think we want to do that - he's really important,' said the Cop.

The Chief exclaimed, 'All the more reason!'

'No, I mean really important,' said the cop.

The Chief then asked, 'Who have you got there, the Mayor?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

Chief: 'Governor?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

'Well,' said the Chief, 'Who is it?'

Cop: 'I think it's God!'

Chief: 'What makes you think it's God?'

After a few years, he left his job, his hive, and his family behind, in search of a better life.
He flew for hours until he came to a small Virginia town, on the edge of a forest. He landed, and as he looked around, he saw a poster. It was a campaign ad for mayor. The concept of elections were unknown to him, so he asked a woman who was walking by what it meant. After realizing the concept of democracy was new to him, she explained all she knew. He was fascinated by the concept that anyone could become a leader.
He settled down in that town, and got a job and a small house. He got to know everyone in the town, gaining their trust and respect.
After a few years, he thought back to that election poster. He had loved his new life so far, but he had always wanted more. He felt he was well versed in the workings of human society, so he decided he would run for mayor.
And he won. He had a remarkable knack for politics, and he won by a landslide.
He served as mayor for 8 years, and he served his constituents well. They loved him, and he would have easily won another term, but he had even higher aspirations.
He ran for a seat in the Senate, building an incredible staff and running persuasive, well-made advertisements on TV across the state. And although this election wasn’t as easy as the one for mayor, he still won fairly comfortably.
As a senator, he represented his constituents with pride and dedication. He helped fund projects to better the state’s infrastructure, and played a major part in creating major nationwide policies. But even with all this success, he still wanted more. He had his eyes set on the presidency.
He worked hard to get funding from interest groups and individual donors. He worked harder than he ever had at anything, and his work payed off. He became the first bee president of the United States.
The day after his election, he went back to the town where it had all started, receiving warm greetings from the people that had helped launch his political career in the first place. He walked through the town with a sense of nostalgia, seeing where it had all started. As he walked through the town center, he got a strange craving- for fruit punch. He looked in the town’s only supermarket, and curiously, they were all sold out. He didn’t mind much, though, and continued his walk through the town. And a few minutes later, he saw a small stand, selling many drinks, including fruit punch!
And as the bee walked closer, he discovered that there was no punch line.",There was once a really smart bee.,17

A husband leans over and asks his wife, ""Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer who was walking by, heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence!!""",[NSFW] Senior Sex,226

I swore to my wife that I'd be back at midnight. She didn't believe me, but I still went there.

The meal was very tasty, time flied, my blood was already scarce compared to all of the alcohol and I was extremely drunk. At about 3 AM, I went back home. When I came in and closed the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall said ""cuckoo"" 3 times.

Quickly, thinking that my wife would wake up and have an argument with me, I said ""cuckoo"" 9 more times.

I was really proud of myself for having a great, quick idea, even while I was drunk, to avoid having a conflict with my wife.

The next morning, she asked me what time did I come back home and I said ""midnight"". She didn't seem to distrust me, not even a little.

Then she told me:

\- Honey, we need a new cuckoo for our clock!

When I asked her why, she said:

\- Well, this night the cuckoo said ""cuckoo"" 3 times and said ""GAAAAAAH, I'M SCREWED!"". It said ""cuckoo"" 4 more times, then he grunted and belched. It said ""cuckoo"" 3 more times, farted, crazily laughed and said ""cuckoo"" 2 more times. Then, it hit the door I left ajar and said ""SON OF A B\*\*CH!"", stepped on the cat and said ""SH\*T!"" and only went to bed after falling twice while taking off his clothes.

They were looking for somewhere to pass the night, until they found a little hut, which only had a double bed and a wardrobe with some blankets. The priest asked the nun:

\- Should we sleep here?

\- Yes - the nun answered.

The priest wanted to sleep in bed, while the nun wanted to sleep on the floor.

At one point, the priest was very cold while he was sleeping, but he was too lazy to go and get a blanket. So he asked the nun:

\- Sister, I'm very cold... Can you get me a blanket from the wardrobe, please?

\- Sure! - She went to the wardrobe, took out a blanket and sweetly put it on the bed.

Later, the priest was still cold, so he asked the nun again:

\- Sister, I'm still cold... Would you mind giving me a blanket from the wardrobe?

And, just like before, the nun went to the wardrobe, took out another blanket and gently put it on the bed.

Some minutes later, the priest told the nun:

\- Sister, I'm still cold...

The nun understood his intention, so she asked him:

\- Father, we're the only people here, right?

\- Yes...

\- And, whatever we do, we'll be the only ones to know it, right?

\- Yes...

\- Then I have an idea: let's pretend that we are a husband and a wife! What do you think?

The priest stood up on the bed and started to jump, saying:

\- Yes! Yes! Yes!

After that, the nun put an angry look on her face and shouted:

**- THEN, SH\*T! GET UP, GO TO THE F\*\*\*ING WARDROBE AND GET YOURSELF A F\*\*\*ING BLANKET!**

Then he commanded the women to pass through the gates and move on to the afterlife.

After some time, the men separated themselves out into two lines.  The first line was hundreds of miles long and was the men who were subbordinate to their wives.  The second line only had one man in it.

G-d looked at the two lines and said ""everyone one of you has disappointed me.  You were commanded to be the heads of your household and to lead your women and your familes.  Only one of you actually managed to do that.  You should all look to him as a model and an example.  Surely he shall be truly rewarded.""

Then he turns to the man and says ""please tell everyone how you came to stand by yourself as master of your house.""  The man looks back at the other line, then looks at G-d and says: ""My wife told me to stand here.""

 He was rewarded. And when the other men asked what he was rewarded with, they said he was rewarded with punch. Because there is no punch line in the afterlife.",Meantime in Heaven....,0

After browsing through the dildos for something special, he decided to ask the old guy behind the counter.

The old man said ""We have vibrating dildo, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except...."" and he stoped.

""Except what?"" The man asked.

""Nothing, Nothing.""

""C'mon, tell me! I need something!""

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick'."" The old man reached under the counter, pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbles, and opened it. There lay a very ordinary looking dildo.

The buissness man laughed, and commented that it looked like every other dildo in this shop.

""But you haven't seen what it'll do,"" said the proprietor. H pointed to a door and said, ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook, and started split down the middle, at which point the old man commanded, ""Voodoo dick, back to your box!""

The voodoo dick stoped, floted back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

""I'll take it!"" Said the business man.

The old man said it was not for sale, but finally suurendred ut for 700 dollers in cash. Plesed as punch, the business man gave his wife the gift, explaned that all she had to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy"" if she got lonely, and set off on his business trip.

After a few days, the wife got unbereably horny. Feeling a little foolish, she opened the box and said tentatilvely, ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot out of the box, made a beeline for her croch, and started pumping away. It was fabulous, like nothing she'd ever experienced before, and she lay back and enjoyed the rush of pleasure. After 3 orgasms, she decided she had enough and reached to pull out the dildo. It wouldn't budge. Nothing worked. The voodoo dick was stuck, trusting away. Her husband forgot to tell her how to turn it off. Desprate, she pulled on a skirt, got in the car, and headed for the hospital, nearly fainting with exitement and exhaustion. On the way, another orgasom nearly made her swerve of the road., and to her horror a squad car pulled her over. First the policeman asked for her license. Then, observing her disheveled state, he asked how much she'd had to drink.

Twiching and sweting, she gasped, ""I haven't been drinking, officer. A voodoo dildo is stuck in my pussy, and it won't stop screwing!""

""Sure, lady,"" said the officer after another long look at her. ""Voodoo dick, my ass!""",A man goes on a business trip,160

In the kitchen, are cupboards, and in one of these cupboards are various boxes of cereal. Now, one of these boxes of cereal is a box of Honey Nut Cheerios.


In this box of Honey Nut Cheerios, there is the Cheerio City! Neighboring that, is the Honey Nut Suburb. In one neighborhood of the Honey Nut Suburb, there is a house where Grandfather Cheerio and Little Boy Cheerio live. Grandfather Cheerio is getting stale, and his time is coming soon. On his deathbed, he calls to Little Boy Cheerio, who rushes into the room.


""Little Boy Cheerio! Little Boy Cheerio! My time is coming. All my life, I've wanted to taste the sweet taste of the fruit punch, found in the distant Fridge. Please, Little Boy Cheerio. This is my dying wish. Bring me some fruit punch.""


Little Boy Cheerio thinks this is a strange request, but he's a good Cheerio, and agrees. Down into his room he goes, to retrieve the prize from the box: The grappling hook. From there, he ventured to the highest skyscraper of Cheerio City, and hurls the grappling hook over the edge of the box. Climbing out, he finds his whole world view absolutely shaken. The world is much larger than he knew. But onwards he travels! He climbs down to the bottom of the cupboard, and from there, carefully, onto the counter.


From there he sees, a vast distance of three feet, the Fridge. Two days of hard travel later, Little Boy Cheerio stops rolling along the counter and finds three lines extending from the Fridge. Unsure of where to find the fruit punch, he simply steps into the first line. It's lengthy, but eventually he finds himself at the front. Standing before him is a gallon of milk.


""No fruit punch here, Little Boy Cheerio.""


So he steps into the next line, all the way at the back. He waits, and he waits. It's a long line, surely this must be it! But no, only a 22 ounce bottle of IPA. Before Little Boy Cheerio can get a word out, he's removed from the line. After all, he's only a little boy!


Begrudgingly making his way to the back of the third line, he grumbles. ""This must be it now!"" Feeling like the whole day's passed him by, he finally, finally, makes it to the front, only to find a lemonade pitcher standing there.


Quite frustrated now, Little Boy Cheerio exclaims to the lemonade pitcher. ""Lemonade Pitcher, I've come so far! My Grandfather sent me here, and all he wants is some fruit punch! Where do I find the fruit punch!?""


The lemonade pitcher looks down at Little Boy Cheerio, a sad expression on the glass.


""Oh, Little Cheerio. You poor thing, there is no punch line.""",So there's this house...,5

Don't any of you have any bad habits? You know, confession is good for the soul, and we'd surely build mutual tolerance, knowing what faults we all share. How about it?""

I'm no good with money; and I've got a taste for high living that my salary can't satisfy. Each church I've served at could have paid down their mortgage like you wouldn't believe if not for me and my spendthrift ways.

""In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world drug lords, because no one imagined that a dog would be eavesdropping.
I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years, But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Dublin airport to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired!""
The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the Kerryman how much he wants for the dog.
""Ten quid!"" The owner says.
""£10? But this dog is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""
""Because he's a lying cunt. He's never been out of the garden!""",A Dublin man sees a sign outside a Kerry farmhouse: 'Talking Dog For Sale'....,29

When I woke up and climbed up back to the road i saw a beautiful old cabriolet with a hot brunette sitting in it in a blouse. “According to the size of her tits, I’m probably in Paradise” I thought.

- Are you alright? It looks like you have a couple of bad scratches. I can get you to my place so I can clean and bandage them up.

 - Oh thanks, I’m alright. And my wife will probably be against.

- I also have very good painkillers, I think you might want to have some.

After a few seconds of hesitating, I jumped into her car saying to myself “my wife definitely will not like this” and we took of. When we’ve got to her place, and she finished the bandaging, I immediately stood up and headed to the exit

- I’m very thankful, but I should leave now, otherwise my wife will kill me

- Don’t be sow silly she said, you should stay for a little longer

When I turned around to say my finale goodbye, she was already half naked, exposing probably the best tits in the world !!!

- I would have liked to, but my wife will definitely kill me !

- What is wrong with you ? I mean, where is your wife right now so you are so scared of her ?!?

While having lunch at the beach cafe, a gust of wind blew the Pope's hat off, right into the water. It floated off about 50 feet into the ocean, then the wind died down.

The press couldn't believe their good fortune as they captured it all on video. The water was quite deep so the Mar-a-Lago staff and the Secret Service were scrambling to launch a boat to retrieve it, when Trump waved them off saying, ""Never mind boys, I'll get it.”

Then Trump calmly stepped off the dock and walked on the water to the hat, picked it up, walked back on the water, stepped back on the dock, and handed the Pope his hat.

Everyone at the event was speechless. No one knew what to say, not even the Pope. But that afternoon, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN &amp; MSNBC reported:

""TRUMP CAN'T SWIM!”",Fake News,1

After going down the rabbit hole of the internet for a while... I'm ashamed to say.... I developed an interest in bestiality.   


But my hunger couldn't be quenched!!! And soon that gave way to darker interests.....and I began to explore necrophilia....

The lady mentions hat her new husband is a funeral director.

Then the reporter asks her if she wouldn't mind telling him a little bit about her first three husbands.

She pauses for a few moments, needing some time to reflect on all of those years. After a short time, she shares some details about her first husbands.

The first, she says, was a banker, whom she married in her 20s. In her 40s, she married a circus ringmaster. In her 60s, she married a preacher, and now, in her 80s, she's marrying a funeral director.

The reporter asks her why, if there was any reason, did she choose to marry those specific people.

She responds, ""Well, I married one for the money, two for the show. Three to get ready, and four to go!""",A news station was interviewing an 80-year old woman who had just gotten married for the 4th time in her life.,16

He glared at the driver and said. ""Big John doesn't pay!"" And sat down at the back.

And the next day and the one after that, and so forth.

This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.

Finally he could stand it no longer.

He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo and all that good stuff.

By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said. ""Big John doesn't pay!""

There  is an audible gasp from the audience, accompanied by a cacophony of  camera shutters. The noise dies down quickly as members of the press  wait for the spokeswoman’s next words.

“We have performed a deep survey of these universes and have acquired a huge amount of data about them.”

“What have you determined?” interrupts one of the correspondents.

“Well,”  says the spokeswoman, “we have some good news and some bad news. The  bad news is that our universe, by any reasonable measure, is the very  worst universe of all the ones we have surveyed”.

The dwarf appears to be drunk as hell as he's swaying and seems to be making an effort not to puke. The man goes to the urinal and does what he came here to do.

As he turns to go to the sink and wash his hands the dwarf splutters:  
\- Hey... hey you!

The man tries to ignore him and finishes washing and drying his hands. The dwarf tries once more to get his attention.  
\- Hey... please dude help me... I need \*buuurp\* I need your help dude!  
The man sighs and says to the dwarf:  
\- What is it?  
\- I... I'm too short. I can't reach up... Can you lift me up?  
\- No way!  
\- Please dude, I'm about to piss my pants!

The man looks around and since there is no one else in the bathroom he figures he can do it quickly and no one will see.  
He lifts the dwarf up so he can stand on the edge of the urinal. The dwarf is leaning with both hands against the wall.  
\- Could you... could you open my fly?  
\- Are you serious? Why would I do that?  
\- Pleeease... I can't do it, I will fall if I let go of the wall!

Again the man is worried that someone will see him but figures he can to it fast.  
He opens the fly on the dwarf's jeans and quickly backs away. As he is about to walk out of the bathroom the dwarf asks him for one last favor.  
\- Ehm dude... could you... you know, take it out for me?  
\- You got to be fucking kidding me, there is no way I'm touching your dick!  
\- Please dude, I really have to pee!

Feeling a bit guilty for putting the dwarf in the situation and seeing that he's already somewhat committed he opens the bathroom door to make sure no one is coming.  
He then marches over to the dwarf and reaches into his pants and pulls his dick out.  
He's disgusted with what he sees, the dwarfs dick is a bloody and pussy mess and the man quickly lets go and backs away making every effort not to puke.

\- What the hell is wrong with your dick?!? You should see a doctor about that!

The dwarf is almost crying.  
\- I already have! \*sniff\*  
\- Well what did he say?  
\- Whatever you do, don't touch it!

He had been running both a YouTube and a Twitter account for an entire decade, and did stand-up in bars and comedy clubs. Everywhere he went, he was showered with praise for his originality and dedication. On one 17th of August, however, he made a tweet saying:

""Has anyone been to Majin?""

Ani was known to tweet daily. After this tweet, however, he stopped. Not only did he stop tweeting, though, but he stopped posting YouTube videos and doing stand-up. Anything he did relating to comedy ceased.

Silently, however, he had started up a YouTube channel under the name of ""mashin659."" On it he posted original cartoons, all of which most would say fell under the comedy genre. It took several years for people to realize this was actually Ani. People suspected it was him due to the name of the channel. Later on Ani had posted a video hinting at him being behind it. His fans who accidentally stumbled upon the channel took this as a confirmation. 

Ani essentially ghosted his Twitter fans. He still browsed Twitter, but stopped doing anything that would show he was active. Naturally, with his following, he had amassed numerous notifications. On October 16th, he decided to check them. 

Nothing of interest showed up until he scrolled down around 49 times. Once he hit the 49 mark, he saw a tweet by Joaquin Phoneix himself. Joaquin tweeted Ani two questions:

""Has your inactivity on social media been all a joke? Wait, what's your last name?""

Ani replied with a picture of cheese, and said:
""The cheese describes my name. It is not a part of it.""",A Sliced Dairy Product,2

After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

But the Catholic church came up with a very creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

I didn't have a ladder so I called to another worker ""hey Hans can you go get the ladder?""
He turned around to his friend (also named Hans) and said, ""yeah Hans can you pass me the ladder so I can help him fix the light?"" So he passed the ladder over to me.

So at this point I realized that I didn't even have a replacement bulb for the light. So I called to a another worker named Hans and asked him, ""hey Hans no.3 can you go get me a replacement bulb?"" So he passed me the bulb.

I was almost done, all I needed at this point was for someone to steady the ladder. Guess what? Another worker named Hans was passing by. So, I asked ""hey Hans can you steady the ladder?""
