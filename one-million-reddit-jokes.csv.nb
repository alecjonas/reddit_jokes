He sees the man, who is obviously drunk, stumble to a car and get in. The policeman decides he will bust this guy for drunk driving as soon as he pulls away.

A few minutes pass. Other patrons exit the bar and drive off, but none look nearly as drunk as the first one. When the car the policeman is watching starts up and begins driving away, the policeman quickly pulls it over.

The policeman tells the drunk, ""Sir, I'm going to have to do a breathalyzer test on you.""

The drunk obliges, and much to the officer's surprise, the breathalyzer reads a zero. He tries again, knowing it must be a fluke, but again the instrument reads zero.

Puzzled, the policeman asks the man, ""What bullshit are you pulling on me here?""

The man replies, ""I didn't have a drop to drink tonight, officer. I'm the Designated Decoy!""

There was already a bit of tension between us and the neighbours, so I didn't want them to know my dog had killed their pet.  I took the rabbit inside and cleaned him up.  Not badly damaged, his fur looked okay, once the dog slobber and dirt was removed.

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody was home next door, so I sneaked into the backyard and carefully propped the rabbit up in its hutch.  It looked pretty good, apart from the fact that it was dead.

&amp;nbsp;

About an hour later I heard the lady next door arrive home, then a scream.  I put my head over the fence and calmly inquired, what was wrong.  She was a bit hysterical and sobbing and just kept saying, ""my rabbit, my rabbit . . . "".

Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start.

The passengers begin glancing nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport.

As it begins to look as though the plane will never take off, that it will plow into the water, screams of panic fill the cabin. But at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air.

Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says, ""You know, Bob, one of these days, they're going to scream too late, and we're all gonna die.""

""I've summoned you three here because I was feeling a bit kind today. I'll give each of you a chance to leave Hell. All you have to do is pass my test,"" Satan says. Of course, he designed his test such that it should be impossible to pass.

""Here are the conditions,"" Satan continues. ""I'll give each of you 24 hours back on Earth. In those 24 hours, you must find one object that would not melt when placed in my hand. If you are successful, you will be placed back on Earth to live your lives anew. If you fail, you will stay here in Hell forever, and will be tortured more than any of the other souls here.""

The three immediately accept the terms of Satan's test; a chance to leave Hell and return to Earth is too good a deal to pass up. Satan then sends them back to Earth to begin their search.

After 24 hours, the rapist, thief, and murderer are summoned back in front of Satan.

""Your time is up. Now show me what you were able to find,"" Satan commands, as he reaches down with an open hand.

The rapist places a rosary in Satan's palm. ""This was blessed by the Pope, and so it should not melt in your hand!""

Satan closes his hand and squeezes. He opens his hand after a few seconds to reveal that the rosary had melted. The rapist is banished to the depths of Hell for all eternity.

Next up is the thief. He places a strange metal cube in Satan's hand. ""This is the rarest and hardest object on Earth. It wouldn't melt even if placed on the surface of the Sun! I am definitely getting out of here!""

Satan closes his hand and squeezes. He squeezes harder. He opens his hand a few seconds later to reveal that even the thief's cube has melted. The thief is banished to the depths of Hell for all eternity.

The murderer then walks up to Satan slowly, getting something from his pocket. He places a little red circular object in Satan's hand. Satan scoffs at how insignificant and useless the murderer's chosen object looks.

""Hah, were you even trying?!"" Satan booms. He closes his hand and squeezes hard. He opens up his hand, and the tiny red object is still there. Perplexed, Satan closes his hand once more, squeezing even harder. He opens his hand to reveal that the tiny red object is still there! He tries this a few more times until he gives up.

""You! What did you bring me? This test was supposed to be impossible to pass! Surely, no object from Earth would not melt in my hand!""

He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him, 

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.""

His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?""

""Okay son, go ahead.""

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.""

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?""

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.""

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

""My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.""

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again. 

""My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

""My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...""

His father replied.

""My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?""

""Alright father. Come closer.""

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.

""The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-""

And then he died.",The story of the Pink Ping Pong Balls,6

A loving friend is like a vagina; she accommodates you fully despite the size of your problem. What kind of a friend are you to me? Penis, condom, bra or vagina friend?
Do you know that the penis is the greatest breakfast ever? According to doctors it has a mushroom head, a sausage body, two eggs and milk that provides nutrients. Thus making ladies healthy and full for 9 months. Besides it also has 3 good manners. 
1. It‚Äôs very courteous, it stands before it performs 

2. It is very emotional, it weeps during performance. 

3. It is polite it bows after performing.



Send to ladies to laugh and to men to make them happy and proud of themselves. 
‚≠ï1. Kama sutra says: If you suck one nipple, the woman herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of ""buy one get one free""!

‚≠ï2. Did you ever notice: everything on a woman's upper body starts with a ""B"". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs &amp; lower body with a ""P"" Petticoat, panties, pussy... That's origin of ""BP""!

‚≠ï3. Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you're fucked.

‚≠ï4. Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.

‚≠ï5. Life is like a dick sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.

‚≠ï6. Practical thought: A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life.


‚≠ïWhen a lady is pregnant; all her friends touch her stomach and say ""Congrats!‚Äù
But none of them come and touch the man's Penis and say ""Well done!""
Moral: Hard work is never appreciated: Only results matter.

Rumors were starting to circulate that he was going to come out of retirement for one last swim-- the 2020 Olympic games.
Nobody knew for sure.  The one thing that anybody knew, though, was that everything would change with the accident.

On a rather unremarkable Thursday, a semi-truck carrying 4 tons of sweet potatoes suffered a failure in its autodrive system.
Instead of swerving right to avoid a gopher in the road (which it was supposed to do), the semi swerved left into oncoming traffic.
The investigation would later reveal that the software in question was written by a drunkard who forgot to spell check his work.
""Left"" was misspelled as ""Loft"", which was a non-sensical word, triggering a fall to the ""Right"" command execution flow below.  And, instead of thinking a hazard was on the left, it thought the hazard was on the right. These were the series of events that led to the accident with the driver in the left lane.  Sadly, that driver was none other than Michael Phelps.

The impact of the accident was bad enough to send sweet potatoes flying up to fifty feet, damaging windshields and scaring a wayward cow.
The damage to Michael Phelps was far worse.  He was hit head-on, and was almost killed (by metal, not by a sweet potato or a frightened cow).
He was lucky to walk away... well, technically ""crawl"" away.  Unfortunately, he lost both of his legs.

It was at that point that things seemed to be all over for Michael Phelps.  His return to Olympic swimming was over... or so he thought.
With the 2020 summer Olympic games fast approaching, a strange new entry was turning heads in all manner of pre-Olympic events.
His name was Simon-- and he was an android built by Google.  He was competing in the Paralympics.

People wondered how Simon was even allowed to compete, but Google was able to show that the android had human components.
The brain contained soft tissue from Tom Selleck and J.J. Abrams.  The body contained actual bone-- donated from a lady who once played a Mermaid in a TV drama.
And, the heart-- well, that was definitely metal.  The cold, dead, heart of a robot... and a winner.

It was about this time that a despondent Michael Phelps was going through physical therapy.  He was told he may never swim again.
He had lost all hope-- until he heard about Simon.  If a Tom-Selleck-mermaid-Abrams bot could compete in the paralympics, why couldn't he?
So, he fashioned the greatest of robotic legs ever seen-- made out of Titanium and love.

Michael Phelps started out slowly, doing small paddling exercises in the pool in his house.  After a few weeks, he could do a lap, although slow.
A few months passed, and he was back up to near his prime.  And, this is when he submitted his bid for the Paralympics-- and qualified.
Of course, Simon qualified too.

Michael Phelps had qualified for three events.  The 100 meter butterfly, the 200 meter butterfly, and the 200 meter freestyle.
Coincidentally, those were the same events that Simon had qualified for.  It was going to be intense.

Their first competition together was the 100 meter butterfly.  Google set Simon into the water, and Michael gritted his teeth.
Things got intense.  The gun went off!  It was neck and neck for the first 50 meters.  Suddenly, Simon pulled past Michael at the halfway point!
But Michael found a last inner pull of human strength, pulling like he never had in his life.  He pulled past Simon, and won!
He beat Simon by two seconds!

The Google engineers did not take too kindly to this, and pulled Simon's body out of the water.  They had a plan.
The next day, Michael Phelps entered the water.  Google brought back Simon, and unveiled something... different.
Simon was wearing nose-plugs.

Confused, Michael asked the engineer why the sudden change.  He replied ""well, we found a leak.  Simon gets water in his nose, and that's how you beat him.""
Dismayed, Michael focused on the task at hand as they lowered Simon into the water.  This was a big event-- the 200 meter butterfly.
The gun went off!  It was neck and neck for the first 50 meters.  Then, Simon took the lead.  At 100 meters, Michael Phelps had a perfect push off the wall.
He made up time, and caught up to Simon.  The same thing happened at the 150 meter mark-- Simon pushed ahead, and then Michael Phelps pushed off beautifully.
It was neck and neck with only ten meters to go when Michael lunged ahead with all of his human strenght.  He won!  This time, he only beat Simon by a half a second.

The Google engineers were furious.  They yanked a dripping Simon out of the water, and left.  Tomorrow would be their day!

And then, it was time.  The great 200 meter freestyle race.  Michael Phelps left the locker room, intensely focused.  When he looked around, sure enough, he saw Simon.
This time, he was wearing a streamlined swimmers cap.  ""What's that?""  asked Michael.

The engineer replied. ""THAT, my friend, is a swimmer's cap.  But, not any swimmer's cap.  This one is made very tight-- so tight that it pushes the components of Simon's brain together so that they can connect faster and give him the win.""

Michael Phelps studied it.  ""That doesn't make any sense.  Swimmers need to be properly fitted for their cap.  If it's too small, it'll cause blood-flow problems.  If it's too big, it'll fall off.  Mine had to be custom fitted.""

The engineer sneered.  ""There you go, throwing away money.  A tighter cap is better.  You'll see.""

They took their places in the water.  This time, Phelps was right next to Simon.  It almost looked like Simon was... goading him?  No-- it couldn't be.
But, the distraction took hold of Michael Phelps just long enough for him to miss the starting gun.  He started two seconds late!

The 200 meter freestyle race started out as an embarrassment.  And, Michael Phelps dug deep inside, pulling to catch up to Simon.  
At 50 meters, he was still behind.  
At 100 meters, he was still behind.  
At 150 meters, he did a perfect push off the wall and was still behind.  
At 190 meters, he was going to lose.  Until...  
  
Until a funny thing happened.  
  
Simon shorted out.  Thankfully, the electronic components didn't kill anyone in the pool!  Simon's body stopped, mid stride, and floated up to the surface.
Meanwhile, Michael passed him, going for gold.  His hand touched the landing and... he won!  The audience cheered.

He caught his breath, and then looked back at Simon, trying to figure out what happened.  And, that's when he noticed it.
Simon's head had caved in.  He floated on his side, immobile, as the engineers rushed to get a pole to pull him out of the water.

Michael Phelps thought for a minute.  ""Ah!"", he said.  ""Capsize"".",[OC] Swimmer Michael Phelps vs. the robot,15

So, a man is travelling through the Midwest and is attempting to get two villages over to meet a friend. 

By the time he has reached the first village he is running very late. He stops at the stables in the first village and asks to borrow a horse that he will return on his way home. The local priest is tending to his horse at the time and says the man may borrow it.

The vicar says that to start the horse you must say, ‚ÄúThank God‚Äù and to bring it to a halt you must say ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù.

The man gets on the horse and says ‚ÄúThank God‚Äù to get the horse going. 

So, the man sets off and heads towards the next town over. All is going well, the horse has picked up speed and is making up time.

However the Horse starts to gain more and more momentum and soon it is barrelling across the landscape at full speed. The horse just gets faster and faster and on the horizon a huge cliff appears, the horse charging towards it.

The man racks his brain for how to stop the horse but just cannot remember. All the while the horse gets closer and closer to the edge. 

Suddenly the man remembers.

‚ÄúAMEN, AMEN, AMEN‚Äù he exclaims

The horse comes skidding to a halt right on the edge of the cliff.

‚ÄúOh, thank god‚Äù he sighs

They are happy to see each other, the difference in wealth has never been an issue between them.

""How are you nephew?"" say Mel ‚ÄúHave you seen my new Jag?""

""My that‚Äôs a fancy car, so let me ask you, what kind of stereo do you have in it?""  Asks Ronnie.

""Why I have a blaupunkt 3500, best you can buy"" 

'Oh"" says Ronnie, ""You know, that‚Äôs actually last year‚Äôs model, this year they came out with the 5500, which is what I have""

'Huh"" says Mel, ""Well, check out my all Corinthian leather seats""

""Well"" says Ronnie, ""Corinthian leather was good a few years ago, but I just had Vulcan leather put in mine, check em out""

'Huh"" says Mel, ""Well, check out my new Bridgestone 6000 tires, cool eh?‚Äù

""Gee"" say Ronnie, ""You should talk to your mechanic, they recalled them, and replaced them with the 8800's, like mine""

And then Ronnie adds, ""So let me ask you Mel, do you have a bed in the back of your car?""

""Wha?"" Says Mel, ""No I don't have a bed in the back of my car.""

""Well"" Says Ronnie, ""Check it out - king sized bed in the back seat of my 2003 Toyota""

And Mel gets out of his car, goes up to Ronnie‚Äôs and leans in and sure enough there is a massive King sized bed in the back of Ronnie‚Äôs car.  He looks at the outside of the car, and its small, look inside and there is a king sized bed.

'Huh?' thinks Mel

Just then the light turns green and Ronnie says ""Ok, see ya"" and drives off.

And this drives Mel just about crazy. He starts telling all his friends and family about the king sized bed in the back of Ronnie‚Äôs car and they all think he has gone mad. 
So Mel starts calling auto shops and asking if they could put a king sized bed into the back of his jag, and they all just laugh at him and hang up on him.  But Mel soldiers on, he starts calling auto shops further and further away until finally he calls ""Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing"" shop in Watsonville California.

""Hello"" Says the guy answering the phone, ""Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing, Dave speaking, what I can do for you?"" 

""Hi"" Says Mel, ""This is going to sound odd, but can you put a bed into the back of my Jag?""

""You bet‚Äù Says Dave ""Bring it in on Tuesday and we'll get that in there for you""

Finally! Mel is delighted and he immediately drives from Toronto Ontario to Watsonville California, (about 40 hours of driving I might add) gets the work done, pays the guy, and drives home as happy as a clam.

Months go by.  And finally, Mel gets his chance.  He is driving along and he sees Ronnie‚Äôs 2003 Toyota parked by the side of the road.  Mel stops his car jumps out and goes over to Ronnie‚Äôs, But, the windows are a little steamed up, there is a gentle rocking motion of the car, and Mel is a little concerned with should he disturb him or not. So Mel waits a couple of minutes until he can't stand it anymore and taps the window.  Nothing happens.  He taps it again only a little louder. A few seconds go by and then Ronnie rolls down the window, a little bit of steam escapes from the car, and there is Ronnie wearing nothing but a bath towel. 

""Hey Ronnie!"" Says Mel ‚ÄúGuess what? I got a bed in the back of my car! Just like you, come on check it out""

'Oh' Says Ronnie, ""You got me out of my shower just to tell me that?""

He turns to the first man and asks, ""What is your first wish?"".
The man thinks for a moment, coughs, scratches his nose, and says, ""I wish I had a billion dollars"". Poof! He's holding a bank note that reveals the money has been deposited into his bank account.
After the genie turns to him, the second, older man smirks, ""I wish I was the richest man in the world"". Again, with a poof, a banknote appears, stating that the man's account has hundreds of billions of dollars in it.
The genie turns to the third man, who strokes his beard, contemplating for a moment, then states, ""I'd like my left arm to rotate clockwise"". All three of the others look at him oddly, and then the genie clicks his fingers once again. Sure enough, the man's left arm begins to swing in a large circle.

""Now, for your second wish,"" the genie prompts, looking at the third man with concern, ""choose wisely"".
The first man wishes, ""I'll never experience disease ever again"". The genie grants his wish, his cough clearing immediately, and his nose losing its itch.
The second man, smiling slyly once more, requests, ""I wish to forever be in my prime"". The genie snaps his fingers and the man visibly ages backwards. His joints and back crack, his skin clears, and his hair fills out, regaining it's lost colour. He stands, a young man of twenty-five. 
The genie turns to the third man, ""Your second wish, be caref-"", ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise,"" the man says flatly. The genie sighs, gestures with a snap, and the man's right arm swings violently, opposite of his left.

""This shall be your third, and final wish. Because of this, take your time, and make your request a wise one"".
The first man says, ""I wish for the most beautiful bride in the world"". With a puff of smoke, a gorgeous woman appears on the man's arm, resting her head on his shoulder"".
The second grins and states, ""I wish to be the most charismatic man in the world"". The genie snaps his fingers, the man turns and winks at the woman, and she begins to watch him carefully, from the first man's side. 
Without hesitation, the third man exclaims, ""I wish my head to nod side to side!"" The genie sighs with disappointment, clicks his finger for the final time, and leaves the men with their wishes. 
After a moment of silence, the men decide to part ways, and to meet in the future to share with each other the tales of their newfound fortune. 

Some years later, the men gather once again to see how they have faired with their wishes. 
The first begins, ""I have never once in these years suffered even the slightest of colds. I have a house on the coast, a beautiful car, and an even more beautiful family. I've made key investments and remain quite rich"".
The second man smiles and says, ""I haven't aged a day since we last met, I have my choice of anyone I ever wish court, and am world renowned as the most generous philanthropist that's ever been, yet I still remain the richest man on Earth.""

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact $1,000,000,000

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over $100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

Each suitor tried their best to charm the princess, but the princess could not choose which handsome suitor to marry.

The princess did love ping pong though, and so she decided to test the suitors' love.

She summoned all three suitors to the grand hall and announced - ""whoever brings me the most ping pong balls shall have my hand in marriage - this is my test of love!"" Each suitor goes off to meet the challenge.

The first suitor comes back a few weeks later with loads and loads of horse drawn carriages filled with ping pong balls. The convoy stretches as far as the eye can see. All together they amount to 1 million ping pong balls and the princess is impressed.

The second suitor realises he has to up his game and hires a fleet of ships to gather deliver the ping pong balls. A few months later ships upon ships line the harbour in front of the princess' castle, and the princess swoons at the sight of 100 million ping pong balls being offered to her.

The third and final suitor then shows up a year later. He's all bloodied and beaten up, horrible scars across his arms. In his left hand he clutches a big brown heavy sack. The princess confronts him, clearly unimpressed and says ""what are you doing!? Clearly this can't beat the 100 million ping pong balls I had from my second suitor! Stop wasting my time!""

Confused, the third suitor says to the princess as she turns to leave ""but my princess, I thought you said KING KONG balls!!""

She writes a note to her boyfriend: 'Babe, why don't we agree on some simple signals? For instance, at night, if you want to have sex with me, reach over and squeeze my left breast one time. If you don't want to have sex, reach over and squeeze my right breast two times.' 

The boyfriend, Dave, thinks this is a great idea. He writes back to Sarah: 'That's great.  For my signs, if you want to have sex with me, reach over and pull on my penis one time. If you don't want to have sex, pull on my penis two hundred and fifty times.'",Signals for sex,39

Three ropes have been wandering in the desert for days and are close to dying of dehydration. They see a little town in the distance and manage to crawl towards it for some relief. 

As they approach, they see some ""NO ROPES ALLOWED"" signs. One of the ropes says to the others: ""I'm not sure this is a rope-friendly kind of town."" 

The second rope says: ""Ya. One of us should check first, before we all just walk in there.""

The third rope agrees, and goes into the saloon, goes up to the bar and orders a glass of water. The bartender says:"" Hey... aren't you a rope?""

The rope says:""Ya.""
The bartender says:""We don't serve ropes here. You better go.""
So the rope turns and leaves to tell the others.

The next rope has an idea. He says:""OK, I'll tie myself up and then I won't look so much like a rope anymore. He goes into the saloon, goes up to the bar and orders a glass of water. The bartender says:"" Hey... aren't you a rope?""

The rope says:""Ya.""
The bartender says:""We don't serve ropes here. You better go.""
So the rope turns and leaves to tell the others.

The last rope has what he thinks is a better idea. He ties him self up, and musses up his ""hair"", and the other two ropes can barely recognize him. So he goes into the saloon, goes up to the bar and orders a glass of water. The bartender says:"" Hey... aren't you a rope?""

And the rope says: ""Nope. I'm afraid not. (a frayed knot)""

The bartender looks him over and says... ""Welcome to town! Here's yer water!""",Three ropes,0

Soon, the first man returned with oranges.

Later, the second man came back with cherries. The chief told him the same thing he told the first man, and pointed at the head on a spike to remind the man of his fate should he fail.

The second man swallowed the cherries slowly, careful not to make any sounds or expressions. However, as he swallowed his 9th cherry, he made a sound and was promptly killed and his head put on a spike.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""
The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.
Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.
Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.
So the horse walks into a bar.

So there are 3 brothers walking down the street. When they see a stick and one brother challenges them to throw the stick as high as they can. 
The first one throws the stick and it goes 2 stories high. 
The second brother throws the stick and it goes 5 stories high. 
Then the 3rd brothers throws the stick(when saying this part start laughing/giggling to let them know that this is the punch line) and it never comes back down. 

-At this point they are looking at you so confused because obviously that makes no sense. 
-so as you're still laughing about it, you tell them, ""don't you get it?""
-they will still be confused. 
-then you say ""well, that was a joke for smarter people I guess, here. I got another one for people that aren't that bright
-they'll bug you about explaining the first joke but just insist that you have to be smart to understand it and maybe they'll like the dumb people joke better

Then you say

So there's this woman boarding a plane with her dog. She takes her seat and is sitting next to a man who decides to light a cigar. 
The plane takes flight. 
The woman says to the man, ""sir could you please put your cigar out?""
The man rudely says hell no. 
The woman then tells the man ""sir if you don't put that out im going to throw it out the window.""
The man then says ""lady if you throw my cigar out the window I'm going to throw your dog out the window""
The women then grabs the cigar and throws it out the window. So the man grabs the dog and throws it out the window. 
A few hours pass by. 
The lady then looks out side the window and the dog is sitting on the wing of the plane. (You then ask them what's in the dogs mouth. They'll reply, ""the cigar"")
And you say. 
NOPE, THE STICK!!!",My favorite 2 part joke ever(Kinda Long),7

A woman and her husband go and talk to their doctor about her fears of child birth.  She says she is far too afraid of the pain and worries that she will not be able to endure it, she asks the doctor if there is anything at all that might lower the pain.  

The doctor replies, ""Well there is one option, but it's used very rarely."" 
""Anything doctor we're willing!"" 
""You see, we are able to divert a percentage of the pain so that the father of the baby feels the pain of the birth, instead of the mother.  You can choose what percentage of the pain you would like to feel.  Be it 10, 15, or 20 percent, although most men cannot endure much more than that"" 
The husband bravely responds, ""Of course Doctor I am certainly willing, lets do it.""

A few days later during labor the woman is in excruciating pain, so they turn the device on to 10 percent.  Immediately the woman feels subtle relief, while the husband feels nothing at all.  

""Wow doctor, this is tremendous, I can't feel anything at all and it's helping her. Can we turn it up?""  So they turn it to 20 percent, and then 30 percent.  Each increase brings the woman tremendous relief and leaves the man baffled and excited.  Convinced that child labor is a complete joke that women have been exaggerating for centuries, he offers to take 100% of the pain.  The labor finishes smoothly with no problems or pain from either party.  They thanked the puzzled doctor for his help and headed home, to find the mailman dead on their porch.",A pregnant woman afraid of giving birth asks her doctor for a solution,366

So the angel said, ‚ÄúAlright, you figure out what you want to ask. I‚Äôll come back tomorrow.‚Äù And he left the philosophers to deliberate.

Some of the philosophers favored asking conjunctive questions, but others argued persuasively that the angel probably wouldn‚Äôt count this as a single question. One philosopher wanted to ask ‚ÄúWhat is the best question to ask?‚Äù, in the hope that some day another angel might make a similar offer, at which point they could then ask the best question. But this suggestion was rejected by those who feared that no such opportunity would arise and did not want to waste their only question.

Finally, the philosophers agreed on the following question: ‚ÄúWhat is the ordered pair whose first member is the best question to ask, and whose second member is the answer to that question?‚Äù Satisfied with their decision, the philosophers awaited the angel‚Äôs return the next day, whereupon they posed their question.

Barbara was known throughout the area for her excellent rhubarb pie.

Since everyone found Barbara's rhubarb pie so delicious, she came to be known as ""Rhabarberbarbara"" or Rhubarb Barbara.

Rhabarberbarbara soon realized that she could earn money with her rhubarb pies, so she opened a bar: The ""Rhabarberbarbarabar"" or Rhubarb Barbara's Bar.
Naturally, the Rhabarberbarbarabar soon began to accumulate regular customers.
The best known among them, three barbarians, so often came to the Rhabarberbarbarabar to eat the magnificent Rhabarberbarbara's rhubarb pie, that they earned the nickname ""Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren"" or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians.

The Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren had beautiful thick beards; ""Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenb√§rte"", or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians' Beards.
When the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren needed their Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenb√§rte trimmed they went to the barber.


The only barber who could trim a Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbart, which they obviously needed, called himself ""Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbier"", or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians' Beard-Barber.


The Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbier learnt from the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren, while trimming their beards, about Rhabarberbarbarabar and Rhabarberbarbara, and her wonderful rhubarb pie. The thought of it made him thirsty for beer, which he lovingly referred to as ""Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier"", or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians' Beard-Barber's Beer.


The Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier could only be bought at one bar in the area, the ""Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbar"", or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians' Beard-Barber's Beer-Bar.


The barmaid who served the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbieres at the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbar, was named B√§rbel, so everyone referred to her as ""RhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbarB√§rbel"", or The 'Rhubarb Barbara's Bar' Barbarians' Beard-Barber's Beer-Bar B√§rbel.

After the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbier had cut the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenb√§rte, the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren took him to the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbar for a beer, and then they took RhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbarB√§rbel with them to Rhabarberbarbarabar, so that the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbier could finally meet Rhabarberbarbara and taste her wonderful rhubarb pie.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood. Startled, he drops a bar of soap. ""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"". To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap. 

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice and three times but nothing happens. So she gives several more tugs, then yells ""Holy Mary, Mother of God, HAND LOTION TOO!""",Soap,1070

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""

When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""

Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.

Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",A Lesson in Morals,476

Fairy: I can bring back the horse but on one condition, at least one of you have to satisfy me with a really good fucking.

The 2nd brother(2nd by age) went first. He inserted his weiner and started fucking her. She was far from being satisfied instead she was bored.

Then came the oldest brother, a known womaniser. He was better than his younger brother, but still too far from satisfying her.

Finally, it was the turn of the youngest brother. He pulled out his dick and started fucking her. To everyone's surprise the fairy started moaning with joy within some seconds into action as that was the best sex she ever had. After a hour he was still going on but the fairy started moaning roughly and was so exhausted that she had to be separated by the other brothers to save her from any damage. 

The fairy was more than satisfied.

Then impressed by his brother, the eldest one said ,"" Damn, man. What... How did you even......."". The youngest brother interrupted and replied ,""What did you think killed the horse?""
