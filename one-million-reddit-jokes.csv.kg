The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squire of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

On entering the store, Violet immediately honed in on the perfect bike - it had streamers, a pinwheel, a bell, and a kickstand. It even was colored violet - her namesake *and* favorite color. 

Not only was it the perfect bike - it was even priced better than all of the other bikes! Joe, Joy, Violet, and Billy proceeded to the front to checkout. The sales clerk looked them up and down, and said, ""Sir - I have to warn you; this bike has been returned multiple times.""

""What is wrong with it?""

""It is haunted.""

Skeptical, Joe asked Violet if she still wanted the bike. Undeterred, she excitedly nodded. Given such a great price and that Violet clearly adored the bike, Joe shrugged and made the purchase, along with a new helmet and some stickers to decorate it with. The family piled into their station wagon, new bike tied to the top, and proceeded home. 

As soon as they got back, Violet strapped her helmet on and Joe helped her onto the bike, helping her balance. Amazingly, she rocketed off as though she had been riding her whole life. Giggling ecstatically, she quickly made it to the end of the street and disappeared around the corner. Joe's heart sank into his stomach, however, as her distant giggles turned into a blood curdling scream. He sprinted harder and faster than he had since his high school track days, rounding the corner to a scene of pure mayhem. A pedestrian had been mowed over, and now laid unconscious with a tire skid on his face. Violet had climbed up onto the lower branches of a small tree as the bike circled around waiting for her to come down. 

""Are you ok, Honey!?"" The bike turned to him, as though it had heard, and began chase. Fearing the fate of the pedestrian and wanting to draw the thing from his daughter, Joe ran as fast as his legs could carry him, yelling at her to get back to the house. Ducking and weaving through the neighborhood, Joe managed to lose the thing and make it home. Through the blinds he saw it prowling around as the sun began to fade for the day. 

Joe knew that he had to do something before the bike attacked again. He went and armored himself up with some old baseball gear and grabbed his hacksaw. On his way out, Joy asked him, ""Wait - shouldn't we return it instead of destroying it?""

""No,"" Joe said stoically, ""We must end this cycle of Violet's.""

This enraged the blonde. Without thinking (as blondes often don't), she threw the hot tea in the beekeeper's face, nearly blinding him! Once she saw all of the honey on the beekeeper's table, she quickly realized her mistake and called the paramedics. 
""Hello. 911. What's your emergency?"" The operator said. 
""Help!"" cried the woman. ""Butte tea is in the eyes of the bee holder!""",Montana,3

After about a day or so, all the ents of the forest arrived. All of them prepared with their wits and bad puns.

One of the ents, an older more vulgar ent, started with his joke: “What do you get when two gay trees come together to build a house?” None of the other ents knew the answer. “I don’t know really know but I’ve heard they put their logs together” he snickered.

There was some laughter among the slow crowd but most didn’t get it.

A somewhat younger ent came along with a pun. “What do most Ents try not to be?” Silence among the crowd. “A basic Birch, of course.”

The crowd laughed a little more than the last.

This continued on, joke after joke for a few days, maybe weeks. The crowd was growing restless as the  jokes people had were bad puns and stuff that rhymed with “tree”. Fights started to break out in rage as ents started getting angry at each other for not telling reasonable jokes.

Then out of the crowd a smaller ent emerged, a little shy at first as they were trying not to get trampled. The ent looked up at all the other older, fighting ents and said “I have a joke I want to tell.” No one really heard at first but the crowd of ents slowly calmed down and the bustle died down so they could listen. When the little ent told the joke, they all laughed with joy as it was the first real joke they had heard in days! They praised the little ent and raised him up! I myself was there, though I cannot recall the joke, all I can say is...",The ents of a forest decided to tell jokes together,0

'Well, I don't know what to do. See, you're on my list, but I have no free rooms for you. But you, you definitely have to stay in hell, so I'll have to find a solution. There are a few people here who aren't as bad as you are... I guess I'll let one go and you'll take their place. However, you can choose whose place you want to take.

'Oh, that sounds okay I guess' says Obama.

Satan leads him to the first room and opens the door. In this room, there's a huge swimming pool. In it, Reagan is drowning. He goes down, then up, then down, then up, and he's gasping for air all the while.

'Oh, no,' says Obama. 'That's not for me, I'm a poor swimmer.'

Satan opens the second door. The room is full of rocks and they see Nixon trying to break up the rocks with a wooden hammer.

'Nah, I have problems with my shoulders and my back, that'd be such a painful thing to do day after day.'

So Satan opens the third door. In the room, they see Clinton lying on the floor, all tied up. Monica Lewinsky is lying on top of Clinton, giving him a blowjob. Obama stares at the scene with a wide smile and says:

'Ah, that I could endure!'

'Alright,' laughs Satan. 'Monica, you're free to go!'",Barack Obama dies and goes to hell.........,20

 As soon as I sat down, Reverend Sharpton came over to me. I don't know why, maybe it was because I was the only white person in the church?

 He laid his hands on my shoulder and said: ""By the will of Jesus the Lord Almighty, and the will of God, you will walk today.""

 I told him I was not paralyzed.

 Then Jesse Jackson came by and said: ""By the Grace of God, and his Son Jesus, the Lord Almighty, you will walk today.""

One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.

Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$250.""

Boy - ""I have a baseball glove.""
Man - Remembering last time, asks, ""How much?""
Boy - ""$750.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball.""

The boy says, ""I can't. I sold them.""

The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""

The son says ""$1,000.""

The father says, ""It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.""

Satan is really pissed and lodges a complaint and asks why was Jesus able to continue from where he left off?

This angered the genie who screamed that he would never ever turn food into a toy.  The genie got so angry that he had his guards rough up the boy and throwing him outside to his waiting parents.  Seeing the bruises on their son, the parents wondered why the genie would treat their son like this.  After a few minutes the parents were getting nowhere.

post,84jgsh,2qh72,jokes,false,1521083971,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/84jgsh/the_zoo_joke/,self.jokes,,"A man had an uncle who happened to own a zoo. One day, the uncle unfortunately passes away. When the man speaks to his uncle's lawyer, the lawyer offers to give him the zoo. The man willingly agrees. The zoo has an aquarium, a lion cage and a bird cage but it is in horrible condition. The man pays thousands of dollars to make the zoo look brand new. He must sell his house in order to afford the costs so he now lives in the zoo. But there is one problem; all the cages are empty.


While looking on the Internet, the man comes across a site that will give him 20 free lions. When the lions arrive, the deliveryman gets the man's attention. He says to the man, ""Take very good care of these lions mister, Foster them, feed them, and give them water.” The man responds “Trust me, I will take good care of my lions."" The deliveryman replies, “Let me be very clear, these are not YOUR lions, these belong to the STATE. Take good care of them and they will remain here at your zoo."" The man hastily agrees, as he doesn’t want any trouble and is just happy that he has some animals in the zoo. The lion cage is now filled up. 


The man has $10,000 to spend to fill the rest of the zoo so he again, searches the Internet. He finds out a nearby pet store is selling Miner birds, for $10 each. He visits the store and sees the clerk. He says he wants to buy a few miner birds. The clerk owns 1000 miner birds, but the deal is the man has to buy all of them. The man pays the clerk all his money to buy the birds. He then fills the birdcage. 


The final thing left is to fill the aquarium. The man goes online to find free fish for the aquarium. He finds a fisherman who sells them by the docks nearby. The man goes to the docks, and finds the fisherman. He pulls the man into one of his boats to show him a pool. Fins pop out of the pool's green water. The man’s mind is blown! He is going to have sharks in his aquarium! The man says “Sharks!” The fisherman replies, “You wish these were sharks, but these be Porpoises.” The man chuckles, porpoises are much tamer than sharks. The fisherman grabs a bucket of fish and pours it in the pool. The porpoises don’t care. He then grabs a seagull, snaps its neck and throws it in. The porpoises go crazy, fighting one another for the seagull and a red glow emerges from the pool. “These porpoises are INSANE, and EVIL,” the man thought to himself. The fisherman says he can give him the porpoises, but he will have to take the curse that comes with them. The man agrees and puts the porpoises in the aquarium.
 

Two days before the zoo opens to the public, the man sleeps there in the snack hut. In the middle of the night he hears the porpoises fighting. “Oh no, they must be hungry!” the man said. He bolted around the birdcage, around the lion cage, and to the aquarium. He poured in a bucket of fish, but remembered that these porpoises only eat birds. He runs around the aquarium, around the lion cage to the bird cage. He grabs as many birds as he can. He then comes up with an idea. The lions are asleep so instead of going around the lion cage, he can go through it, saving some time. He quietly enters the lion cage, and walks to the other side. As he reaches toward the gate a helicopter and a SWAT team surround him. A voice from the helicopter yells through a megaphone, “YOU ARE UNDER ARREST!” The man, very puzzled, asks why, with his arms in the air. The man in the helicopter replies, “FOR CARRYING MINERS ACROSS STATE LIONS FOR IMMORAL PORPOISES!”


Goodbye.

Ow, she thinks. She scratched her gums, and a small bit of blood trickled out. She gargled some water and spat it out; the blood was gone, and she went to take a shower.

In her bedroom, she throws her towel on her bed and puts on her pink shirt. The one that her friend, Mark, said looks pretty on her, she thinks. She can’t help but remember every single time he told her she looked pretty every time she complained to him about her crush.

Her mom calls her downstairs. She runs downstairs and grabs her lunch, then heads out for the school bus.

At school, she sits besides Mark. She asks him if Daniel, her crush, got the letter she told him to give. “It’s fine, Nicole, he got it.”

Recess comes along, and Daniel walks up to Nicole. “Hey, cutie.”

He takes her out to the tree in the playground. Just like she fantasizes. He looks at her, and she looks back. He leans in, and she leans in...

Scream. He screamed loud. Nicole runs to the bathroom in shame.

Crying, she turns on the tap of water. Hot water streaming out, she was going to wet her hands when she notices a drop of blood.

She opens her mouth. Blood. And just like Daniel, she screams.

Two weeks pass by. She is in the intensive care unit, intravenous cord hooked up to her. Daniel never came by to check on her. Mark did.

Nicole was fading fast. She could see a light coming in the distance. All she could think about was how she was so blinded by Daniel to not see that Mark truly loved her. The doctor comes into her room. Nicole asks the doctor to call Mark so she could see him one last time.

Mark was running. The doctor said it was urgent. He had not told her the one thing he wanted to tell her most of all, three words, eight letters. He wanted to see her one last time.

He had run into the room too late. She had already passed. Mark fell to the floor, tears in his eyes. He had lost his chance. He would never be able to tell her. Beside himself in agony, he asked the doctor, “How could this happen? I loved her, I wanted just a few more seconds with her.”

The doctor, face emotionless, tells Mark, “Upon further investigation, we found proteins in the blood we were transfusing into her. We thought she was blood type A, but it was just a Type-O.”

However, they’re all good and kind people.  So, they all go to heaven.

As they stand in front of the pearly gates, waiting to enter, God appears before them.

He says, “My kind and generous people.  Despite me making each one of you extremely unappealing, you all led good and caring lives.  For this behavior, I will grant you each one wish before you enter heaven for all eternity.”

They formed a single file line and the first girl walked up to god and said “I wish I beautiful!” 
*Poof* She miraculously turns into the most beautiful girl anyone had ever seen.

This line of wishing continues as they go.. “I wish I was gorgeous” “I wish I was handsome” “I wish I was good-looking” *Poof* *Poof* *Poof* as God grants each one of them their wish. Making all of them physically appealing.  

Finally it comes down to the last man in line.  Number 20.  As he walks up to God he carries a very sinister grin.  He says “God, before I make my wish, may I ask you one question?” “Of course” God replies.

The man asks “So basically what I just saw is that each one of them wished they were beautiful or handsome as their one and only wish before they all walked into heaven for the rest of eternity?”

God responds “Yes my son, that is correct.”

The man says “Great, I just wanted to be sure...
I wish they were all ugly again.”",Ugly People go to Heaven (semi-long),3

Friday nights were always busy at the restaurant and he was the only one working the kitchen. He decides to grab one of the busboys to help him cook for the night.

“Alright,” the chef says, “tonight is busy, but it’s pretty easy. Everyone comes in to order our beef mince, so that’s the only thing you’ll be preparing tonight. We have two kinds. One is spicy, while the other one has a much more calm flavor and I have the spices prepared already. I’ve been preparing most of it, so you just have to scoop some things together and cook it. To make the calm dish, just take a scoop of the beef, a scoop of the veggies, some of the spice mix, and mix an egg in to keep everything together. Then cook it and server it over the rice I have ready. The spicy one is the same except you only have to use egg whites, the whole egg will ruin the consistency and customers will complain.”

After the chefs long winded explanation the busboy nods and starts to get ready for the dinner rush. After a half an hour they get a complaint on their spicy beef mince, it being too runny. The chef reminds the busboy that only egg whites are used in the spicy dish. Again a little later there’s another complaint and the chef explains again, only use egg whites with the spicy beef mince. After this the chef is getting annoyed and decides to stop and watch the busboy when another spicy order comes in. He sees the busboy mix a whole egg into the bowl.

Fed up, the chef says, “Listen, you keep screwing up the spicy beef mince. Only egg whites go in the spicy dish, and the whole egg goes in the calm dish. Just remember…""

For the goal of the competition, they decided that each of their parties should catch a rabbit, using their espionage skills. The party that manages to catch the rabbit the quickest, wins.

First, the MI5 leaves for the forest. When they emerge eight hours later, they carry a live rabbit in a cage.
""We posted lookouts around the forest, and after spotting the rabbit, we shadowed it until it showed us his hideout, we then just placed the cage over the entrance and waited for the rabbit to fall in our trap. Neat and simple.""

Now, it's the turn of the CIA. They leave into the forest and emerge four hours later, holding a rabbit which seems to have been shot and badly beaten several times.
""We used satellite surveillance to aquire our target, but during the tracking with four inconspicious vans, the subject tried to escape, so we had to use drastic measures. Still counts."" Nobody objects.

Now, it was the turn of the KGB. The four agents disappear into the forest, and return after only an hour. But they are not carrying a rabbit, but hold a bear between two of the agents. The bear is badly bruised, has a limp and keeps his gaze to the ground. Absently, he mumbles ""I am a rabbit. My parents were both rabbits.""","The MI5, the CIA and the KGB are having a competition",20223

I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine shut off and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help. When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbors’ daughter. I'm 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbors’ daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past six months. I told him to stop or I'd leave him. He was fired from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore. 

Can you please help? 

Sincerely, Shelly 


Dear Sheila, 

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine... Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it's clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors. I hope this helps. 

WALTER

The chief then said ""All of your lives may be spared if you can find ten of one fruit and bring them back to me.""

So after a while the first man returned with 10 apples. The cheif then ordered him to stick all ten of them up his butt without making any expression at all on his face. He had a little bit of trouble with the first one and started crying while trying to put the next one in. He was soon killed.

Later, the next guy came in with 10 grapes. The cheif soon ordered him to do the same as the first guy. After to the 9th grape, the man started laughing so hard for no apperant reason, and was killed.

The first two guys soon met in heaven and the first guy ask the second, ""Why did you start laughing? You only needed one more grape and you'd have gotten away!""

The warden declared, ""According to the papers on his bed, he very carefully calculated the weakest point on the wall and repeatedly hit it with a rock until it broke open.""

Finally, they arrived at the last cell that contained the mathematician. Unfortunately, he lay dead on the cell floor from starvation. The officer sighed. ""After the other two, I would have expected he would have also escaped. He also has some papers on his bed."" The warden entered the cell and picked up the papers. Then he shook his head and chuckled.

""It appears,"" the warden said, ""that he spent several days writing a very detailed proof that it was possible to break the wall.

","An engineer, physicist, and mathematician have been imprisoned.",15701

The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so Mr Singh hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce, which costs quarter of a million pounds.

“The car is parked on the street in front of the bank,” says Mr Singh, “and I have all the necessary papers.”

The bank officer agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. After Mr Singh leaves, the loan officer, the bank's president and all their colleagues enjoy a good laugh at the man for using a £250,000 Rolls Royce as collateral against a £5,000 loan.

One of the employees drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, Mr Singh returns, repays the £5000 and the interest, which comes to £15.41.

The loan officer says, ""Sir, I must tell you, we’re all a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and discovered that you’re a multimillionaire. Why would you bother to borrow £5,000?""

At Mass, he asked the congregation, has anyone got a cock? To which all the men stood up.

""No,no,"" he said, somewhat flustered, ""that's not what I meant. ""Has anybody SEEN a cock?"" All the women stood up.

""No, no,"" he said. ""Thats not what I meant either. Has anyone seen a cock that doesn't belong to them."" Half the women stood up.

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy. If the pope won, they would have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people picked an aged, wise rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the pope spoke no Yiddish, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day the pope and rabbi sat opposite each other.

The pope raised three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the pope waved his hands around in the air. The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that the pope stood and declared that he was beaten. The rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay.

Later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened.

The pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my hands around to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and water, to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had beaten me at every move and I could not continue.  He had an answer to everything.  How could I continue with my decree after that?""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won.

""First,"" said the rabbi, ""he said to me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews and I said to him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

""Who knows?"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine.""","A long time ago, the Pope decrees that all Jews in the Vatican must convert or leave...",3854

After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. 

Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. 

The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face.

About a week later, Ginger noticed that the marks left by the whipping were starting to fester a bit so she went to the doctor. The doctor took one look at the wounds and asked, ''Did you get these marks having sex?''

Ginger, a little embarrassed that she slept with Bobby (let alone that she allowed him to whip her with a mini van antenna) eventually admitted that, yes, she did. Nodding his head knowingly, the doctor exclaimed, ''I thought so, because in all my years as a doctor you've got the worst case of van aerial disease that I've ever seen.”

He goes out of the room and asks a maid to bring them all tea in fifteen minutes or so. He then gets back and casually slips in a joke. Fifteen minutes later they are all enthusiastically exchanging offensive jokes about the Party, Stalin and even Lenin himself.

Suddenly the prankster becomes serious and says: 'Actually, I think we should watch what we're saying. Look, even this socket here is probably bugged.' With this, he says into the socket nearest to his bed, 'Can we have three teas in room 340, please?' Everybody laughs.

But lo and behold, almost instantly there's a knock on the door and there's the maid with the three teas. The room instantly becomes very quiet as the men hurriedly drink up their teas and silently go to bed. The prankster, chuckling quietly to himself, falls asleep very happy with his little joke.

He wakes up in the middle of the night to sounds of plainclothesmen taking his buddies away. He jumps out of bed, unsure what to do, and just as the party is about to leave, the last man turns, shakes him warmly by the hand and says,

A butler answers the phone.

Butler: Hello, how may I assist you?

Man: Put the lady of the manor on the phone, please.

Butler: I'm sorry sir, but she asked not to be disturbed. She is, well, she is occupied at the moment with her, uhhh... well, sir, her lover in the home theater room. I'm very sorry sir. 

Man: LOVER?!?! I never thought she would cheat on me! Oh my God!

Butler (uncomfortably): Uh, why yes sir, she has been cheating on you for some time. I am terribly sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but now I am relieved that you know.

Man (very upset): If you want to keep your job, you will do exactly as I say! Do you want to keep your job??

Butler (concerned): Why yes sir, yes I do.

Man: Ok then, listen closely. Go upstairs to the master bedroom and retrieve my revolver. 

The butler obliges and after a long pause, he returns to the phone.

Butler: Ummm, ok sir, I have your revolver.

Man: Now I want you to go to the theater room and shoot both of them. Do this or I will fire you!

Butler: Excuse me but that is outrageous. really sir?? Must I?

Man: Yes, shoot both of them. I'll take care of everything after that. I will pay you $100,000 and this will be our secret. 

The butler, disgusted by the cheating woman and in need of money and to keep his job, agrees and puts the phone down. There is a long pause, followed by two loud bangs. A minute later the butler returns to the phone.

Butler: OK, it is done sir, I shot both of them. Now what shall I do with the bodies?

Man: OK, I need you to throw the bodies in the swimming pool and cover everything with the pool cover. Tie it down tight. I'll be home tomorrow and take care of the rest.

Butler: Pool? What pool? We don't have a pool, sir. 

Man: Wait, is this (405) 984-2943?

The two teams could get in a room, say, near a grass field to keep it clean.

Both teams could make some decisions with symbols of power, say, a small ball. They grab the ball if they have ""the floor.""

The person throws it to the other team, to see what they want to decide.  They can choose to use an object, say a wooden stick, to redirect the ball to another person on the original decision team.

That person could catch the ball, if they decide the other team's decision ""is out.""  It's going to take a while to do this, so they could just make a rule that you get 3 chances to do this, and 3 more chances to send the ball to the other team.

That team could be standing in the grass, if space is needed for this negotiation series.

Altogether, instead of playing baseball, the game is decided by a group of decisions represented by a ball.

In the end, if the decision cannot be reached in several tossings of said symbolic choice (a ball), there shall be nine attempts by each team to make a point that the other team can agree to.

In summary, this I believe could be a shorter way to see who wins, with a ball representing the choices and decisions made by each team.

(Note: if a decision cannot be handled properly, both teams may decide to bring in a mediator, who can wear black to stay in the background).

All in all this could be entertaining, so tickets may be sold to public. I hope you enjoy this alternative to baseball games.",Baseball games take a long time.,2

Nodding respectfully, the Jewish man then told his story. ""One Sabbath I was walking back from the temple when I saw a huge sack of money just lying there at the edge of the road.

There is a Cheerios box, and inside of this Cheerios box there is three levels of the Cheerio Society. The top of the box if filled with the rich and ritzy Cheerios who have the most scrumptious meals and the most fantastic houses. The middle of the box if filled with the average-class Cheerios with an average life, average house, average family. The bottom of the box is filled with the crumby Cheerios, with gang violence and crime in the neighborhoods. 
So, one day, a sad, poor Cheerio decided he wanted to end his life of being at the bottom of the box. His life was rediculous and he wanted to end it. He marched right up to the Average level of the box and went inside of an average resturant. The average waiter said “Hey! You’re a poor Cheerio! You’re not allowed in here!"" And with that, he kicked him out. 
Discouraged, he returned home to the lower levels. That night, he snuck up and found an average, abandoned home, and moved into it. The next day, he lived his average life. His job was average, his house and family were average, everything was average. After about a week or so, he started hearing the joyous sounds of the rich Cheerios eating their rich meals and bathing in their rich pools. He decided he needed to end this average life, and become rich.  He walked up to the Rich levels, and said down in a rich, 5 star resturant. The rich waiter said “Sir, you cannot dine here! Average Cheerios are not allowed!"" And with that, he kicked him out. Discouraged, he returned home to his average house. That night, he snuck into the upper levels and found a rich house of which the owner had recently passed away. After bringing his stuff up, he moved in.  The rich life was fantastic. His job paid well, he had big screen TVs, a pool, and a huge house. The morning after he moved in, he went to breakfast. The rich waiter said “Good morning, sir. What would you like to eat?"" “Well, what do you have?"" replied our Cheerio. “On our menu, we have an omlette, made with vegetables straight from our garden, and the egg of finest hen! Would you enjoy that?"" asked the waiter. “No, thank you. What else is there?"" “Well, we have the freshest fruit straight off of the vine, picked this morning, actually. Would you enjoy that?"" “No, thank you, what else is there?"" “We also have the best blueberry pancakes you have ever eaten. Homemade, hot off the griddle. Would you enjoy that?"" “Yes, please, I’ll have the pancakes,"" replied the hungry Cheerio. “Of course, sir. Just step into the Pancake line and enjoy your breakfast!"" And with that, the waiter took off, and the Cheerio went into line to order his delicious pancakes.  At dinnertime, the Cheerio came back. The waiter, once again, came up and asked him what he would like to eat for dinner. “What is there to eat?"" Asked the Cheerio. “Well, we have the finest steak. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. It’s delicious. Would you like that?"" “No thank you, what else is there?"" “Well, we have the best pizza you have ever eaten, with ingredients imported straight from Italy. Would you like that?"" “Yes!

Would you like that?"" “No, thank you. What else is there?"" “Well, we have a tasty mix of Cola and Pepsi. It’s quite delicious. Would you like that?"" “No, thank you.

""Honk the horn my dear, let's see if that will get rid of him"" replied the Mother Superior. Sister Carlotta did as she was instructed, the horn blared loudly but the vampire did not leave.

""Oh no, Mother Superior, the vampire remains, whatever shall we do now?"" Sister Carlotta asked.

""Try using the wiper blades, that may scare him off."" Mother Superior replied. Sister Carlotta diligently followed the instructions, but the vampire was still on the hood of the car.

""This is just terrible! How will we escape?"" Sister Carlotta's voice was shaky and nervous.

post,843178,2qh72,jokes,false,1520935886,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/843178/long_always_lucky/,self.jokes,,"When I was young, I was always lucky. When I was five, my mom asked me to give 6 numbers for the lottery. “8, 13, 27, 29, 30, 31” I said. Without any hesitation, my mom punched those numbers on the lottery ticket and hoped for the best. Later that night, my whole family was watching the lottery on the television.

“The winning numbers are 8!” The announcer said.

“Five more numbers and I’m a millionaire!” my mom said with a big smile on her face.

“13!” The announcer continued. My dad, who believed throughout his whole life that the lottery is rigged by politicians, suddenly looked towards the television. It was as if he knew that we were going to win.

“27!” We already have half of the winning numbers. My family wasn’t really that rich, so winning the lottery would be a big help.

“29!” Is it really going to happen? Are we really going to win ₱80,000,000?”

“30!” One more number! The least amount we could get now is ₱50,000. Getting 5 out of the 6 winning numbers is already a big achievement in itself. Even if we don’t win, getting 5 winning numbers was already a testament on how lucky I was.
It was as if God heard me and answered with a big “Okay”.

“32!” Silence filled the room. My dad slowly looked away from the television and started reading his book once again. The smile in my mom’s face quickly disappeared as she stood up and went to sleep. Meanwhile, I was still very proud of my achievement. 5 out of 6 was unbelievably good. The next day, I bragged to my classmates that I had an 83.33333% guess rate. Most of my classmates were like “Whoa, that’s amazing” but one classmate of mine asked “Then what happened to the other 16.66666%?”

That guy’s name was Calvin. Up until high school, he was considered as the “Shotgun King”. He would just shotgun any major test but still end up with a 100% grade. He was one of the few people in the world that were luckier than me. At age 11, he already won the 6/55 Grand Lotto four times, and he wasn’t only lucky with the lottery, he was lucky with everything. Five months ago, he won a 2017 Audi A3 Sedan. Three months ago, he won a Mercedes-Benz AMG 43, and about a week ago, he won a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. He won all these via raffle. There were a lot of doubts about his wins since not even the Philippine Air Force has an F-22.

I haven’t been participating in any more raffles since my mom said that I should focus on my studies. While walking to class, I saw this flyer that said about a raffle with the 1st prize of a Samsung Refrigerator. It was the perfect time to test out my luck skills, besides, my family would extremely benefit from a new refrigerator. While I was putting my raffle entries inside the drop box, someone patted my shoulder.

“Hey Kyle!” the guy said. It was Calvin.

“Hey Calvin, what’s up?” I said.

“You’re entering the raffle too?” He asked.

“Yeah man, it’s been a long time since I won something.” I answered.

“Well good luck.” He said. “I’m joining the raffle too, so the chances of you winning are slim.”
After two days, it was already raffle day. Despite what Calvin said, I was positive that I would win, so I sat in front, near where the results were going to be announced.

One by one, the results were slowly announced, starting from the 5th prize.

“The 5th prize goes to Earl Cayanan!”

“The 4th prize goes to Mary Ann Severino!”

“The 3rd prize goes to John Paul Melecio!”

“The 2nd prize goes to Harold Eugenio!”

Finally, it was the time for the 1st prize. In the corner of my eye, I suddenly saw Calvin talking to some security guards. I smell something fishy going on.
“And for the 1st prize, congratulations to Calvin Tolentino!”

Calvin quickly ran up the stage. I didn’t believe the results so I ran up to Calvin, but on the way, two security guards stopped me. I didn’t give up. I shouted: “I’m the real winner, not you! The whole raffle was rigged!” One security guard then grabbed his gun and smacked its base to my head. I passed out.

I then woke up in a hospital room with an old lady whom I’ve never met before, sitting beside me.

“So, do you want to beat Calvin?” She asked.

“What do you mean?” I asked in return.

“I can make you win the next major raffle.”

“How?” I quickly asked as I was interested.

“Well, the next raffle has a bottle made out of diamonds as its first prize. If sold, it could be as expensive as ₱850,000,000.”

“Okay so how do I win it?”

“Hold your horses, young boy, that’s not the real first prize. You shouldn’t win the bottle, but instead, go to the host right after the program has ended. He will give you the keys to the ‘Win All Raffles Robot’ or WARR for short.”

“The what?”

“Okay, this might sound crazy but there is a robot that can make you win all raffle you enter. It’s called the ‘Win All Raffles Robot’.”

“So how does it work?” I asked out of curiosity.

“No one knows, it was sent by God during the 1300’s. What I do know is that whoever has the WARR would never lose a raffle. Your friend Calvin was just really lucky, but with the WARR, you’d be more than lucky.”

“But how would I be sure that the host would give it to me?”

“Well, he is my son.”

“How is he your son?”

“I gave birth to him.”

Since this conversation seemed like it wouldn’t lead to anything useful anymore, I packed my things and left the hospital. Moments later, I saw a flyer that caught my eye.

“Win a 700-year-old Venetian Diamond Wine Bottle worth ₱850,000,000. All you have to do is enter the raffle to have a chance.”

Maybe this was the raffle the old lady was talking about. I quickly went to the raffle booth and entered.

“The raffle draw will be in an hour, sir.” The clerk said. “You can meanwhile sit in our Waiting Area.”

Inside the Waiting Area were chairs, tables, and a television showing a replay of the 2021 NBA Finals. It’s crazy how the Lakers won it in 6 games. Joel Embiid was such a beast for Philadelphia but they still weren’t able to pull it off.

After an hour, I left the waiting room and sat in the front row near the stage where the raffle will be drawn. Slowly, people started coming and the seats started to fill up.

It was time.

The host came out of the curtains and picked one raffle ticket in the spinning jar.

“The 5th prize which is a 1942 Zero Japanese fighter plane, goes to Erika Sanchez!”

“The 4th prize, which is an authentic piece of the Shroud of Turin, goes to Francois LeBourgeoisie!” I can’t believe the host mispronounced his name.

“The 3rd prize, which is the original copy of the Indian epic, the Ramayana, goes to Juan Tiu-Tres.”

“The 2nd prize, which is a legitimate metal shard from the 1947 Roswell UFO Crash goes to Zack Dimagiba.

“And finally, the event you’ve all been waiting for, the 1st prize which is a 700-year-old Venetian Diamond Wine Bottle goes to…Calvin Tolentino!”

“What?!” I shouted as I jumped off my seat.

Someone then suddenly patted my back. It was Calvin.

“It’s okay Kyle, you’ll get your chance.” Calvin said.

I was about to punch him in the face but I suddenly remembered that I never really intended to win the 1st prize, so before Calvin went to the stage to claim his prize, I told him: “Hey Calvin!”

“Yes Kyle?” He said with an intimidating smile to his face.

I moved closer to him, stared him in the eye, and softly said: “You may have won the bottle, but you haven’t won the WARR.”",[long] Always lucky,0
