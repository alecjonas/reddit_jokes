""What's with the money in the jar?""
""Well.., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Maserati."" 
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar. 
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: 

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it

""Second -
There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth.  You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third -
There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot!
I won't do it!  You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila
and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says,
""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.
Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn’t make a face -- and he drinks 
it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.
Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight --
then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar.
His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.
He drunkenly says,

""Now...., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?""",Tequila Bets,10

He’s cleaned about 3 dishes when other seamen start walking up and giving him big smiles and compliments. Then a commander walks up and hands him a gold medal. The man is puzzled. An admiral walks past, so the man stops him. 

“Admiral, people have been giving me lots of attention and compliments. Someone even gave me a gold medal. I’m just doing exactly what the other guy did, so what’s going on?”

Meanwhile, he took a tiny man and a tiny grand piano out of his backpack. He set the man and the piano on the bar top, and the tiny man began to play.

“That’s incredible!” The bartender said, holding the man’s drink. “Where did you get that?”

The man at the bar pulled out a magic lamp from his backpack. 

“This lamp contains a genie that will grant you one wish”, the man said. “Just rub it, and he’ll grant you whatever you want.”

The bartender snatched the lamp away from the man and promptly rubbed it. The lamp quivered and shook for a moment, and with an explosion of light, a genie appeared floating in mid-air. 

“Greetings!”, the genie said. “I shall grant you one wish!” 

“I wish for a million bucks!”, the bartender shouted.

“Coming right up!” 

With another flash of light, the genie was gone. 

Suddenly, a duck walked through the door of the bar, followed by another, and another, and another. Soon, the bar was full of a million ducks.

“This isn’t right!” the bartender exclaimed. “I asked for a million bucks!”

“Oh yeah,” said the man. “I forgot to mention that the genie has a hearing problem”. 

“How do you know that?” the bartender asked.

The genie just has this request: That the man make the most of his life and live like no man has lived before; love like no man has loved before; and care like no man has cared before. The man obliges.

He first sets out to find his ""calling"". Over the years, he works many jobs. He finds himself becoming depressed with the monotony that he has come to know. Finally, he decides to go back to his roots and do what he knows. He becomes a farmer. With the money he has accumulated from his many professions, he buys a large farm where he decides to take in unwanted and ill animals. Goats (obviously), pigs, cows, cats, dogs, and various other animals. He cares for them. He comes to know and understand them. He has a deep connection with them.

One day, a woman brings her dog to the man's farm. She is worried about the dog. She says ever since the dog's sibling died, he hasn't seemed right. The man agrees to take the dog and care for it. He knows the other animals will comfort it and the dog will enjoy his new family. The woman comes to visit the dog regularly. She becomes familiar with all of the other animals on the farm, and most of all, the man. They spend hours together each visit. Talking and taking care of the animals together. Hours turn to days. Days to weeks. The man asks the woman to live with him and his animals. The woman obliges. They are in love. They are truly happy.

The genie comes to the man one night in his dreams. The genie says to the man ""You have lived like no other man; you have loved like no other man; and you have cared like no other man. You have done well"".

The man wakes up the next morning and he doesn't feel well. He can't explain it, but somethings not right. Weeks go by and the man's condition seems to worsen. His doctors cannot explain his rapidly deteriorating health. The woman is always by his side when she's not caring for his animals. The woman's dog sleeps at the foot of his bed. Never leaving. At last, it seems like he cannot hold on for much longer. He's barely able to speak at this point. He motions for the woman to come near. He says to her ""Do you want to know why I fell in love with you all those years ago? Do you want to know why I love you more and more every day?""

She says, ""Yes, my love, tell me.""

With his final breath, he tells her ""Because you make me feel like a kid again.""",A goat gets its wish granted by a genie,10

In fact, here she comes now.”

From across the room swishes an astonishingly beautiful woman, she sits down beside the man, puts her hand on this thigh and stares adoringly at him. The first man is completely agog by this stage, scarcely able to believe his eyes.

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, 

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'",The Southern Grandma,51

""Hmm... let me see. A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know.""

""Excellent!"" said the interviewer. ""The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliche for speed”.

post,ejio14,2qh72,jokes,false,1578072835,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ejio14/the_cathedral_of_science_long/,self.jokes,,"The Pope was fed up with the Catholic Church’s reputation for being anti-science and he decided that in 2020 it was finally time to change the narrative. He called his councilors together so that they could discuss what to do about it. They decided that they would build a new cathedral named after a great scientist to demonstrate the Church’s reverence for natural philosophy. The next question was which scientist to pick. A committee was formed and they set about studying the question. Einstein was an favorite of the public but his estate refused permission noting that while he probably would have supported the Church’s turn towards science, as a Jew it would be inappropriate to name a cathedral for him. The committee went through a long list of other famous scientists but there were problems with all of them. Finally, they landed on Isaac Newton. Newton wasn’t Catholic but he was at least a devout Christian and no one could doubt that he was an important scientific figure. The committee then consulted with the current Lucasian Professor at Cambridge about how best to honor him. The Professor thought it was a grand idea and agreed to participate. But he said his only condition was that the cathedral would have to be in New York. The chair of the commission asked him if he was sure. Wouldn’t it be better located in Cambridge where Newton lived and worked or in Lincolnshire where he was born? The Professor said no, it had to be in New York at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street or he would withdraw his support. The committee chair was very worried. They had been hoping to open the cathedral in 2027 to mark the 300th anniversary of Newton’s death. Manhattan was one of the most difficult and expensive places in the world to build, did the Professor know what he was asking? The Professor stood firm. The committee chair decided he needed help so he spoke to the Pope. The Pope agreed to fly out to Cambridge to speak to the Professor. When he got there he sat down with the Professor and asked him if he understood how unusual it was for the Pope himself to travel to meet with a professor. The Professor said he understood but insisted that to properly honor Newton’s legacy, things must be done in a certain way. The Pope asked him if he knew how difficult this would be and the Professor assured him he did. And one more thing: it wouldn’t be enough to just build at the intersection, the cathedral would have to be built suspended *over* the intersection. The Pope told him that’s insane, we’ll never be able to. The Professor said: you represent the Catholic Church with a billion faithful followers; you are God’s representative on Earth; surely you can work it out. Finally, the Pope agreed. He then immediately flew to New York City to meet with the Mayor and explain the project. The Mayor was extremely skeptical but fortunately for the Pope he was also a good Catholic and agreed to help as long as the Church also agreed to build several thousand units of affordable housing. The Pope agreed to the Mayor’s terms (actually kind of a win-win) and they got started on purchasing land, pushing through zoning changes, hiring architects etc. The Pope and his whole committee working on this project moved heaven and earth but finally the new cathedral was ready on time for the 300th anniversary of Newton’s death. The architectural critics said it was amazing, like nothing that had ever been built before: a graceful cathedral that seemed to float above the crossroads of the world, defying the gravity that Newton described. Politicians, pundits, and theologians said it marked a whole new chapter in the history of the Church. The Pope has actually had to sell off many of their most valuable treasures to make this happen. All this effort and expense clearly cemented the Church’s commitment to science and rationality. At the opening ceremony the Pope took the Professor aside. He said, I hope you understand what I had to do to make your vision happen. The Professor assured him that he did and that it was all worth it. The Pope said that there were whole countries that had actually schismed from the Church over this and could the Professor please explain why it had to be so difficult. The Professor said he would explain everything in his dedication speech. They all took their seats for the lengthy and beautiful ceremony. Finally, after the full Catholic rites had been performed, the Professor came to the pulpit to speak. He started softly but soon his voice rang out: “You all can now feel the force of Newton across the centuries as we have at last held Mass meters over Times Square!”",The Cathedral of Science (long),0

""Weary well"" the Englishman says and throws out a fork ""Why'd you throw that out?"" the Russian asks and the Englishman responds ""Oh, that, we have plenty of those where I come from"" a few minutes pass but the captain informs them the plane is still too heavy,

next comes the Latvians turn so he throws the Russian out the hatch ""WHY'D YOU THROW THAT OUT!?"" the Englishman exclaims and the Latvian just looks at him for a moment and responds ""Oh, that, we have plenty of those where I come from""

A kid playing behind a church suddenly runs in and excitedly tells a nun ""Look! Look! A fork just fell from the sky!"" ""That is gods fork my child, he must have dropped it while he was eating ,now go back out and play"",

The principal makes an announcement telling everyone to remain calm and that the security cameras would be reviewed to help in finding her. All the other students he tells to head home for their safety while he and the other staff stay behind to investigate. As the staff begin to rewind the footage things get even stranger, for all the footage from prior to the girl's disappearance has been deleted! Then before they can pass this on to him, the principal also vanishes without trace! Now panicking, the staff exit the college in fear of being next and phone the police. The brave cops, armed and in large numbers, slowly make their way through the dead silent building highly alert. 

Two of them investigate the principal's office. The first officer looks over the desk for clues while the second looks at the printer and chairs. ""I can't find anything...what about you?"" says the first officer. His companion does not reply. Turning around, the cop is terrified to see the other cop has joined the other two victims by disappearing into thin air! He calls for him and no reply. Despite being brave normally, the cop is now so scared that whoever or whatever is causing these vanishings will strike him next! Almost paralyzed with fear, he spins his gun to face the source of a strange mechanical sound. WHIRRRRR Ka-thunk-Ka-thunk-Ka-thunk WHIRRRRR! The printer is on and sounds exactly like it's inking a word document line by line...but none of the lights are on! And if that wasn't bizarre and creepy enough, the machine made a large WHIRRR sound as if paper was coming out, but not a single sheet did! After that it was all silent. The cop raced out of the office screaming ""It's a ghost! It's a ghost in the machine!"" 

With the office empty, a young woman's voice then comes out from inside the printer. ""Day-am! A principal and officer and me really make one hot threesome and those printer sounds you make really helps us hide!""","At a college, a student mysteriously disappears without a trace...",0

""But how will I let you know the baby is born?"" she asked.

He replied, ""Just send me a postcard and write ""spaghetti"" on the back. I'll take care of expenses."" Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy.

Six months went by, and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and said, ""Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means.""

The doctor said, ""Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you.""

Later that evening the doctor came home, read the postcard, and fell to the floor with a heart attack. Paramedics rushed him to the hospital emergency room. The head medic stayed back to comfort the wife. He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest.

So the wife picked up the card and read: ""Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - Two with sausage and meatballs; two without.""",Doctor's Affair,2037

On their 46th trip to the state Fair James asked to go on the helicopter flight, and Lucille told him that 50 dollars was still 50 dollars.

The helicopter pilot heard their conversation and felt a bit sorry for James. He approached them and told them that he would give them both a ride for free if neither one said a word for the whole flight. If either one said a single word he would charge them the 50 dollars. James and Lucille agree.

The pilot takes off and climbs as fast as he can and immediately goes into a dive, but he doesn't hear a word from the couple. He flies in circles, climbs and dives, zigs, zags, and everything in between. The couple never say a word. Finally he lands the helicopter.

First-year veterinary students were attending their first anatomy  class with a real dead cow. They all gathered around the surgery table  with the body covered with a white sheet.

The professor started the class by telling them, ""In Veterinary  
 medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a  
 doctor. The first is that you not be disgusted by anything  
  involving an animal's body."" For an example, the professor pulled back  the sheet, stuck his finger into the butt of the cow, withdrew it, and  stuck his finger in his mouth. ""Go ahead and do the same thing,"" he told  his students.

The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but  
  eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead cow  and, sucked on it.......followed by assorted gagging, retching and  spitting.

When everyone had finished wiping their faces, the  Professor looked at them and said, ""The second most important quality is  observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger.  Now learn to pay attention. Life is tough but it's even tougher if  you're stupid.""",Pay attention,17

A bird pathologists examined and confirmed that the crows did not die from Avian flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.

During greater analysis, it was noted that from the varying colors of paint on the crows, it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks and only 2% by cars. Several animal behaviorists were hired to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly found the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

The conclusion was that when cars were coming, the lookout crow would say ""CAH, CAH"" none could say ""Truck.”",Dead crows,21

The dad takes it home and decides to try it out for himself, so he douses it in gasoline and throws a match at it. The bear goes up in flames.
next day he goes back to the shop with the ashes, and demands a refund. The shopkeeper apologizes profusely, stating that he must’ve forgotten to put the magic spell on it. so he takes the ashes, arranges them in the shape of a bear, and says a few words, and the bear is re-created just as it was before, but this time with a little bit more of a glow. 
The man seems satisfied, so he takes it home and decides to try out the so-called magic abilities again before giving it to his kid, just to make sure. Again, he tosses it in gasoline, and tosses on a match. Flames woosh and a minute later, sitting in the middle of a charred circle, sits the bear, perfectly untouched.
Kid loves it, best present he ever had.

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me, I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife.",Socrates the philosopher . . .,70
