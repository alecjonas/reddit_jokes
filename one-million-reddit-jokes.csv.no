asked him ""What word did you say son?"" And Jimmy replied ""Do you promise you won't get mad?"" His mom nodded in assurance so Jimmy said ""purple fire"" Jimmy's mom fainted and after a couple hours when she recovered she told Jimmy he was grounded for life and was going to tell his dad. Jimmy sat in his room and tried to think of what purple fire was and how it was so bad until he decided to take a nap. He woke up later on that day by a door slamming and Jimmy could tell it was his father. Jimmy cowered to a corner of his bed as he knew that he was going to get in more trouble for no reason after a couple minutes Jimmy's dad walked into Jimmy's room with tears on his cheek, he then asked Jimmy what happened so Jimmy said the story ""I was playing in the sandbox and someone whispered purple fire in my ear so I asked a teacher and they sent me to the vice principals office and the vice principal sent me to the principal and the principal Expelled me and sent me home and mom grounded me because of it"" Jimmy's father could barely let the words out of his mouth but still asked ""what word did you say again son?"" And Jimmy said ""purple fire"" Jimmy's father began to bawl up and cried out that it was true and told Jimmy to pack his bags as he rushed out of the room after a couple minutes Jimmy had his backpack filled with clothes and his father told Jimmy to leave his household and never come back again and that Jimmy wasn't his son anymore. Jimmy left sad and confused and decided to go to a nearby supermarket because there was food and air conditioning. Once he arrived at the supermarket he was told by a cashier that it was closing time and kicked Jimmy out, so he started walking in a random direction and decided to go wherever it took him. Eventually he met a homeless person who offered to take him to his homeless camp and Jimmy accepted after walking for a while without saying a word to each other the homeless man asked Jimmy what his 'story' was and Jimmy said ""Well at first I was playing in the playground then someone whispered something in my ear so I asked a teacher what it was and they sent me to the vice principals office and so I asked the vice principal what it meant and they sent me to the principals office and the principal expelled me and sent me home so I told my mom and she told my dad and they kicked me out of the house and I tried to go to a supermarket but they closed so then I started walking and then I met you"" The Homeless person looked at Jimmy and asked what words would get him in so much trouble and Jimmy slowly said ""Purple Fire"" knowing that something bad was going to happen. The homeless man took a second to take it all in and pushed Jimmy onto the floor and said that Jimmy was a monster and he didn't want to associate himself with the kind of person that uses those words. This made Jimmy cry because if a homeless person wouldn't take Jimmy in, he was going to be alone forever. So Jimmy payed on the same exact spot he was pushed to and slept. Police sirens woke him up and he saw a police car next to him. There were to officers in the car and one sighed and told the other that the kid was alive, then he walked out and asked Jimmy what he was doing and Jimmy told the officer that he was playing in a sandbox and someone whispered in his ear a phrase and Jimmy asked a teacher what it meant and the teacher sent him to the vice principals office and the vice principal sent him to the principals office and the principal then expelled Jimmy and sent him home and his mom grounded him and had him tell his dad and his das kicked him out of the house and Jimmy tried going to the super market but instead met a hobo who brought him to where he was before abandoning him because the words he had said. The officer chuckled and asked Jimmy what words he said and Jimmy said ""Purple fire"" and proceeded to ask the officer what it meant. The officer cried about how horrible the youth was and how the next generation is screw and shot himself. His partner (who was in the car looking at his phone) came out of the car and asked Jimmy what happened Jimmy asked ""First can you tel me what the heck purple fire is?"" this made the cop handcuff Jimmy and throw him in the back of his cop car and as they drove to the precinct the cop asked Jimmy ""where did you hear those horrid words so Jimmy told the cop ""It started when I was playing in the sandbox and someone whispered it in my ear so I asked the teacher what it meant and the teacher sent me to the vice principals office and he sent me to the principals office and the principal expelled me and sent me home and I told my mom and she sent me to my room and my dad disowned me and kicked me out of the house and I started walking and I met a hobo who after hearing me say those words abandoned me and then I went to sleep and afterwards I met your partner and told him and he shot himself and then you know the rest"" The cop stayed silent after that and once they reached the precinct Jimmy was out in a holding cell for a couple days, afterwards he was sent to court (without a lawyer because the crime he commuted was too horrid) and the judge ordered court into session. The judge was known to be fair to all people and a little ""soft"" on the youth so Jimmy thought he might get out of whatever is happening. In the courtroom Jimmy realized there was no hurry or prosecution or defense there was only him and the judge. The Judge simply asked Jimmy what had happened so Jimmy told the full story of how he was playing in the sandbox and someone whispered in his ear purple fire and then he asked the teacher what it meant and the teacher sent him to the vice principals office and after talking to him he sent him to the principals office and the principal expelled him and sent him home and his mom grounded him for life and sent him to his room and when his dad got home he told his dad what happened and his dad disowned him and kicked him out of the house so Jimmy tried going to a supermarket but was kicked out and then he met the homeless guy who offered to help but after hearing the story abandoned Jimmy on the street and Jimmy went to sleep but was woken up by the 2 cops and after telling one of them the story the cop killed himself and the other brought him here. The judge began to laugh and then told Jimmy that the way for him to learn about purple fire is to go to the old cabin near the edge of town and the person in the cabin would tell him whatever he needed to know. The judge gave Jimmy a slip of paper and the paper was directions it said ""2 miles north from the courthouse turn left to the red brick path for 1/2 a mile then cross the street and go north for another mile and he should arrive at the cabin"" Jimmy thanked the judge for the directions and the judge gave him a compass to help him. Jimmy followed the directions by going north for 2 miles then event to the red brick path and stared crossing the street when he was ran over by a car.

Jimmy forgot to look both ways before crossing the street. Don't be a Jimmy, be safe, look both ways.",Purple Fire,0

There's a computer in the drug store that can diagnose anything. It's quicker and cheaper than visiting a doctor. Simply put a urine sample in the machine and it will diagnose your problem and tell you what to do about it. It only costs $10.”

Pete figured he had nothing to lose so he filled a jar with a urine sample. He went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited $10. 

The computer started to make a weird nose and various lights began to flash. After a brief pause, a small slip of paper printed. It said: ‘You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labour, it will be better in two weeks’. 

Later that evening, while thinking how amazing that computer was, Pete began to wonder if it could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 

He went back to the drug store, poured the sample into the machine and deposited $10. 

The machine again made the usual noise and printed out the following analysis: ‘Your water is hard, get a softener. Your dog has worms, get him shots. Your daughter's using cocaine, get her into a rehab clinic. Your wife's pregnant, it's not yours, get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.’

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say ""Happy Birthday"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone, ""Happy Birthday"". I thought....well, that's marriage for you, but maybe the kids will remember. My kids came down for breakfast and didn't say a word.

So, when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good morning,
Boss, Happy Birthday"". It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"". I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go"".

We went to lunch. but we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day....we don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back."" ""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and after a couple of minutes, she came 
out carrying a huge birthday cake......followed by my wife, kids and
dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there........

on the couch.......

 ''Well,'' drawls the farmer, ''you can stay here, but I don't want you messin' with my sons Jed and Luke.''
The woman looks through the screen door and sees two men standing behind the farmer. ''Okay,'' she says. After going to bed, the woman begins to get a little hot thinking about the two boys in the room next to her. So she quietly goes into their room and says,


 ''Boys, how would you like for me to teach you the ways of the world?''


They say, ''Huh?''


She says, ''The only thing is, I don't want to get pregnant, so you have to wear these rubbers.'' She puts them on the boys, and the three of them go at it all night long.


Forty years later Jed and Luke are sitting on the front porch, rocking back and forth. Jed says, ''Luke? You remember that woman that came by here forty years ago and showed us the ways of the world?''

''Yeah,'' says Luke, ''I remember.''

“What can I get for you sir?” The bartender polishes a small glass and looks the bedraggled man up and down.

“Hey,” The man ushers him closer conspiratorially, obviously slightly intoxicated. “I want to make a deal with you.”

“What’s the deal?” The bartender asks, leaning away as the man leans closer.

“The deal is, if you give me a free shot of whiskey, I will show you the most AMAZING thing you have ever seen in your entire life!” The man gestures wildly.

“Yeah?” The bar tender raises a suspicious eyebrow. “And what if it’s not the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life?”

“Oh I’ll pay.” The man pulls out a couple wadded twenties from his pocket and shows the bartender. “Deal?”

The bar tender shrugs, pours him a shot of whiskey, and slides it over.

The man downs the shot of whiskey in one gulp, sucks through his teeth, nods satisfactorily, and bends down to rummage in his backpack. A moment later he reemerges with a very small man wearing a fancy tuxedo; tails, white spats, greased black hair, the works. The man takes a couple distinguished bows as the normal sized man disappears under the bar again and comes back up with a tiny grand piano and a bench. He sets them down and the tiny man flips out his tails, sits on the bench, and begins playing a beautiful concerto.

“Wow!” The bar tender exclaims. “That IS the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life! Where did you get that little guy?”

“Well, if you give me another free shot of whiskey, I’ll tell you.” The man looks from his empty glass to the bartender.

“Sure! Of course!” The bar tender pours him a large shot and sets in down in front of him.
The man downs the shot of whiskey in one gulp, sucks through his teeth, nods satisfactorily, and bends down to rummage in his backpack. A moment later he reemerges with a Persian looking, slightly tarnished oil lamp, and slides it across to the bartender.

The bartender looks at the man questioningly, but the man only examines the inside of the shot glass sadly.

The bartender picks up the lamp, rubs it, and out pops a wrinkly old genie from a cloud of purple smoke.

“Your wish is my command.” The genie wheezes, putting a withered hand next to his ear.

“Oh, um, okay” The bartender scratches his head before shrugging. “How about a million bucks?”

“Mmmnn? Oh, uh, granted.

The genie snaps his fingers, disappears in a cloud of purple smoke, and the bar is suddenly pack full with a countless number of squabbling mallards.

“What? What’s this?” The bar tender gestures around at ducks suddenly filling up the bar. “I didn’t ask for a million ducks! That old genie is deaf!”

“Yeah, tell me about it.” The man runs his finger along the glass before licking it clean. “You think I wished that I had a ten inch pianist?”

All is going well as the Dwarves are asking questions about faith and the church in an albeit innocent and childlike manner. But for some reason Dopey was quiet. He was shying away and looking embarrassed which wasn't all that odd for Dopey but the Pope in his kindness and curiosity wondered why the little guy had no questions. After all few people have the opportunity to speak privately with the mouthpiece of the Lord so surely this young dwarf must have had at least one question.

So the Pope asked the other Dwarves, ""doesn't Dopey have something he'd like to ask?""

""Oh he certainly does!"" exclaimed Doc. 

""Ask him, Dopey. Ask him,"" said Sleepy.

So, sheepishly Dopey asked, ""Are there any convents in Alaska?""

The Pope thought this was a strange question but still he replied, ""Yes, my son. The church has convents in Alaska.""

But the other Dwarves persisted. All of them continuing to say, ""ask him, Dopey. Ask him.""

So Dopey asked, ""Um, Mr. Pope, sir . . . are there nuns in Alaska?""

A stranger question still but the Pope replied, ""Yes, my son. There are indeed nuns in Alaska.""

But the Dwarves kept on with, ""ask him, Dopey. Ask him.""

""Um, ah, honorable Pope, um. . . are there any midget nuns in Alaska?""

At this the Pope felt little Dopey was just being silly and simply not considering the grave honor that had been bestowed upon these Seven Dwarves. 

""No, Dopey. There are no midget nuns in Alaska and I have no idea why you would ask such a silly thing.""

To which the other Dwarves replied, ""*Dopey fucked a penguin, Dopey fucked a penguin!*""",The Seven Dwarves are invited to Rome for a visit with the Pope. . .,12

However, whilst Tony could always get his way with the council, Alicia couldn't convince them of anything, and always had her proposals rejected.

One day, Alicia decided that she'd had enough, and asked Tony how he always managed to get the council on his side.

""Well"" replied Tony, ""the trick is, the day before, buy some chicken drumsticks and put one under the platform where you stand while you're talking to them. Of you do that, they're bound to come round"".

Alicia was sceptical, but she decided it couldn't hurt to try. At the next meeting, she did as Tony had instructed and, much to her surprise, the council was completely on board with her proposals. Alicia was amazed by this, and so from then on, she always put a box of chicken drumsticks under the platform when she went before the council. 

After some months, Alicia had joined the Labour party and, partly thanks to Tony's trick, she was elected in her constituency. She would soon address Parliament for the first time, and she was so nervous that she forgot to get any drumsticks beforehand. When she arrived at the Houses of Parliament on the day, she realised she had no chicken, and in a panic, she bought a sandwich from the cafeteria instead.

When she addressed Parliament however, she spoke very poorly and she could only give very poor arguments for her proposals. After the booing from the Tories had subsided, the prime minister stood up to say:

""We can certainly ignore all that this woman has said, she clearly doesn't have a leg to stand on"".","Two friends, Tony and Alicia, decided to start getting involved in local politics",2

""What's the matter?"" asks the captain.

""Arrr"" says the captain ""Follow me!"" The man follows the captain to what appears to be a barrel, on top of the barrel stands a coconut with a face drawn on and a few strands of wispy straw for hair. On the barrel is a crude outline of a woman's body and between the legs is a bung hole. ""We calls her Carmen,"" says the captain, ""and you may take her as you will"". The man explains that he was unlikely to make use of her and goes on his way.

However, as the hours go by with no respite, Carmen appears more and more attractive to the young man. Finally he can resist her no longer and the man has his wicked way with Carmen the rum barrel. To his amazement the experience is far more satisfying than he could ever have imagined!

The next day the captain greets him again. ""How did you get on with Carmen then, lad?"" he asks eagerly. The man replies ""Rather better than I thought... actually, it was rather good! I can't wait to go again tomorrow!""

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.. 

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. 

She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well 

Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. 

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. 

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her.. 

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said. 

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots."" 

He did as she asked, ever so slowly. ""Now take off my socks."" 
He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. 

""Now take off my skirt."" 

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. 

""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. 

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.""

Well she was pretty intent on getting a drink and remembered a bar she saw on the drive in about a block away so she walks there. She sits down at a table and begins looking at a drink menu. A couple minutes pass and she overhears some guys talking about how they just saw some guy flying around the hotel bar up the street. 

Now she's curious. She leaves this bar and heads back. Sure enough, there's the drunk guy flying around like a bird. She get's ecstatic and runs to the bar tender and says, ""I'll have whatever HE had!"" 

The bartender hands her a beer and she pounds it in 30 seconds. She takes the elevator to the rooftop patio on the 30th floor, steps over the ledge and falls to her death.

Now he wants to profess his love to her in the most special and unique way ever. So he decides to get her name tattooed onto his dick. It is good to note that most of the time his dick reads just 'Wy' or 'Wey', ya know depending how cold the room is.

Fast forwarding....

This fellow is going on a business trip to Jamaica, so he sits down with a friend of his who had gone before. To ask what he should expect there. His friends tells him about how there are these nude bars and that he shouldn't worry about nudity there and to not make a big deal about anything.

Well, by this point the man has gotten to Jamaica and he's had a few meetings so he decides to go get a drink at the local bar. After a while a man, completely naked, sits down on the stool right next to him. Now he's heard a rumor that Jamaican men have very large dicks and he can't help but to see if this rumor is true!

So he casually takes a peek and notices that the man's dick have the letters 'Wy' tattooed on it!! Well now he has to know why, but he feels really awkward asking about the man's penis cause that would mean he looked at it. But he has to know! So he looks at the man and says , ""excuse me, this is a bit awkward of me, but, I just have to know."" *Pointing at the mans exposed penis* ""do you have a wife named Wendy too?""

The Jamaican man looks at him, looks down at his dongle, looks back at him and laughs, ""hahahaha nooo mon, dis says 'Welcome to Jamaica, have a very nice day' """,A joke my friend told me.,8

So the Man gets on his bike and travels 10km east and sure enough there's a dragon. It's fire I swear hot enough to melt mountains but eventually the man manages to defeat it. A Hawaiian monk approaches the man.

""You seem very strong, do you mind helping me?"" The Hawaiian monk asks.

""Sure, what do you need?"" The man replies. The monk tells him of a hidden temple in the desert. So the man hires a private jet and flies into the desert where he meets a sphinx. The sphinx asks him a riddle.

""What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three in the evening?"" 

After 13 hours the man figures out the answer, a human. The sphinx leads him to the temple. As the man goes through the temple he has to kill hundreds of penguins but finally he makes it to the top floor where there is a red jewel.

He picks up the jewel and a spaceship appears. Bored, the man gets into the spaceship and flies through the galaxy, exploring a ton of planets including Namek and Saturn. Finally the man finds a tiny planet with the surface area of a football pitch. He sets foot on it when a tree ambushes him.

""Hello, will you take me to earth?"" The tree asks.

""Sure."" The man says.

""You're a great dude so I'll grant you one wish."" The tree promises.

""Could you make me a watch that measures time 100% accurately wherever I am?"" The man asks.

post,6jizx7,2qh72,jokes,false,1498451657,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6jizx7/stuarts_legacy/,self.jokes,,"There once was a boy named Stuart. Stuart was born to a single mother named August. August loved Stuart more than words could express. She took Stuart with her everywhere she went and they were very happy and inseparable. Unfortunately, one dreary day, August and Stuart were driving to town for groceries, when a van ran a red light and slammed into August’s car. August was killed instantly. Baby Stuart was unharmed but now he was an orphan.
 
Stuart had no other living family and was sent to an orphanage. Stuart stayed in the orphanage for 3 years, and on his 4th birthday he was adopted by the Wongs family. The Wongs were a young Chinese couple, named June and Henry, who weren’t able to have children.
     
Early life was good for Stuart and the Wongs, Until June died of a brain aneurysm when Stuart was 8. From then on, Stuart’s happy life wasn’t so happy anymore. Henry went out and drank all day from depression. Late at night Henry would stumble back home drunk and agitated. That’s when the beatings happened.
    
Stuart grew to hate Henry, but he also felt like it was his fault. He had never had a father before and now the only father figure in his life would get drunk and beat him. Stuart tried his hardest to win Henry’s favor, he wanted to make him happy and proud of him.
    
When Stuart was 16, he devised a plan to get rich and famous so his father would finally notice him. Stuart decided he’d become a famous race car driver. He got a part time job at the local arcade as the race track instructor for the go-karts and practiced going around the circular track as much as he could.
    
Stuart never owned a car, he only got to drive the go-karts at his job until he was 19 and needed a real job. Stuart quit his job and walked down to the race track and got a job in a pit crew for a NASCAR driver.

After a couple months of working on the driver’s car, Stuart was named the pit captain and was great friends with the NASCAR driver. Still his father wasn’t proud of him. He didn’t come to any of the races Stuart invited him to.

One day, Stuart got up the courage to ask the driver if he could take his car for a spin on the race track. The driver obliged and showed Stuart how the car worked and how to shift gears. Stuart had never driven a car so it was a lot to take in. After a while, he got the hang of it and could do a couple laps around the track.

5 years later when Stuart was 24, the driver retired and the sponsors needed someone to take his place. Since Stuart had been practicing and learning from the driver, he became superb on the track and was ultimately chosen as his replacement.

He had done it, he was officially a NASCAR driver, surely now his father would recognize him. However, that wasn’t the case. His father never showed up to any of his races.

Stuart was exceptionally gifted and won every race he participated in by a landslide. He was the best racer on the planet. Finally, it was time to compete for the championship. 

It was a day like any other day for him, he wasn’t nervous at all. He was confident and excited for his chance to finally show his father that he deserved his attention. Then he saw him in the stands. Henry, his father, actually came to his championship race, not only that, but he was supporting Stuart with a pendant that read, “Stu Wongs #1” Stuart couldn’t believe it, he cried until he heard the roar of the microphone.

“Racers start your engines!” The announcer cried. Stuart had so much joy in his heart, he revved his engine as loud as it would go. And then they were off. Stuart took a commanding lead and held it all the way until lap 497/500. Then tragedy struck.

It was lap 498 when his back left tire blew. He was about to smash into the wall, but luckily for him, he just had to make a right turn to avoid it. Unluckily for him, he had no idea how to turn right.

You see, he’s never owned a car, he only turned left his entire life. He turned left on the circular go-kart track, and all NASCAR drivers do is turn left on the ovular shaped track. He didn’t even know he had the ability to make a right turn.

That being said, he rammed the front end of his car into the wall and died a slow, painful death.

It was too bad that Stu Wongs never makes a right.

The professors are pleased and the next day they all enter the plane. However, just before the boarding stage is complete, the captain, who used to be a former student, makes a quick announcement:

Captain: ""This is your captain speaking. Welcome all of you! I'm happy to announce that lift off will come shortly, we are just making a few safety checks and preparations. You all deserve this reward and hope you have a wonderful time""

The professors clap and congratulate each other. However, the captain then says:

Captain: "" As an additional surprise, this plane was built by your very own students and took months of hard work and dedication""

Immediately the professors, all but one, are screaming and frantic to get off the plane. They all rush towards the exit, almost trampling the flight attendants. The captain is shocked and hurt, as are the rest of the students that their professors had no faith in them. Except for the one who stayed.

A few minutes later, the captain and a couple of students walk up to the professor and ask why he didn't leave.

Professor: "" Ha, don't worry my pupils, I had complete and utter faith in you all.""

The students, filled with joy, thank the professor, who then says,

Professor: "" If the plane was really built by you lot, I wouldn't have to worry about the plane crashing; you wouldn't even get the plane to start.""",Engineering at its finest,7

7 being my lucky number, I take this as a sign. I call an uber and decide to go to the horsetrack to gamble. The estimated fee for the uber comes out to $7.77 and when the uber pulls up I see that its license plate is 777 7777. Oh and the street that the horsetrack is on? 

85th. 

But anyways, when I get to the horsetrack I see that I have $700 left in my bank account. I go up to the booth, booth #7, and see that on the 7th race the 7th horse goes by the name of Lucky Number Seven, and is the favorite at 7:1 odds. 

Imagine! 

This had to be a sign. It just had to be! I had a good feeling in my gut so I threw all $700 on this horse, Lucky Number Seven. 

And I'll be goddamned if he didn't come in 7th place.

post,6jf7hf,2qh72,jokes,false,1498408083,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6jf7hf/chili_texas_style/,self.jokes,,"If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. This is a so called actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in Texas.

Note: Please take time to read this slowly. Read it all. Do not skip any sections. Do not skip ahead.

Pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better.

Note: For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off around Halloween. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park.



**CHILI, TEXAS STYLE !!!**

Note from Frank: ""Recently, while visiting Texas (I'm from Springfield, IL) I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light beer booth, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that even though I was inexperienced as a Chili taster, the chili wouldn't be all that spicy. Besides, they told me, I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.

Here are the scorecard notes from the event:

**CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.

**CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN'S AFTERBURNER CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

**CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting {censored}-faced from all of the beer.

**CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC**

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?

**CHILI # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER**

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.

**CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY**

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers and garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.

**CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.

**CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

Judge # 3 - No Report","CHILI, TEXAS STYLE!",28

- Be more or less specific.

From morning til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something.

The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.
One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.

He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch.

Immediately, his wife began pestering him. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.

All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.
At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement.

This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it. So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men.

The old farmer said, “Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I’d nod my head in agreement.”

“And what about the men?” the minister asked.

“They wanted to know if the mule was for sale.""",The farmer's nagging wife,268

The musician, not wanting to displease the Great Leader, did as he asked and got to work composing a piece of music. One week later, on the night of the performance, the musician accepted the applause and stood in front of the orchestra. He breathed in gently, smiled and looked around and prompted the musicians to begin playing.

They were AWFUL! They didn't play the music like it had been written, they were out of sync, out of tune, the strings were ahead of the wind instruments, the drummer seemed to have a mind of his own and the audience winced in pain.

Embarassed that he had told his dinner guests about the brilliance of North Korean musicians only to be greeted by this performance, Kim Jong Un immediately ordered the musician to be executed.

The guards came, and offered the musician a last meal before his execution. ""I'll have a hot curry,"" said the musician. When it arrived he ate it slowly and carefully - it was the hottest curry he had in a while, and then he sat in the electric chair to await his fate. The guards flipped the switch and smoked filled the room with sparks flying everywhere - but nothing happened - the musician was unharmed.

Impressed by the man surviving his ordeal, Kim Jong Un decided to give the musician another chance to impress him. The man thanked the Great Leader and got straight to work writing another piece of music.

""This is it!"" the musician thought as he finished crafting what was the most brilliant piece of music he had ever created. The big night came and again he stood in front of the orchestra.

He smiled, nodded and the orchestra began. It was WORSE than the first time. The brass sounded like shrieking cats, the wind instruments sounded like howling wind in a thunderstorm and the pace was too fast.

Angry that he had been embarrassed once again - the Great Leader called for execution. Again, the man asked for curry for his last meal. ""This time I'd like extra chilli,"" he said. So he ate his curry and sat in the electric chair. Again - sparks flew, smoke filled the room - but nothing happened. The man was unharmed.

Amazed that he was still alive, the Great Leader gave him a final chance. ""This had better be your best music ever!"" he warned the musician.

Humbly the musician thanked him, bowed graciously and left to compose his next piece. For weeks on end he laboured, changing notes, trying new variations, experimented with previously unheard variations to minor keys - until one day he had cracked it.

""This is my masterpiece!"" he cried. The night of the performance came - and again the man stood in front of the orchestra, looked around at them with the expression of a man who was sure nothing could go wrong and they began.

It was a COMPLETE DISASTER! They sounded even worse than the first two times. The audience left the Auditorium shrieking and covering their ears. Nothing in the history of humanity had ever sounded that awful.

""That's it!"" bellowed the Great Leader - ""Let's take you to be executed straight away. No curry, no last meal. This madness must be stopped!"" he exclaimed.

They took the musician away, strapped him into the electric chair, turned the voltage up to the maximum and waited.

This time, the sparks filled the room, a small fire started at the base of the chair, the smoke was dark and heavy and the musician started twitching in the chair.

""Finally,"" thought the great leader, ""that should do it."" But when the smoke cleared, the man was still alive smiling.

""But we didn't give you any chili,"" said Kim Jong Un.

""Oh, it had nothing to do with the chilli,"" the man said, ""I'm just a terrible conductor.""",There was this musician in North Korea....,28

When people needed a breath of fresh air, they had to step outside, and look for a road. However, three trees in particular had stood out for more than a recorded millennium in growing in an unplanted section of the town. These trees had seen the constructions and demolitions of many houses, the births and deaths of new town citizens, people moving in and people moving out, and many more shifts in the state of the town. The year was 1860, and Chicago was becoming involved in the civil war. Many chicagoans were being called in to serve, and nearly half of the able-bodied men of this particular suburb left. Mere weeks after the last of the would-be soldiers left, a legion of confederate soldiers approached the town. There was a warning from a neighboring town that in one day, a legion would invade. A panic ensued, with nearly all of the town not knowing what to do in the situation, as half of the potential soldiers were gone, and the rest could not possibly fight off the approaching confederates, but one clever folk had a rather strange solution: The three trees from off the sidewalk were old enough that they had enough branches to hide shotguns in. As there were a very limited selection of guns in the town at that time, they settled to use muskets. The problem was that there were not enough leaves and branches to hide any people in to shoot said muskets. The reconciliation from the clever man was a complicated pulley system to trigger the muskets and shoot at the confederates. The strongest men in the town were called to set identical systems up in all three trees, and they had finished them by evening. There was a single trigger for all three guns, so when pulled, three bullets would shoot into a very small area. The only reason this could work was that the soldiers were approaching the town from the direction of the trees, and as such would likely walk by them or in front of them. There was an explosive placed near the muskets’ firing location, so that it would likely be hit, creating the illusion that the bullets and explosion were from soldiers in the town. The explosive was strong enough as to injure at least two soldiers, but the explosion was small enough to not damage any town property. The town slept the night, and the next morning, there was relative unease throughout the entire town. There was an ad hoc plan already devised, which was that once the legion was spotted, all residents were to enter their houses and not exit until further notice, aside from one man; the planner. He was the one who was to trigger the muskets, using a rope that stretched to the nearest building. When the plan was over, it was a success, and the legion fled. However, the trees used for the plan were damaged by the explosion to the extent that they would soon die and rot quickly if not cut down. The town felled the trees, but the stumps remained, and a plaque was mounted on the stump of the largest, reading: 
Here once stood the tree musketeers.","Once upon a time, there was a town within Chicago.",4

I do physical labour.

I work at great depths.

I plunge head first into everything I do.

I do not get weekends or public holidays off.

I work in a damp environment.

I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation.

I work in high temperatures.

My work exposes me to contagious diseases.

Sincerely,
P. Niss

The Response:

Dear P. Niss:

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons:

You do not work 8 hours straight.

You fall asleep after brief work periods.

You do not always follow the orders of the management team.

You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.

You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.

You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.

You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing.

You will retire well before you are 65.

You are unable to work double shifts.

You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed assigned task.

And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.

Sincerely,
V. Gina",A letter from a Penis,25

One tragic day on the way home from Charlie's middle school woodcutting competition, they hit a pot hole, the tire blew, and the car went swerving violently into the only other lane on the two lane road. Charlie died on impact. Charlie's mother was thrown from the car and went into a coma. The man, although he wished he hadn't, survived without injury.

The man visited his wife every day at the hospital for the next two months. Constantly begging for forgiveness. He blamed himself for the incident, since he was driving. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. He didn't think he could go on.

Just when he felt like he couldn't take it any longer, his wife woke up. He felt a mixture of emotions he had never experienced before. Joy. Because the love of his life was alive and well. Dread. Because he would have to be the one to tell her about Charlie. Relief. Because he no longer had to carry this burden alone. And fear. Because of what his wife might think of him. Would she blame him as he had blamed himself?

He told his wife that their son had died in the crash, and she was devastated, of course, but she did not blame him. They began to rely on each other, growing closer through the pain they shared. The man knew he would never get over what happened, but having his wife made him think it just might be bearable.

Just when he was starting to come to terms with his new life and approaching something close to normalcy, the unthinkable happened. Apparently his wife had not been adjusting to their new situation with the same optimism as he had, because during the night one night, she killed herself.

""This is it."" The man thought. ""This is all I can bear."" He went to the barn behind their small country home and retrieved a rope. He then went into Charlie's room and sobbed for hours. He tied the one end of the rope around the rafters (Charlie's room used to be the attic, and the rafters were still exposed.) and the other around his neck as he stood on his beloved son's bed. He summoned all the courage he could to end his life, but just before he jumped, his eye caught all of Charlie's woodcutting projects. Upon seeing this he had a horrible, yet intensely motivational thought, ""Once I'm gone there will be little to no memory of Charlie."" He removed the rope from his neck and stepped down from the bed.

For the next year he learned wood carving. It became the entire reason for his being. He had a talent for it too, because, though he would never know, by the end of the year, he was one of the greatest wood carvers there has ever been. After mastering the art, he spent the next year building what would be his monument to Charlie, a wooden puppet made in his likeness. He worked and worked and worked, and by the end of that second year, it was complete. He loved it. It was the first time since Charlie's death that he could remember loving so passionately and powerfully. And this love truly was powerful because, as soon as he put the finishing touches on the puppet, it sprang to life. It startled him at first, but he soon realized that in addition to looking exactly like Charlie, it talked and acted just like him as well. And in that moment, it seemed to him that fate had given him a second chance in being a father.

He decided to name the puppet Chuck. He originally wanted to name him Charlie but decided there was only ever going to be one Charlie.  His and Chuck's love for one another grew daily. They did everything together except for one thing. The man always went by himself to chop wood because he was afraid for Chuck to be around wood cutting equipment for obvious reasons. One day the man didn't come back and Chuck immediately began to worry. He went to the place he knew his creator/father chopped the wood and started calling for him. Chuck heard him call back, which was a relief, but his voice sounded muffled. He tracked the voice to a well, and upon looking in he saw the man sitting at the bottom. He explained to Chuck that he had tripped while carrying wood and fallen into the well. As he fell his leg was cut open on a jagged rock and he had lost a lot of blood. Chuck threw the old rope down into the well, but before hardly any weight was put on it, it snapped due to dry rot. The situation was turning grim. It was dark in the well, but Chuck could see how pale his loving paternal figure had become. He looked around, frantically trying to figure out a way to save him. Then it came to him. There was an enormous pile of wood that the man had cut to make his carvings with. Chuck began heaving them into the well. 

At first the man was alarmed, but then realized what his created son was doing. As pieces were thrown into the well he could step on top of them bringing him closer to the opening at the top. It was difficult to do with his injured leg, but this new promise of survival, and more importantly being able to spend more time with his son, gave him the strength he needed. 

After almost an entire hour of constantly hurling wood into the well, Chuck died from exhaustion. Unfortunately the 262 pieces of wood that Chuck threw into the well, only allowed the man to reach just a few feet below the opening and he died of blood loss. But, with that, the old question was answered, ""How much wood would a wood Chuck chuck if a wood Chuck could chuck wood?"" 262 pieces exactly.",A man and a woman had a son named Charlie...,3232

We were 8 at the time. We weren't twins, but being so close in age we may have well been. 

The only thing...everything had to be equal. We fought like dogs if one got more than the other. He had a slightly bigger ice cream scoop than I did and I went ape shit. We had ice cream everywhere. 

My mom always had to intervene. And where she could, she'd tells us to split stuff. So we did. 

We went so far as to put a line of tape down the floor in our room. Which was funny; we acted like diplomats because the dresser was on my side and the closet was in his side. We'd time each other's stay in our borders. 

So one summer day we were in the pool and we started fighting over the floatie. 

Our mom came storming out: enough!  You guys are too much. Now split the pool!

Before I really thought about it I yelled: I get the top half!
