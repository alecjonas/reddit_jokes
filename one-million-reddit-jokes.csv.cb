We all have phone chargers. Some are 3 feet long, some are 20 feet long, and some are 2 *inches* long.

Our phones and our chargers are just two of the many many MANY different things we HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF in a society full of dangerous or helpful situations where you would need a charged phone in order to survive. Situations like calling emergency services, calling family members to say hello, and calling an Uber because your designated driver Jerry decided to go to the bar and down 20 shots of Everclear during Last Call.

In any case, as we all know, in order for our phones to stay on, we have to charge them once in a while. 

Now for a lot of us, the way we keep track of how much charge our phone has, is by a percentage that's displayed next to a battery logo. It's highly recommended that you locate your phone's charger when the battery reaches 15% of it's total charge.

Some people, like me, don't *immediately* reach for the charger when the battery reaches that percentage. That's because those people have a tendency to attach themselves to their phone and put off reaching for their phone charger until the very last minute when they actually need it.

These people are known as ""Charger Procrastinaters.""

The psychology of a Charger Procrastinater (CP for short) is a fairly simple and easy to understand concept that affects SO MANY PEOPLE, that I'm willing to bet many of you reading suffer from a mild or major form of this.

For the CP, at 15% charge, they will usually acknowledge the fact that their phone may need to be charged, but will make no attempt to connect their charger, even when they are sitting RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

At about 12-13%, the CP may consider locating the charger (if they haven't already), but will still make no attempt to connect it to their phone.

At 8-10%, the CP may consider connecting the charger, however, they will usually decline in favor of watching a few more YouTube videos or browsing a few more Reddit threads.

At 5%, the CP heavily considers plugging the phone charger into their phone, but the video isn't over yet, and they think they'll plug their phone in once its over, or there's more entertaining comments on the thread and they wanted to see a few more.

At 4%, the video is over, but the CP clicks on another to watch it in it's entirety, or they click out of a thread to find a way cooler one just a few scrolls down.

At 3%, the CP completely forgets that they were about to plug in the charger in the first place and keep themselves entertained...

And at 2%, a phenomenon happens that changes the CP's mind almost instantly and forces them to plug in the phone charger......



Many scientific studies have been published about this phenomenon, but none can quite explain it's incredible existence. Science has yet to solve and fix it, and even now the process is ongoing and moving at a very slow pace.

Scientists have coined a name for this experience...





They've called it ""The Oh $#!? Moment.""


At 2%, the CP scrambles to locate their charger in order to plug it into thier phone before it meets its untimely demise. If the CP is successful, they breathe a sigh of relief. If not, the CP defeatedly plugs in their phone and waits until the phone has enough charge to turn on.

The Charger Procrastinater is an interesting creature due to the fact that it's sole flaw is its inability to plug in its phone to its phone charger. Science isn't advanced enough to understand the existence of this phenomenon, and it probably never will, but I believe that with time, the Charger Procrastinater will eventually die out, and a new generation of reasonable plug inserters will look back in fond remembrance of the Charger Procrastinater and all its 2 percenting glory.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm at 2% right now and I can't seem to find my charger...

Thank you.",The Thing About How Charged Your Phone Is...,3

post,dng462,2qh72,jokes,false,1572107337,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dng462/the_creature_in_the_hotel_room/,self.jokes,,"A guy is driving back home to Edinburgh late from work one night. He's still got a long way to go - about 150 miles in fact, but he's already feeling incredibly tired. These last few nights have all been the same, to be honest. Every night he finds himself dragging his slumped body into bed for about four hours sleep, waking up and travelling to work again. It won't be for much longer, though, as he's already decided to quit and start somewhere new. But until then he's got to deal with the long hours and late nights.

But he's sick of it, and he decides that tonight he's not going to drive home. Tonight, he decides, he's just going to find a hotel and stay the night. Fortunately, almost by chance, the next turn off marks that there's a hotel.

After a winding country road that seems to go on forever, the road stops suddenly and the faint lights of a grand, five storey building glow atop a hill. None of this makes sense to the man; he's been driving this road for years and never knew there was a hotel here, nevertheless something as large and beautiful as this. The car park is empty, and the night is too still for his liking, but he's too tired to argue with the voice in his head that tells him something doesn't seem right.

He enters the grand foyer where a lone man stands to greet him.

""Hello, weary traveller. I imagine that you wish for a room. You are free to stay the night at no cost in one of our best suites. But there is one thing that you must do for me in return.""

The man, powerless to argue and his mind already imagining a nice warm King size bed, nods and asks what the thing is.

""Oh, nothing much my friend. You must simply refrain from doing what your impulses will want you to do when you enter the room. Inside the room is a cage, and inside the cage is something that you nor I can fully understand. But, and this is the important part, no matter how much you want to do it; you must not touch it. I repeat; DO NOT TOUCH IT.""

The man, startled, agrees and is shown to his room.

The room is lavish, indeed. Gold and oak flooring, columns of ivory notched marble, and a four poster bed. But, in the shadows where the lights dare not approach, is the silhouette of a hulking mass wrapped behind bars. Breathing. And watching.

The man goes to the bed and falls to his sleep, too tired to care. But, an hour or so later he awakes to hear the sounds of rattling. He turns and sees that the shadows in the cage are active - thrashing back and forth, rocking the cage. A voice in the man's head tells him to approach. He feels powerless because the urge to reach out and touch the creature is too great. And so he does.

The creature ROARS with might and rips the cage apart. The man has time to grab his car keys and run. He runs down the stairs as the grunting of the beast aporoaches.

ROOOOOOAAAAAARRR

He runs out of the front door. The roar fainter but nevertheless still chasing behind him. The creatures feet thump heavily as it snaps and bends the flooring below it.

RoooooaaaaaAAAR

He goes for his car. He gets in and starts the engine.

Rooooaaaarrrrrr calls out the beast, charging for his car 

He tears down the road, and for a moment he thinks he is safe.

RoooOOOOAAAAARRRRR

The beast jumps on top of his car and starts pounding. The man panics and turns his car off of the cliff edge onto the rocks below. As he drags his broken body out of the car and clambers over sea water and rock, he hears the noise that has been haunting him for what now seems like a lifetime.

ROOAAAARRRRRRR

The man turns to see the creature drop from the cliff above and stare at him. It begins to charge his way. The man, crying and begging for mercy, puts his arms out to protect himself, but he knows it is pointless. The creature towers over him and takes its prize.

ROOOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRR..... Tag, you're it!!! *Runs Away*",The Creature in the Hotel Room,0

post,dnd3to,2qh72,jokes,false,1572092108,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dnd3to/joes_talking_trees/,self.jokes,,"Joe was a simple and serious man. He was a carpenter in a small village named Arge Oaks where he owned the store ""Joe's Carpentry."" 

For years Joe impressed his fellow neighbors with the highest quality carpentry work. Some people in town complained he was a bit too expensive, but no one ever questioned the quality of his work. He was the best and business was good. 

In fact, it was so good that the other carpenters in town, jealous of his success, started to rename their stores to things like ""Joe's Woodworking"" and ""Joe's furniture"" in an attempt to steal his business. 

Furious with his fellow carpenters, and more than a little hurt, Joe formulated a plan. 

""I'll show them."" Joe said, muttering to himself. ""I'll go to the deepest part of the forest to find the best and most rare wood! Once I have it, I'll craft the most amazing piece of furniture ever built!!! I'll put it right outside my shop, so everyone knows who the rightful Joe is!"" 

Determined, Joe set off the next day at dawn. He went deeper into the forest than ever before, and then deeper still. After several days of hiking he came upon a clearing with three trees in the center. Amazed, he approached the trees with wonder; the wood was better quality than anything he had ever seen. 

""They're magnificent, these are exactly what I needed!!"" Joe exclaimed while reaching for his axe. 

""Why thank you Joe."" Said a gravelly voice. ""We have watched you for some time."" 

""Uh... wh.. who's there?"" Asked Joe, brandishing his axe and shaking with fear. 

""We are the Ents of the forest Joe, we tend to all the trees throughout our domain."" Said another voice, the same yet distinct from the first. 

Joe looked up into the trees, trying to find the source of the voices. Gazing into the branches he saw what appeared to be faces in the bark of each of the trees... angry faces. Their eyes were smouldering red, and they had furious scowls that only gnarled wood could produce. 

""You've been carving up our brethren Joe. YOU WILL SUFFER."" Said the Ents in unison and they attacked Joe with all their fury. 

""I didn't know!!! Please, spare me!"" Cried Joe, but to no avail. 

He was bludgeoned, scratched and beaten, but not defeated. Joe knew wood, he knew it well, and he had all the tools to chop down the toughest of trees. So he mustered his strength, and attacked with everything he had. Chopping, hacking, sawing, and breaking. All the while the Ents screamed at him with wild fury, seemingly possessed. Once Joe had gotten over his initial shock, he realized the trees were fairly slow, and it wasnt hard to avoid their attacks. Finally, after what seemed like days, the battle turned in his favor, yet the Ents continued their attack, even in the face of defeat. 

""Please, just calm down."" Joe said, exhausted. ""I dont want to hurt you anymo-"" A branch smacked him in the face, and he chopped it back. ""STOP! You guys are living miracles, I dont want to kill yo-"" *Whap* A small twig hit him right in the family jewels. Enraged and exhausted Joe's mind snapped. 

""I said, CALM DOWN! *chop* CALM DOWN! *chop* CALM DOWN! *chop*"" Every time he said calm down he chopped again and again with the axe, til nothing was left moving. 

""There,"" he whispered with a crazed look in his eyes ""you're calm now."" 

He started crying and whispering to the dead wood, begging it to talk again and apologizing while kissing the mangled branches. 

""You're ok, you're just calm now. I'll take you back home my friends."" Joe whispered maniacally. 

For weeks Joe dragged the dead Ents back to Arge Oaks. With each passing day he fell deeper into madness, whispering to the wood. 

When he finally returned to town, Joe rebuilt the Ents as much as he could and left them in front of his store. They were glorious works of art and the whole town gathered to ask Joe about his trees with faces. 

""They aren't trees!"" He snapped, his eyes roving crazily around. ""They are ents, and they can talk!!"" 

The crowd looked around uncertainly. 

""Well, why aren't they talking?"" Yelled a man in the back. 

""They are just calm."" Said Joe, kissing a trunk and whispering madness. Unnerved, the crowd dispersed. 

Joe kept making amazing furniture, better even than he used to, but he kept whispering to the ents and kissing them. Soon enough the people of the town stopped caring about his quirky way with the ents, ""It's just part of his wood-working genius"" they would say. Life got back to normal. 

About a month later a rich land owner came to the small village to commission the famous Joe for a elegant table. Looking around the village he saw three separate carpentry stores with Joe in the name. Baffled, he asked a local where he could find the actual Joe. 

The local raised an eyebrow and pointing towards Joe (who was stroking and kissing the rebuilt ents) the local said,
""Here in Arge Oaks, everyone knows that' the real Joe kissin the calm ents.""",Joe's Talking Trees,206

There was this little boy about 12 years old walking down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. He came up to the doorstep of a house of ill repute and knocked on the door. When the Madam answered it, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. 

He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money to buy it, and I'm not leaving until I get it.""

The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked.

He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?""

Of course the Madam said no.

He said, ""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making love with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want.""

Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right.

He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?""

He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant for dinner, leaving me at home with a baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of cute little boys. She will then get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, and HE'S the son-of-a-bitch who ran over my FROG!""",The frog,284

post,dn9mnm,2qh72,jokes,false,1572067468,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dn9mnm/the_cheerio_story/,self.jokes,,"They call it... the Cheerio Story

So there's this Cheerio walking down the street one day when he finds a magic lamp. He gives it a rub, and a genie popa out and says
&gt; Mortal Cheerio, for freeing me from my prison, I shall grant you three wishes.

The cheerio thinks on this... and he thinks... and he says: ""Genie, I have lived my entire life as a boring, plain, everyday, ordinary Cheerio, and things have not been going very well. I feel I could do better if I were just... something else. Genie, I wish to be.... a Honey Nut Cheerio.""

And so, the Genie turns our normal, boring, plain, everyday, ordinary Cheerio into a Honey Nut Cheerio, and his life instantly improves—albeit marginally. People take a liking to him, and he starts to gain friends for the first time in his life. Sadly, this is the extent of the changes. Thus, our Cheerio returns to the Genie, and the Genie asks:
&gt; Mortal Cheerio, have you decided on tour other two wishes yet?

Our Cheerio responds: ""Yes, Genie, you see... having now lived as a Honey Nut Cheerio, things have improved, but not as much as I had hoped. I feel as though I thought too small and wasted my wish... Genie, I think yet more could be out there for me if I were something else; I wish to be... a Chocolate Cheerio.""

And so, the Genie turns our Cheerio into a Chocolate Cheerio. He takes up a newfound interest in self-improvement and athleticism. He trains and trains for years, mastering every sport he learns. Eventually, he becomes an Olympian and wins all Gold for his nation. This fame and fortune is better than his life before, but he still feels something is missing in his life, yet he cannot determine just what it is. He returns to the Genie, and the Genie says:
&gt; Mortal Cheerio, have you decided on your third and final wish.

""Yes, Genie,"" our Cheerio replies, ""I have. I lived first as a boring, everyday, ordinary, plain Cheerio, and things were awful. Things had imrpoved as a Honey Nut Cheerio, and still improved further as a Chocolate Cheerio, but Genie.... I feel there is yet more out there for me if I were someone else. Genie, I wish to be... a Froot Loop.""

The Genie grants our Cheerio's third and final wish and naffs off on his own life, and our Cheerio's life changes one last time. He loses interest in athleticism and instead takes up acting. Using his fame and fortune from before, he quickly establishes himself in the industry and proves he has what it takes to be the top actor. Years pass, and he becomes the leading star in the big summer blockbuster movie. After the premiere, he attends the afterparty and talks to each of the guests. He sees the Genie at the party and thinks about talking to him, but first, he gets thirsty. So he walks over to get some water, hut there is a line at the water. So he goes to get some lemonade, but there is a line there, too. At last, he goes to get some punch, and there is no punchline.",The Cheerio Story,3

“All right, all right, this was not really fair” said  the gambler. “I will give you a chance to win your money back. I will  bet you another $1,000 that I can bite my other eye.”

IRS agent  looks over the guys paperwork and see that he is not legally blind and  takes the bet. The gambler takes out his dentures and bites his other  eye. The IRS agent is now visibly stressed and sweating for being on the  hook for $2,000.

“I tell you what. Double or nothing, I will  stand on the edge of your desk, close my eyes and piss into the garbage  can on the other side of the room without spilling a drop, what do you  say?”

IRS agent is a little perplex, but does not see how that  would be possible and takes the bet. The gambler stands on the agents  desks, unzip his pants, closes his eyes and pisses all over the agents  desk.

“YES!!!” exclaimed the IRS agent knowing he won the bet and does not own the gambler any money.

“Ahh, shiiiit” said the attorney.

“What’s the matter?” asked the IRS agent.

“Well, he bet me $20,000 that he will come to your office today, piss all over your desk, and you would be happy about it.”",A gambler gets a notice from IRS that he is being audited. (Long),57

This tribe are described as being performers of a legendary song and dance unlike any other that has only ever been observed once before. Excited, he studies the remaining few notes of the tribe's whereabouts in the report. After about a month he finally estimates where in Africa this tribe is located and that they should be still around today. A further month of planning comes with him arranging transport, supplies and equipment necessary to document these mysterious people. Then when the day comes and he is on the plane bound for Africa, his mind rushes around thinking about what this strange song and dance these people do. Unfortunately, the plane has an engine malfunction and starts to catch fire in flight!

The anthropologist is lucky enough to grab a parachute and escape through the exit, landing in the middle of nowhere. Days pass and he struggles to find food and water, and his mouth becomes drier and drier and his stomach groans louder and louder. Finally, when it feels like his final hour, he collapses in front of a village, which he recognizes as that of the mysterious tribe! He sees them all stand in the village center ready to perform their act, and despite him feeling his heart beat its final beats, a smile is spread on his face knowing his last moment will be a extraordinary one.

When they arrive at the Pearly Gates, St. Peter says to them, ""Congratulations; you made it into heaven! God has one rule,  however, which is: **YOU CANNOT STEP ON, KILL, OR TOUCH A DUCK.** If you do, you will be punished.**""**

The men think this is rather strange, but they agree.

A couple of days later, they decide to have a picnic.  It's a beautiful day; the sun is shining, the skies are blue, etc. As they lay down the blanket, one of the men sits on a suspicious-looking lump (which turns out to be a duck).

St. Peter appears instantly. ""**I GAVE YOU ONE RULE!**"", he bellows, ""And you could not follow it!? I have no choice but to punish you."" Despite the man's pleas, St. Peter continues, ""As punishment, you are now bound to the ugliest woman in heaven for all eternity!"" Both St. Peter and the man vanish.

The next day, the two remaining men take a walk in a park. One of the men doesn't look where he's going, and all of the sudden... *CRUNCH!* \- a duck has been stepped on.

As with the last time, St. Peter appears instantly. ""You know what I must do - you are now bound to the next ugliest woman in heaven for all eternity!""

Three years later, the final man is relaxing in his house, when out of the blue, St. Peter appears. Expecting something bad, the man gets on his knees and asks what St. Peter wants. he replies, ""Since you have been so good as to not touch a duck for the past three years, I will reward you by binding you to the most beautiful woman in heaven for all of eternity.""

As St. Peter describes her, the man really thinks she sounds gorgeous. He is so eager to meet her that he asks, ""When do I see her?"" St. Peter snaps his fingers, and *POOF* \- the man is meeting his soul mate. They talk for a while, until he says to her, ""You're so beautiful and smart and funny; what did I do to deserve you?"" The woman responds, ""I don't know; all I had to do was step on a duck!""

And the devil says: this pit is for the russians. Here, if someone tries to climb out, the guards shoot him and throw him back into the pit.

Next they see another huge pit full of hot tar, and people suffering. There are signs all around the pit.

And the devil says: this pit is for the germans. Here, if someone tries to climb out they notice the signs. The signs say ""Climb back!"" so they climb back immediately.

The man is amazed, but they go further, and see a third pit full of hot tar, and people screaming in pain. Curiusly, there seems to be nothing around this pit to keep people in.

she said, “I don’t feel like it. I just want you to hold me.”

I said, “WHAT?! What was that?!”

She said, “You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.”

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.
The next day I took off of work to spend time with her.

We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big department store.
I walked around with her as she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which one to take, so I told her we’d just buy them all.

She wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so I said, “Lets get a pair for each outfit.” We went on to the jewelry counter where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. She was so
excited. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet. I threw
her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey.”

She was nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, “I think this is all dear, let’s go to the cashier.”

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No baby, I don’t feel like it.”
Her face went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, “WHAT?”
I said, “Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”

Just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”

Being a kind priest, he took donations around town for the old man and raised $5,000.  He put it in an envelope and wrote on it ""From God"" and left it next to the tree when he saw the old man come visit again.

The next day, the old man came back and tied another letter to the tree.

The priest then came and took down the letter and read it excitedly.

""Dear God, thank you for sending me the money.  Next time, please send it to me directly as the priest can't be trusted, can you believe he took $95,000 of the money!""",One day an old man wrote a letter to God... [long],28

Relieved, he calmly walks down the stairs. The once crowded barroom is completely empty, not a soul was in sight. Slowly, a bartender rises from behind the bar.

“What happened!?!” says Banta.

post,dmsvps,2qh72,jokes,false,1571981457,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dmsvps/the_year_2192/,self.jokes,,"The year is 2192. The British Prime Minister visits Brussels to ask for an extension of the Brexit deadline.  He leaves a ceremonial letter. For reasons lost in time, this letter is always unsigned. Ceremonial garb includes a suit that looks like it was made for a someone of an entirely different size and possibly species, and a blond nylon wig that was placed in a tumble dryer for 30 minutes on the hottest setting. No one remembers where this tradition originated, but every year it attracts many tourists from all over the world.

Increasing the resolution of the picture we see:
Wearing the ceremonial blonde wig and a traditional black outfit with white stockings and with white shirt hanging out the back as though he has only just woken up, the British Prime Minister strides up to the main gates of the EU Council complex in Brussels. The main gates of the complex are shining brightly with gold leaf in the afternoon sun. The EU Council complex sprawls over 95% of the ancient city of Brussels and is resplendent from its pre-occupation renovation; just one of 32 city sized EU Council complexes, one for each of the member states of the Greater Federal European Union, which are occupied for 6 months  once every 16 years. The British Prime Minister carries a large black stick and a scroll tied with a red ribbon. The Prime Minister bangs hard on the gates three times which then swing open to reveal the President of the European Commission, the European Union's Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union and the President of the European Council all wearing their formal and expensively tailored Three Wise Men outfits. The British Prime Minister hands over the scroll, an unsigned letter, requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline for another six months. The Three Wise Men consider the letter carefully and then announce that they will only grant an extension if there is a good reason for it, whereupon they ask the PM for the reason for an extension. The PM formally shrugs his shoulders and says that he doesn’t think there is a good reason. The Three Wise Men consider this carefully and then grant an extension for a further 6 months. The crowd of onlookers  from around the globe cheer loudly and have a great laugh. The crowds of tourists then go and buy food and drink and commemorative presents for their relatives and friends back home. The income from this goes some small way towards offsetting the colossal expense of moving the EU council to a new location every 6 months.

TLDR; Brexit is a joke

Caught in the act, the two stop, and the nurse begs the old woman not to tell. “Please! You know they’ll fire me!”

The old woman stops and thinks. She and her husband haven’t had sex in years. A new position like this could really help get things  going again, so she makes the nurse a deal. “I won’t tell, but you’ve got to train me how to do this, so I can try it with my husband.”

The nurse is skeptical, but desperate to keep her job, she agrees.

For months, the old woman and the nurse practice stretching. Finally after huge effort, the old woman manages to get one leg behind her head.

The two continue practicing. Month after month they work on it, stretching, training, slowly getting better. Finally, one day, the old woman manages to get both legs behind her head.

That night, finally ready to surprise her husband with her new ability, the old woman strips down and hops on her bed to get ready for when he returned to their room.

Slowly, slowly she puts one leg behind her head. Slowly, slowly she puts the other one up, too. 

She hears her husband at the door, but in her excitement she slips and rolls on to her back.

Doctor 1: I don't know if you fellas noticed, but we've been losing a lot of patients in that room. 

Doctor 2: I've noticed that too, and is always at 10am. 

Doctor 3: Yes, what's up with that? I lost three people who had very good chances of recovery, alwalys at 10am.

Doctor 4: I have a patient there right now, and is almost 10am, how about we stay in the room to see what's happening?

So the 4 doctors go to the ICU and wait until the clock hits 10am. 

When it does, Joe the janitor enters the room, drag his vacuum cleaner and unplugs the life support system to power the thing.

Without believing their own eyes, the doctors watch as Joe meticulously vacuums the room, until one of the doctors snaps out and unplug the vacuum, plug the life support and save the patients lives.


-Hey, - said Joe - what's up with that, doc?

-Are you *nuts*? What about the patients?

-What? You expect me to vacuum them *before* they're cremated?

All was well for a month or two, but Sam was getting very sexually frustrated. He asked another crew member what they did when they were so horny, and the guy gestures to the camels that were kept nearby, and said that’s what the camels were for. My friend was horrified and would not listen to the other crew member describe just how the camels were used. Another few weeks went by, and Sam began really looking at the camels. Most were smelly and huge, but there was one smaller female that caught his eye. She seemed cleaner, very docile, and had these long eyelashes, with a bit of a coquettish look to her face. Another couple of weeks, and Sam found himself spending quite a bit of his off time grooming and, well, fondling this sweet girl. One night the pent up frustration and easy availability of the camels finally convinced him it would not only be ok, but could actually be a beautiful, mind blowing experience. He brought a short ladder, and led the lovely young lady away from the pack, whispered to her was gonna treat her right, and set up his ladder. But as he began his foreplay, just a little tease with his fingers and hand, she bit, kicked, stomped on him and ran off. When the other guys heard the ruckus, they came running to find my friend, heart broken, bleeding and in shock at the rejection.  He asked the crew what he did wrong, and they said, “well, when we get frustrated, we usually just ride the camels to town.”",So my friend Sam got a job with a large oil company to work oil fields in the Middle East.,8

Most recruits wash out early. Some... Not so early. The training lasts years, and you can wash out at any time. 

It was the last day of training, right before graduation, when the news came down, one of the cadets was being kicked out. 

By this point they were all already officers, so they let him pick any duty assignment in the air force he wanted... Anything but being a pilot. 

So, given the choice of any post, he considered a post at a large Air Force Base in the desert, with a pool, a movie theater, a gym... Or a post at a smaller base in a big city, where he could go out when off duty and visit the clubs, restaurants, and enjoy the beach...

Finally, he decided. He wanted to be a mobile deployment officer. 

Shocked, they asked him, ""Why? You'll spend all your time either setting up camp, positioning equipment, or breaking down camp and packing up equipment. You'll sleep in tents, and you won't even have a proper shower for weeks.""

He smiled and replied, ""Because thats where the surface to air missiles are. If I'm not gonna fly, no one is.""",An old joke I heard from an Israeli fighter pilot...,20

I had just gotten in a fight with my wife, and yes, I might have had a little too much to drink and a little too poor a sense of direction to be doing what I was doing. Cacti and tumbleweeds blurred past me as I tried my best to ignore the clunking sound coming out from under the old Wrangler's hood. One stretch of road blended into the next. As the road got bumpier, I realized I wasn't even on a road after all, but rather wandering the desert on an uncharted course.

*SLORTCH!* A sickening crunch sent me and my battered mount spiraling and screeching over the coarse, sandy dunes. Sand got everywhere. The Jeep rammed into a dune with a *THUD* and I blacked out.

*""FOOL OF A CROOK!""* I heard in a thunderous voice. I looked around, panicked. My legs were caught under some Jeep guts that had spilled all over me. I couldn't move. *""Are all you humans this stupid, or are you an extra rare shiny specimen?""*

""What?! Who's there? What's going on?"" was all I could spew from my confused mouth.

*""I am Na'thwhqangq'yi, though those of your kind often call me Nathaniel. Do you not know what you nearly crashed into?""*

Still looking around, I shrugged. ""A wedding party?"" I offered. Out of the corner of my eye, a slimy silver snake slithered silently into view. 

""Ahem. Do you see any extravagant mate pairings in the vicinity? You're hardly doing anyone any favors.""

Staring into his beady little eyes, I was shocked to realize that the voice was coming from the snake! It seemed to be some kind of telepathic ability. Not only that, he had lowered his voice now that he was closer.

""Well, *Nate the Snake,*"" I quipped, ""it's not like you've exactly been handing out favors either! What are you, anyway? Some kind of Area 51 experiment?""

Despite the stupidity of my remarks, I heard something like a muffled chuckle. ""Nate the Snake... I like that. What I am is very old, and beyond your mortal understanding. But I have been imprisoned within this serpentine body for the purpose of guarding the Terminus Obelisk. It is one spoke of a wheel that, when turned, will ignite ancient flames within this planet that will destroy everything on it. And above it. And outside it, in dimensions you cannot imagine.""

""Huh... and what are the other spokes of this wheel? What does that metaphor even mean?"" I asked.

Nate the Snake scoffed. ""It's literally a wheel, pal. See that stick over there? In the mud?""

I looked over at some kind of branch-looking thing protruding from a mud pit nearby. A stick in the mud. 

""I'm not your pal, guy! The name's Jesse. So... you're telling me if I had hit that switch over there, the entire universe and beyond would have ended?""

Nate nodded sagely. ""A stick. A switch. An on/off button for existence, if you will, but more of a lever than a button.""

I snapped ""I'm not Will, I'm Jesse! Pay attention, geez.""

Again, that stupid sexy chuckle. ""Well I'm not Geez, either! Nate the Snake, remember?""

""Right. By the way, help a pal out and get my legs free, please? I'm not a badass snake like you. I really need to pee.""

The car parts holding me down dimly glowed and were lifted from my legs. I thanked Nate heartily and tried to get the Jeep started. No luck.

Finding I was stuck here, in the middle of the desert, I did what any sane man would do: make conversation with Nate the Snake. I found out he'd been guarding this Obelisk thing for centuries. It really didn't look like an ""obelisk"" to me, though, so I just started calling it the Lever of Doom, and it stuck. 

When I got thirsty, Nate was kind enough to lead me to a nearby spring hidden just under a dune that I would have completely missed otherwise. As I drank greedily from the spring, I talked to Nate about my life and my problems.

Despite coming off as a bit of a jerk at first blush, Nate was actually pretty interested in my life. Turns out women in lakes handing out swords is no basis for government, but ancient spirits in snakes handing out advice is an excellent basis for turning your life around. We talked for hours and hours about my wife, Jamie, how all the little times I pissed her off had added up, how she rearranged my things only because she loved me and wanted to clean up the place.

Days passed as I tried to fix the Jeep and failed. No cell reception. I had no idea where the nearest town was. Nate the Snake took pity on me and helped guide me to some wild berries that kept me fed near that mysterious hidden spring. We talked more - about how I felt I was at a dead end at my job, about the career I wanted to pursue and how my manager seemed so much more selfish than other managers in my division. We talked about his abilities, and he showed me some more of the mystical secrets of the desert. He gave me a killer flan recipe. It was all information that I would later take to improve my life immeasurably.

Eventually, I found out what was stopping the Wrangler from starting. With a few zaps from Nate, the engine roared to life.

""I'm going to miss you, Nate the Snake. I feel like we really connected these past few weeks.""

""And I you,"" Nate replied. ""But this needn't be goodbye forever. Return to this desert, take a left, then a right, and repeat. When you are wandering, when you are lost, you can find me and we can chat once more. However, you must promise ne that you will never tell anyone about the Lever of Doom."" 

I took his blessing and warning to heart. Can't believe I even got the old coot to call it the Lever of Doom, too.

And return to him I did. Over the years, as he said, whenever I felt lost in life, I would return to the desert, play the left-right game, and find warm-blooded counsel from Nate. He helped me find solace after my first divorce; he held me stable when the market crashed and I felt totally responsible for it; I bought some guns and helped him defend the Lever of Doom from void-faced legions from Hell. Nate became my dearest friend in life.

One last day, in my hairs of gray, I took one last drive in the deserts of Nevada. I drove my 1989 Jeep Wrangler, repaired multiple times over the years, like I had many times before. As always, I played the left-right game.

I was glad to see Nate's figure in the distance as my Jeep approached. Old friend, one final visit from me.

*Clunk!* 

Uh oh.

That was not a sound my Jeep should have made.

I slammed on the brakes, but nothing happened. The engine roared faster and faster. I was directly on a collision course with the Terminus Obelisk! That stupid little stick in the mud that could destroy the universe. Sweating, I knew I had to make a split second decision... but I knew Nathaniel would never forgive me if I didn't do it.

At the last minute, I swerved into my dearest friend, killing him instantly, and yelled,

*BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!*",I was driving in the desert in my 1989 Jeep Wrangler.,114

There was this beautiful women assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me a package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, “No, this is my first time.” So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty. “Just a minute,” she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. “Do these excite you?” She asked. Well, I was dumb-struck that all I could do it nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on the desk. “Well come on,” she said , we don’t have much time.” So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.  She looked at me with a bit of a frown. “Did u put that condom on ?” She asked . I said , I sure did”, and held my thumb up to show her.",My first time buying condoms,55

He decided to ask to stay the night. The monks were welcoming and gave him a room to stay in. In the middle of the night, the man woke to hear strange, beautiful, haunting music. It captivated him. He lay still, crying for the whole hour in which it played. The following morning, he approached the head monk and asked ""where did that strange, beautiful, haunting music come from? I must know."" The monk refused. ""I cannot tell you because you are not a monk."" Disappointed, the man fixed his car and went home.

The following year he attended another conference in the same town. On the way back, he decided to ask to stay in the monastery again. He was welcomed warmly, given a room and awoke in the middle of the night to hear the strange, beautiful, haunting music. He approached the head monk again to ask where it had come from. Again he was told ""I cannot tell you because you are not a monk""

And so this repeated, year after year. The man would visit the monastery and lie in tears as he listened to music. No matter how hard he pleaded with the head monk, he got the same answer each time. ""I cannot tell you because you are not a monk"". After seven years, the man decided that there was only one thing he could do. He would become a monk.

Seven years of monk training followed. The man then returned to the monastery on the hill and asked the head monk about the music. The monk said ""it would be best if I show you"". The monk brought out a set of keys. The first key was small and plain. The second was large and bronze. The third was even larger and silver. The fourth key was huge and golden. The monk led the man to a small, plain door and unlocked it with the first key. They passed through a bronze chamber, then a silver chamber and finally a golden chamber, unlocking each with the corresponding key. Finally, the monk unlocked the final golden door and the man discovered the source of the music. But I cannot tell you what he saw because you are not a monk.","A man went to a conference in a rural town. On the way back, his car broke down.",93

The three men band together and set off in search of civilisation. After many hours trekking through the jungle the men come across 3 rotting dead birds. 
“I’m not eating that!” Says a disgusted Edward. 
“Aye it’s covered in maggots!” Replied Jock. 
Paddy however shrugged and said “beggars can’t be choosers lads!” And devoured the lot. 
After several more hours of trudging through the jungle the men find a nest full of human eyeballs. Edward dry heaves while a shocked Jock proclaims “some bird must have collected them from the dead in the crash” and says a quiet prayer. Paddy however, completely unperturbed, grabbed a handful and gobbled them right up, “well they’re not using them now!” He said. 
The men carry on their search for aid through the jungle and suddenly hear the sound of running water. Elated, a parched Edward and Jock rush towards the sound. Paddy however, rubs his belly thinking he’s getting hungry again, strolls casually behind. He follows the men and comes across Jock kneeling beside a river consoling a screaming Edward. 
“What’s happened here!?” Asks Paddy. 
“Edward went to take a drink from the river! But as soon as he put his hands in a piranha latched onto his finger and bit it off!” Cries Jock. 
Looking around, Paddy sees the fish flopping around on the ground. He walks over, picks up a rock and cracks it over the head. Then without missing a beat he devours the whole thing! 
“YOU BASTARD!” Screams Edward. “My finger was in there!” 
“Sure I thought it was a bit chewy.” Chuckled Paddy. 
Then all of a sudden a jeep burst through the brush with “RED CROSS” plastered across the side of it. Medics jumped out and ran across to tend to the three men. Patching up Edward’s hand, and treating other wounds on them. 
“Alright. Let’s get out of here” said the medic in charge. “You guys must be starving, there’s some food in the jeep!” Jock and Edward begin to cry with delight, thanking the medics. 
Paddy however shrugs again and says “No thanks there. I’m stuffed. Good jungle this. I had Birds Eye Fish Fingers!”",3 men survive a plane crash in the jungle.,3

When he reached his twentieth year, his father commanded him to take a wife, but after numerous sumptuous matchmaking banquets he still hadn't found a woman that stirred his passion.

Tired of failure, and fearing that his father would make the choice for him if he dallied, Alladeen started mingling with the common people at his father's hotels. Night after night, he trolled the lobbies and casinos, until finally he saw Her.

The instant he laid eyes upon her, he knew he would love no other as long as he lived. She was obviously foreign - blonde and fit, with porcelain skin and a perfect face. Alladeen approached this vision of beauty and they hit it off immediately, laughing and talking late into the night as though they had known each other for years rather than hours.

Samantha was everything he needed, everything he wanted - but she defied every one of Allah's precepts. She wore revealing clothing, confided in Alladeen that she'd had a dozen sexual partners (both men and women) and clearly spent a lot of time every morning styling her hair and applying makeup.

Samantha returned to Alladeen's room every night for weeks.  When his father discovered the relationship, he was furious. He had armed guards drag her out of the hotel, and ordered Alladeen never to see her again.

Alladeen took his private funds and fled. He spent days searching for his lost love, but the city was vast and as days passed his hope dimmed. Eventually, he hired a team of private investigators to track her down.

Husband tells wife he is going on a business trip and will be back in a week. Wife says hell no what am I supposed to do without you being here “I need that D”. Husbands says ok I will go buy you a dildo. 

Husband goes to a sex shop. Haitian woman at the front says what can I help you with. Husband tells her he’s looking for a dildo for his wife. She shows him all of her options but it just wasn’t what he was looking for. Lady goes to the back and brings out the biggest dildo she has. She said this should fill any appetite. Husband says no he needs something special since his wife has an insane sexual appetite. 

Husband starts looking around and ask the lady what’s that box on that top shelf. Lady gets flustered “no sir I can’t show you that, that is a special thing and only certain people can handle it” husband is intrigued and says no I want to see it. 

The lady grabs the box. Pulls out the dildo and puts it on the counter. The husband says wow that’s big but I don’t see anything special with this. Lady says oohhh let me show you. She says “voodoo dick start dancing” the dick perks up and starts dancing on the table. Husband is amazed. She says voodoo dick only answered to his name so if you get it be sure to always be careful and Always say Voodoo Dick Before a command or it just won’t work.  He says Sold!!! I want it and go ahead and throw in one of the massive dildos for my wife while I’m on vacation. 

The husband returns home and shows his wife the massive dildo he bought her while he goes away on business. She is so excited! Later that night he tells her I bought something special for us. This is for when I’m tired and don’t feel like having sex. He tells his wife to lay down and he grabs the box. He says “voodoo dick fuck my wife” The voodoo dick jumps out the box and gives his wife the best fucking she has ever had. He then whispers voodoo Dick stop, voodoo dick stops and he puts it back in the box. They use it a few more times and the husband tells her now that I’m heading out on this trip DO NOT Open the box until I get back.

The husband leaves and she uses the massive dildo but she just can’t get the same orgasm as using the voodoo dick. She pulls out the box and says I will just use it and put it back and my husband will never know. She says “voodoo dick fuck me” The dick starts plowing that pussy and she’s having the most amazing orgasm ever. She finishes and says stop but voodoo dick does not. She doesn’t know what to do so she starts screaming STOP, STOP PLEASE STOP. Voodoo dick will not stop. She gets scared and jumps in her car while she’s speeding to the hospital the voodoo dick keeps plowing that pussy.

Knowing that he didn’t want to pass up this opportunity, he shows up to the ring, 45 minutes early.

“Doctor,” he asked, in total frustration, “is there anything you can do for me?”

The doctor replies, “Medically son, there is nothing I can do.  But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you.”

So the doctor gives him directions to the witch.

The man calls upon the witch and relays his story. “Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help.  Can anything be done to help me?  You’re my last hope!”

The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, “I think I may be able to help you.

Do this.  Go deep into the forest.  You will find a pond.  In this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log.  This frog has magic.  You say to the frog, will you marry me?  When the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem.”

The man’s face lit up and he dashed off into the forest.

He called out to the frog, “Will you marry me?”

The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, “NO.”

The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter.

“WOW,” he screamed out loud, “This is great!”

But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again.  “Frog, will you marry me?” the guy shouted.

The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, “NO!”

The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter.

The man laughed, “This is fantastic.”

He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment.  15 inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.

Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, “Frog will you marry me?”

The frog looked back across pond shaking its head, “How many times do I have to tell you?…

…  NO, NO, NO""",A man with a 25 inch long penis goes to his doctor…,38

They had no answer.

It is still pretty light out and the drug store is only a few miles from his house on the graveyard property, so he decides the walk might do him some good. 

Unfortunately, it takes him a while to gather the medicines he thinks he might need and the checkout line is longer than normal. He buys some cold medicine, some pain killers and some cough drops for the next day. 

When he is finally done, he heads home. It is now quite dark and a chill has set in so he is not in the best of spirits. 

When he makes it back to the graveyard, a cloud passes in front of the moon. Luckily he knows the graveyard well and can navigate it without a problem. 

It's quiet and he hears a noise behind him.

thump thump thump

He looks around but can't see anything in the dark. He quickens his pace.

He hears the sound again, but louder.

THUMP THUMP THUMP

He is genuinely frightened now and starts to run. 

The sound grows louder still.

###THUMP THUMP THUMP

As he's running, he glances back and the moon emerges from behind the clouds. To his horror, he sees a coffin, standing on end, bounding towards him.

##THUMP THUMP THUMP

He breaks into a sprint and slams the gate to his yard shut as he passes by. The coffin breaks through the gate, unhindered. 

#THUMP THUMP THUMP

He slams the door to his house and frantically locks it. The coffin breaks down the door.

#THUMP THUMP THUMP

He scrambles to the end of the room and knocks a table over to block it's path. The coffin breaks through the table.

#THUMP THUMP THUMP

He cowers against the wall, sure that his fate is sealed. In a last ditch effort, he tosses the cough drops at it. 

And the coffin stops.",This is the only joke I know. Spooktober appropriate.,249

""$101,237.64""

""What the hell did you sell?!?""

""First I sold him a bag of #8 fish hooks, then I sold him a bag of #1 fish hooks, then I sold him a set of lures. I then sold him a new fishing rod. After I asked where he was going fishing and he told me he was going to the coast, I told him he would be best off with a boat, so I brought him over to the sea craft department and sold him that 24' twin engine Yamaha. He was doubtful that his Silverado could manage it, so I took him down to automotive and got set him up with the 4x4 F350.""
