post,6s822f,2qh72,jokes,false,1502135196,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6s822f/aboriginal_rituals/,self.jokes,,"A couple years back, I stumbled on a surprising reference to the astonishing longevity of Aboriginal shamans living in the Australian outback. Reliable birth records aren't available before the early 20th century, but government officials have noted an astounding number of nonagenarians and centenarians. And anthropologists report--but, of course, discount--stories of village elders living for 150 years, 200 years, or more.

There are weirder stories, incredible enough to be consigned to footnotes in academic texts: that the shaman of Jimbilum arrived in that community in 1872, already impossibly old, and was dispensing advice, justice, and herbal remedies well until the late 1990s. His cause of death is assumed to be exposure: he left the village one night and was never seen again. Implausibly, residents of Ngunulum claim that their shaman--who, again, departed without a word, some time in early 1960s--claimed to have been personally acquainted with William Dampier, a man who last set foot in Australia in 1688.

I try to be careful with extreme claims, so I'm not going to say that every Aboriginal shaman is immortal. I will, though, go so far as to say that there's not a single verifiable case of one of them dying.

It gets stranger.

Like many traditional faith healers, shamans follow a number of special rules and taboos. You have the usual prayers, incantations, and prohibitions, and one especially odd dietary fixation: shamans insist on drinking a broth made by boiling water and adding chunks of koala meat.

This is not a minor rule. The departure of the shaman of Jimbilum, for example, coincided with the Australian Department of Environment's launching of a poaching investigation. Ngunulum's spiritual leader left after a long drought led to the death of the region's last remaining koalas.

There is no record of an Aboriginal shaman dying; there is no record of an Aboriiginal shaman going a day without drinking water that's been steeped in koala flesh and boiled.

I had to investigate.

You're familiar with the Dark Web, right? (Don't kid me--of course you are.) I opened an account on one of the lesser-known sites, one that ignored narcotics and credit cards, in favor of more exotic goods. For .275 bitcoin (shipping included), I had a sample of freshly-harvested koala meat en route.

After two weeks, I was pretty sure I'd been had. And pretty sure I deserved it, too. How much time and money should a grown adult spend investigating third-hand reports--and violating endangered species laws on several continents, to boot?
But then, on Monday, a package arrived. Lumpy, misshappen, sealed with three different kinds of tape, it felt strangely heavy and cool to the touch.

I opened it.

The roiling steam looked a lot less dramatic when I realized that, obviously, when you ship meat intercontinentally, you pack it with dry ice.

The koala looks smaller on your kitchen counter than it looks in pictures. I've seen lots of pictures of koalas, and always thought they looked cute, but never tasty. The impression doesn't improve in person.

But it was too late to turn back. I'd already set some water to boil. I stashed most of the koala in the freezer, and sliced off a toe.

In 1927, anthropologist Ursula McConnel recorded a list of rituals of the Wik Mungkan. Among them, the ceremonial boiling of a water infused with koala bits. Exactly 1.2 liters, exactly 3 hours. I followed her recipe to the letter.

And it was DISGUSTING. The foulest, nastiest thing I'd ever tasted. It coats your tongue and lacerates your nostrils and the taste stays with you for hours and the memory is with me still. If this was the route to immortality, maybe dying was a better option.

But I wasn't finished with my research. I pored over my books and papers, looking for more information on the ritual, and found that it was, in fact, permissible to fiddle with the recipe. Shamans in different regions had different spins on the concoction: as long as you boiled the water long enough, and used genuine koala, the other ingredients didn't matter.

After some experimentation, I've found exactly the right mix of flavorings to make it about as tasty as any other beverage.

I guess you could say this really improved my koala tea of life.",Aboriginal Rituals,72

A Harvard grad with a PhD (we'll call him John) and a redneck with a 5th grade education (we'll call him Bubba) are in a contest, and at the end of this contest (the type doesn't matter), their scores are tied. The host of the contest informs the two men that to break the tie, they'll have 5 minutes to come up with a 4-line poem that must use a word that he's about to reveal to them, upon which the judges will decide who has the best poem. He them gives them the word--Timbuktu--and the 5 minutes starts. When the time is up, the host asks John for his poem, upon which John recites the following:
Across the hot and dusty sands
rides a desert caravan
Men on camels, two by two
Destination: Timbuktu

The crowd watching the contest erupts with cheers and everyone just assumes John has this contest in the bag. When the cheers subside, the host asks Bubba for his poem, upon with he recites the following:

The first does a total makeover.
She goes to a fancy beauty salon, gets her hair done, new makeup; buys several new outfits and dresses up very nicely for the man. She tells him that she has done this to be more attractive for him because 
she loves him so much.
The man was impressed.

The second goes shopping to buy the man gifts.
She gets him a new set of golf clubs, some new gizmos for his computer, and some expensive clothes. As she presents these gifts, she tells him that she has spent all the money on him because she loves him so much.
Again, the man is impressed.


The third invests the money in the stock market.
She earns several times the $5,000. She gives him back his $5,000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much.

Obviously, the man was impressed.


The man thought for a long time about what each woman had done with the money he'd given her.


Then he married the one with the biggest boobs.

SL: It's logical. He wants to make love to us.

""God, I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I've never flown and am afraid to. I would really like it if there were a bridge so I could drive over there on my next vacation.""
God responded,""I can do that. I can. But it would really take away from all this beauty I have spent all this time creating. Is there anything else you would rather have?""

when he notices a sign out of the corner of his eye... It reads:SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 10 MILES He thinks this is a figment of his imagination and drives on without second  thought. Soon he sees another sign which read SISTERS OF ST FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 5 MILES. 
Suddenly he begins to realize that these signs are for real and drives past a third sign saying SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - NEXT RIGHT His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive. On the far side of the parking lot is a stone building with a small sign next to the door reading: SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS
He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks,
'What may we do for you! My son? He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly doing business....' 'Very well my son. Please follow me.' 
He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.' He does so and another nun in a long habit, holding a tin cup answers the door. This nun instructs, 'Please place $100 in the cup then go through the large wooden door at the end of the hallway.' 
He puts $100 in the cup, eagerly trots down the hall and slips through the door pulling it shut behind him.The door locks, and he finds himself back in the parking lot facing another sign: GO IN PEACE.

A ""friend of a friend"" put him in touch with a nefarious underworld figure, who went by the name of ""Artie."" Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out a spouse was $5,000. The husband said he was willing to pay that amount, but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's insurance money.

Artie insisted on being paid in part up front. The man opened up his wallet and displayed the single dollar bill that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.

A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Costco grocery store. There, he surprised her in the produce refridgerator and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands. As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the scene. Unwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

Artie was caught and arrested before he could leave the store.

Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the sordid plan, including his financial arrangements with the hapless husband.

And that is why, the next day in the newspaper, the headline declared: ""Artie chokes two for a dollar at Costco vegetable refrigerator.""",Recent crime perpetrated at Costco,33

""Hmmmm..."" said the doctor.  ""This is more serious than I thought.  Tomorrow try two pills in his coffee.  But be careful -- they are powerful.""

The woman does as he says, but to no avail.  Nothing changes.  On the third morning, she says, ""Fuck it!  I'm going to dump the rest of the bottle of pills in his coffee.  If that doesn't work, it's hopeless!""  So she does just that.

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much. I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it. On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.' When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep - I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

The teacher replied, ""Right now, we are learning addition."" The mother asked, ""And are you teaching them to say two plus two, that son of a bitch is four? Because that's what little Johnny keeps saying. He must have learnt it at school, since I don't teach addition at home!”

After the teacher stopped laughing, she replied, ""Let me show you what we are teaching at our school. Then you can decide where he is learning the phrase from.”

The teacher takes Johnny’s mother into the classroom, where the kids are clearly saying,”two plus two, the sum of which is four.”",Addition's a son of a bitch,200

Since the two were so close, the man decided to let his grandfather drive his beloved machine. 

On the highway, the grandfather was driving in excess of 200kph, and was pulled over. Never being pulled over before, the man was freaking out, but the grandfather simply said, ""Don't worry, I can get us out of any ticket. Just shut the hell up."" 

The officer pulls up to the driver's window, and asks for the car's registration, as well as the grand father's license. The grandfather responds, ""I'd love to give you those papers, but frankly I can't, as this is a stolen vehicle."" 

The officer responds, ""Well, that's not very good. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?"" 

The grandfather simply says, ""There's also one loaded gun in the glove box, one in each door jam, and one under each seat."" 

The officer asks the men to step out of the car, and handcuffs the pair. After the two have been sat down by the police car, the officer again asks, ""Sir, is there anything else I'm unaware of?"" 

Again, the grandfather says, ""Why yes, actually. There is a dead body in the trunk, so frankly I'm in a bit of a hurry."" 

Mortified, the officer calls for backup so they can search the car together. He arrives, and the original officer informs his partner of the situation.

After the two officers search the car, the officer's partner comes up to the two men and says, ""My partner informed me that you told him you had guns everywhere, a dead body, and all of this in a stolen vehicle without a license. However, all we found was your license in your coat pocket, and that the vehicle is registered to this young man right here. What the hell is going on?""

They set out a blanket and delicious food and proceed to have a truly memorable family afternoon.

Without a gust of wind or cloud in the sky, they all fall fast asleep after their meal, to the sound of chirping birds and cute little forest dwellers.

Time goes by, and the little boy wakes up. He looks around and can't see his mom and dad anywhere. He begins to panic and cry and yells out, ""Mommy! Daddy! Where are yoooouuu!?!??"" He notices how close they are to the cliff and with a heavy heart looks over the edge. The site is horrible and the little boy is devastated. Down below on the rocky bottom are his parents, dead...blood everywhere...just an absolute hellish site.

Just then, a man comes out of the bushes and sees the little boy crying. He walks up to him and asks:

""Hey little guy, what's wrong???""

The little boy replies:

""My mommy and daddy and me came to have a picnic and after I wake up I see mommy and daddy at the bottom and they died!!!"" The boy can hardly keep it together. 

The man looks over the cliff and sure enough the little boy's parents are at the bottom.

""I'm afraid this happens sometimes in jokes,"" says the doctor, ""and frankly you got off lightly. You reached the limit of what the laws of physics allow for and hit the fourth wall.""

""Does this mean I can never get any faster?"" The sprinter asks.

""Exactly. You've gone beyond what any human has ever achieved but now your foot is lost. I can give you a good prosthetic and some physiotherapy but you'll never be as fast as you were. Perhaps it would be best to retire from running.""


""But I am a sprinter!"" exclaims the sprinter, ""If I dont sprint, I'm not anyone! No invisible wall is getting the better of me!""


After months of physical therapy and retraining himself all over again, sheer force of will puts the sprinter back on the track and ready to beat his previous time. 

The sprinter sets off again, and runs harder and faster than he even managed before, when- THUD. He sees his body smash into the invisible wall, blood and limbs spread everywhere. ""Not again!"" the sprinter screams, as everything goes dark and he passes into a coma.


He wakes up in hospital, weeks later. He can't see whatever's left of his body under all the plaster and tubes everywhere.


""Not you again,"" says the doctor. ""Somehow we've managed to reconstruct most of your body from the mess you made on the wall and we had a team of engineers take care of the rest. But even if you can do this you really shouldn't, I don't know if I can fix you again.""


Completely undeterred, the sprinter, now almost more machine than man, continues training to be even better than he was. He has his cyborg legs upgraded and improved upon, and trains his body ten hours a day every day for eight years.


It's the big day. The story's gotten out and the sprinter now appears in front of a stadium of thousands as the world gathers to watch his third attempt to get through the fourth wall.
Equipped with a titanium exoskeleton and battering ram, the sprinter takes his mark for his third and final showdown with the fourth wall.


As he speeds up, his life flashes before his eyes, he remembers being the fastest kid on the playground and how everything he's done since then has led up to this moment- the fastest being on Earth, facing his ultimate challenge- his destiny will be decided here and now. He will break the fourth wall or die trying. 


He screams as he hits the wall at what to the audience might as well have been the speed of light. 
As the dust from the track settles, the audience gasp in disbelief and horror.
All that remains of the sprinter is a puddle of red and grey goo running down an invisible wall with a very visible crack through the middle.


The same doctor who saved the patient twice before is there in the hospital when the sprinter's reconstructed brain is somehow revived in a robot body.


""Well,"" he says to the doctor, ""I suppose this is a running joke."".

He had finally been granted the R&amp;R and was on a train bound London. The train was very crowded, so the solider walked the length of the train looking for an empty seat. 

The only unoccupied seat was adjacent to a well dressed middle age woman and was being used by her little dog.

The solider asked, ""Please, ma'am, May I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked at him, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little Fifi is using that seat?""

The solider walked away, determined to find a place to rest. After another trip down the train, he found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, ""Please, Lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans. Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!"" 

The solider didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty space. 

The woman shrieked, demanded that someone defend her and chastise the solider.

Suddenly, an English Gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, Sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.""

post,6rvz3w,2qh72,jokes,false,1501987087,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6rvz3w/child_development_and_politics/,self.jokes,,"All babies start out with the same number of raw cells which, over nine months, develop into a complete female baby. The problem occurs when cells are instructed by the little chromosomes to make a male baby instead.  Because there are only so many cells to go around, the cells necessary to develop a male's reproductive organs have to come from cells already assigned elsewhere in the fetus..

Recent tests have shown that these cells are removed from the communications center of the brain, migrate lower in the body and develop into male sexual organs. If you visualize a normal brain to be similar to a full deck of cards, this means that males are born a few cards short, so to speak.  And some of their cards are in their shorts.

This difference between the male and female brain manifests itself in various ways. Little girls will tend to play things like house or learn to read.

Little boys, however, will tend to do things like placing a bucket over their heads and running into walls. Little girls will think about doing things before taking any action. Little boys will just punch or kick something and will look surprised if someone asks them why they just punched their little brother who was half asleep and looking the other way.

This basic cognitive difference continues to grow until puberty, when the hormones kick into action and the trouble really begins. After puberty, not only the size of the male and female brains differ, but the center of thought also differs. Women think with their heads. Male thoughts often originate lower in their bodies where their ex-brain cells reside.

Of course, the size of this problem varies from man to man. In some men only a small number of brain cells migrate and they are left with nearly full mental capacity but they tend to be rather dull, sexually speaking. Such men are known in medical terms as ""Liberals."" Other men suffer larger brain cell relocation. These men are medically referred to as ""Conservatives.""

A small number of men suffer massive brain cell migration to their groins. These men are usually referred to as ""Mr. President.""

Now on the purple land was a purple continent and in this purple continent was a purple country and in this purple country there was lots of purple houses with lots of purple people inside getting on with their purple lives and doing purple things. On one purple hilltop, in this purple country full of purple people, in this purple continent, on the purple land, on this purple planet with purple lands and purple seas, in this purple universe was the purple kingdom of Purpalon. In this purple kingdom, past the purple gates, up the purple path, into the purple castle and through the purple doors guarded by purple guards, sat a purple king, who was purply named Purple Purple the fifth, and his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.

The purple king said to his purple son, the purple prince, “My purple son, in another purple kingdom a short purple distance away, there lives another purple King. This purple king has a purple princess who you are to marry. Her name is the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.” The purple prince after listening to his purple father, the purple king, agreed to marry the purple princess of Purpolina in a purple ceremony.

And so, on a fine purple day in the purple gardens inside the purple kingdom of Purpalon, prince Purple Purple the sixth and all the purple guests to this purple ceremony, watched the purple bride-to-be, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia walk down the purple aisle wearing a purple wedding dress and carrying a purple bouquet of purple flowers. However, just as the purple princess reached the purple alter at which the purple prince and the purple priest were standing waiting, an evil purple magician appeared in a purple puff of smoke and cast a purple spell on the purple princess. In a purple moment, the purple princess, Purplina Purple of Purplonia vanished.

""What have you done?"" cried the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.

""I have sent the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia to a purple cave in the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in her purple cave, she is guarded by the purple dragon Purplefang. The purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia is purply safe there, but the purple dragon Purplefang, will not let her rejoin the purple kingdoms of Purpalon and Purplonia.""

""You are purply insane,"" the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth said to the Purple magician, but the purple magician had vanished.

""What are you going to do, my purple son?"" the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon asked his son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.

""I am going to take my purple horse, Purple Lightning, and my purple sword, Purple Death, and go slay the purple dragon Purplefang and rescue the fair purple maiden the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.""

""May the purple God speed you well on your purple journey,"" the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon purply blessed his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth. With that, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth got his purple sword, Purple Death, and his purple horse, Purple Lightning, and rode off to the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.

The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, rode his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Eventually, the purple horse Purple Lightning got tired, so the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth carried his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Finally, the Purple prince Purple Purple the sixth reached the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in a purple cave on top of the purple mountain, Prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon could see the purple smoke from the purple dragon Purplefang who lived in the purple cave in which the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia was a purple prisoner. Our purple hero, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, climbed the purple mountain Mount Purpletop and slew the purple dragon Purplefang as the purple beast slept purply. The purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon rescued the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. But their purple adventures were not yet come to their purple close. They still had to get home purple and sound.

So...

The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, and the newly rescued purple heroine, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, rode the purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the same purple mountain of Mount Purpletop which in the purple cave thereon the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth slew the purple dragon Purplefang and rescued the purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Eventually, the purple horse Purple Lightning got tired, so the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth carried his purple horse Purple Lightning and the newly rescued purple heroine, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the same purple mountain of Mount Purpletop which in the purple cave thereon the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth slew the purple dragon Purplefang and rescued the purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Eventually, The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, got tired, so the newly rescued purple heroine, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, carried the purple horse Purple Lightning and the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields.

Purple alases and purple alaks, though, for it seems our purple heroes, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon and the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia got lost on their way home, for they wandered into the purple kingdom of an evil purple king, the evil purple king Purple Purponovov of Purplovia. This evil purple man had the purple heroes, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon and the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, arrested and locked up in purple handcuffs. He sent for some of his loyal purple guards of this evil purple kingdom of Purplovia and told them to take the purple prince and purple princess to the purple dungeons. So the purple guards took the purple prisoners through the purple halls of the purple castle in this evil purple kingdom and down the purple steps leading to the purple dungeon underneath the purple castle. The purple guards lead the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth and the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia along the purple corridor in the purple dungeon to the purple cell right at the end of the purple passageway. When they arrived at this purple cell, the purple guards opened the purple door to the purple cell in the purple dungeon. Just as the purple guards were throwing the purple prince and purple princess into the purple cell, they said…

During his routine, the magician pulls a quarter out of a kids ear. The bird flaps around his cage and says ""It was in his hand""

Agitated, but not discouraged, the magician continues. He makes flowers appear from nowhere. Again, the parrot announces ""Wire up the sleeve!"" 

The magician stops and says ""Listen here, bird, if you don't stay quiet I'm going to shoot you"" the parrot sits quietly

Then towards the end of his act the magician makes his hat disappear. The parrot squawks loudly ""It's in his back pocket!"" Now furious, the magician pulls a gun out and fires once at the parrot. He misses and it ricochets all the way down to the engine room and blows up the ship. The only survivors are the parrot and the magician. 

Three days pass and they say nothing to each other. On the fourth day the parrot looks at the magician and says ""Ok, I give up. Where's the ship?""",A magician joke,515

""Hey, man, you got any chapstick?"" asks the man to his buddy

""Nope, sure don't, why don't you ask the bartender"" says his buddy

The man asks the bartender but sadly the bartender has none. The bartender can clearly see how much agony the man is in so he asks aloud to every patron in the establishment whether anyone has any chapstick. 

No one answers.

After a couple minutes a lone cowboy comes up to him and tells him that he has something even better than chapstick and that he'd be happy to provide it to him if he follows him outside.

The man and the cowboy walk outside to where the cowboy has his horse tied up. 

""Ok, so all you have to is walk behind my horse, pull up his tail and plant your mouth firmly on it's ass"" says the cowboy. 

The man reasonably hesitates but the cowboy assures him, ""I promise you it will work!""

Willing to try anything at this point the man walks behind the horse, pulls up the tail and plants his lips smack onto the horse's ass. 

He walks back to the cowboy and says, angrily, ""I don't feel anything, and all I smell is horse shit, this isn't working at all!""

""Sure it is!"" exclaims the cowboy, ""it's keeping you from licking them!""

Attendance is low so the ushers starts handing out $20 cash to anybody who will come in and take a seat. Short on weed money 3 17 year old skateboarders come in.

They sit near the back and without knowing it Shia Labeouf is in a disguise sitting in the row in front of them like the weird self-obsessed dude that he is.

As the film starts playing:
Friend 1 'who the fuck is Shia Labeouf?'
Friend 2 'some autistic kid who posts videos of himself online'
Friend 3 'nah, he some autistic kid who got into a fight with reddit'
Overhearing this Shia grinds his teeth, fidgets in his chair and tries to ignore them

Friend 1 'it looks like he's some Autustic kid eating spams, I don't get it man'
Friend 2 'Shia Labeouf autistic walking around guy' he says, playing off the gag

Shia's knuckles whiten and his blood pressure rises. Who are these asshole kids? Don't they know he's famous?! 

Friend 3 'he's like Elijah Wood's autistic little brother'

At this point the friends are still clueless at the font of Shia-rage boiling in the row in front of them-- when all of a sudden Shia jumps up, tears off his wig 

!SHIA SURPRISE! 

And he lays into them, screaming every profanity he learned in jail on his multiple DUI cases, just motherf- this and son-of-a-fat-c%#€ that.

Building up his head of steam he screams:
""You dumb assholes just don't get it, it's experimental film, * I'm a performance Autist!*""

They knock on the door and the farmer warmly greets them.  They explain the situation and he says that he doesn't have he necessary equipment to tow them, but if they would like to stay, he has spare room for only two of them in the house.  One would have to sleep in the barn.

Since they really have no option, the three men argue for a bit over who would be the one to sleep in the barn.  The Jewish man volunteers to sleep in the barn and they all go to their respective beds.

About an hour later, there is a knock on the door.  The farmer opens the door and finds the Jewish man who says ""Forgive me for this.  I didn't realize that there was a pig in the barn.  I simply cannot stay there tonight.""  The farmer, understanding of this issue, says that it's fine, but there is still only room for two people in the house.  So they all are awake and they argue again over who will sleep in the barn.  This time the Hindu man says he will sleep in the barn.  They all go to bed again.

Another hour passes and then comes another knock on the door.  The farmer, slightly annoyed this time, opens the door to find the Hindu man, who apologetically says, ""I didn't realize there was a cow in the barn.  I cannot sleep there.""  Again, everybody is awake and there is not even an argument this time.  The aggravated lawyer says, ""Fine!  Since you two are so picky, I guess I'll just sleep in the barn!""  And they all go to bed again.

""You are a disrespectful pig!"" she cried. ""How dare you do this to me - a faithful wife, the mother of your children? I'm leaving you. I want a divorce!""

The husband replied "" Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.""

""Fine go ahead, she sobbed, but they'll be the last words you ever say to me!""

And so the husband began:

""Well, I was getting into the car to drive home and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car. I noticed that she was thin, poorly dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days!

So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night - the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!

Since she needed a good clean up I suggested she'd take a shower. While she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away.

Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years but don't use because you say they are too tight. I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't use because I don't have good taste. I went and found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas, the one you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at that expensive shoe boutique and don't use because someone at work has the same pair.""

The husband took a deep breath and continued:

""She was so grateful for my understanding and help. As I walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said:
'Please, do you have anything else that your wife don't use?'

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too similar to being another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, when he gave up and asked the old man behind the counter.  

He explained his situation to the old man. 

Old man : Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks for than a real penis can, except....

Rich man : Except what?

Old man : Nothing, nothing.

Rich man : C'mon, tell me!! I need something!!

Old man : Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick'.

Rich man : So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" the businessman asked. 

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. 

Rich man : Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!!

Old man : But you haven't seen what it'll do yet!!

He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, ""I'll take it!"" The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, it's a family heirloom, but at the end he finally surrendered to $2000 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone. 

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off!! 

So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. 

On the way there, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. 

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""",There was a rich man ready to go on a long business trip,17

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?"". Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you, she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey."" She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it."" Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman."" And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

The woman proceeds:

The father never had this situation so he walks out of the confessional box to ask the altar boys:

other one as Sister Logical (SL). 

It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent. 

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past 38 1⁄2
minutes? I wonder what he wants. 

SL: It's logical. He wants to violate us. 

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most! What
can we do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster. 

A little while later... 

SM: It's not working. 

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing. He
started to walk faster, too. 

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in 1 minute. 

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll
go this way. He cannot follow us both. 

So the man decided to follow Sister Logical. 

Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has
happened to Sister Logical. 

Then Sister Logical arrives. 

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened! 

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so
he followed me. 

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could
and he started to run as fast as he could. 

SM: And? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me. 

SM: Oh, dear! What did you do? 

SL : I lifted my dress up 

SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do? 

SL: He pulled down his pants. 

SM: Oh, no! What happened then? 

SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than
a man with his pants down. 

And for those of you who thought it would be dirty......
