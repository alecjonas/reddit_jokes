After a long pause, she answers, “well-done.”

“But that’s not the marrow of the issue, bone-head. I don't want your meat or your beef-cake body today” says Bella.

Of course, the woman wanted ""The Knob.""

Over the course of the years, the woman tightened the knob, and the effects were wonderful -- the woman remained young looking and vibrant.   After fifteen years, the woman returned to the surgeon with two problems. 

""All these years, everything has been working just fine. I've had to turn the knob many times and I've always loved the results. But now I've developed two annoying problems:

First, I have these terrible bags under my eyes and the knob won't get rid of them.""

His wife, who was watching TV, barely has time to look up before she gets ravished by the crazy horny bastard. Unconscious and drooling, the wife slides off the couch to the floor, while the husband, still not satisfied, jumps the housekeeper and does her in too.

Finally sensing he's really out of control, the man runs to the fridge to get some ice cold water, but all he can find is a bowl of cold milk. He sinks his dick in the bowl and sighs with relief.

He won’t even look at the cows. The farmer feels cheated, so he brings in the local vet to check out the bull. The bull is very healthy, the vet explains, but possibly just a little young. So he gives the farmer pills to feed the bull once per day. It will help with his urge to mate. After a few days, the bull starts to service a few cows, and within a week, every cow on the farm. The bull even breaks through the fence and breeds with all of the neighbor’s cows. He turns into a mating machine. A friend of the farmer asks exactly what the vet gave the bull to cause such a drastic change.

“I don’t know exactly what was in those pills,” the farmer says. 

“All I can tell you is they work and they taste like peppermint.”

The black piece of tarmac is huge in stature, built like a brick shithouse.. only tarmac.

It's a new bar and as he throws the door open the room falls silent and the ten foot tall monolith catches commands the attention of everyone in the bar.

He marched toward the bar and grunts 'your strongest draft, now, and your cheapest whiskey chaser' 

Eager to assert dominance, he necks four pints and chasers alike, 

Halfway through his fifth pint, the room once again falls silent, all eyes turn to the door of the bar, and in the haze of the cigarette smoke and the stale stench of piss and beer stands a short piece of pink tarmac.

The pink piece of tarmac stands about 3ft tall, skinny and looks worn down. 

The pink piece of tarmac storms towards the black piece of tarmac and bellows 'YOU'RE IN MY FACKIN SPOT NOW I SUGGEST YOU FACK OFF BEFORE I LAY YOU OUT' 

The black piece of tarmac, visibly shits himself, lowers his pint from his lips, and stutters 'alright m-mate s-sorry I didn't realise, here you go, I'll leave you be'

The black piece of tarmac heads to a booth in a  empty corner of the bar, and drowns his sorrows with more bitter.

The pink piece of tarmac sits smug upon his stool occasionally looking down on the black piece of tarmac in his corner of shame.

At the end of the night barman collects the empty glasses from the corner of the room and asks 'you alright mate?' to which the black piece of tarmac replies ""not really mate, I didn't mean to cause any trouble, I've had a shit day and I just wanted a pint or two""

The barman reassures him and says...

people come in to drink, and when they are ready to head out, they feel obligated to finish the drink they paid for. This little bit is enough to push many patrons past their limit and the bar owner wants to do something to encourage responsible drinking. 

The owner decides that she is going to introduce an exchange system. She decides that any patron of her bar will be able to leave an unfinished drink at a designated spot on the counter, and if they can currently spare it, they will give the customer a free small food item in place of the unfinished drink. 

They test out the system at the bar, and overall it's a resounding success! The one issue that is brought up is that people want to be able to choose their food items rather than having the bar choose for them. The bar owner decides to address this by giving her bartenders authority over deciding if someone can request a certain item or not, and that it can depend on how much is left in their drink so that the system does not get taken advantage of. 

Around that time, a group of friends is visiting the bar. They are having a great time, drinking, laughing, and even doing a little bit of singing. 

The time comes for the group to head out, and one of the members has a bit of whiskey left in his glass. He knows that if he finishes that last bit, he's going to regret it in the morning. He gets ready to just leave it on the table and head out when one of his friends stops him and tells him about the exchange system.

The bar is known to have the most amazing fried onion around. Though small, it's perfectly dark golden brown with a glistening thick texture that breaks perfectly into your mouth with a satisfying crispness on each bite. 

The man decides he is going to request that fried onion in exchange for what is left in his glass. It's not a lot of whiskey, but it's at least a few sips worth. 

The group watches as he walks up to the bar and leaves his glass at the designated spot on the counter for exchanges. They watch as the bartender on duty walks over and begins a conversation. They can immediately tell by the body language it's not going as planned. The conversation ends as the man tries to find out just how much whiskey he would have needed to be able to obtain that amazing fried onion. 

He returns to his group empty-handed to inform them of the result. 

""Well,"" he says to his friends with a sigh,

""It was worth a shot."" ",A bar is testing out an innovative new exchange system.,13

Three men are walking through the desert.  As they're traveling along, a giant hole randomly appears and swallows them up.

They fall for what seems like ages.  And abruptly land completely unharmed.  They look around and find they're in hell.  And the devil sits before them smiling.

Devil: Fear not.  You all appear to know where you are and who I am.  However...  I offer you a chance to leave this place unharmed.  Name anything that you believe I can't do, and if you are correct, you are free to go.  However...  If you are wrong...  I WILL EAT YOU!

The three men are terrified.  Two of the men start talking about what they could challenge the Devil with, while the third, relaxes himself.  Sits on a stone.  And begins to ponder.

One of the two that were discussing ideas seems to be sure of himself.  Straightens with courage and looks Satan square in the eye.

""Alright Devil...  How about you stop a speeding train right in it's tracks.""

Devil: Very well.

The Devil does it.  Picks up the man and swallows him whole.

The other guy who was talking about ideas is stunned.  But he too straightens up and pitches his best idea.

""Alright Devil.  I see you can stop a speeding train.  But how about you pick up the Eiffel Tower!""

Devil:. Consider it done.

Devil does it.  Grabs the second man and swallows him whole.

The third man has been watching this all transpire.  Still, he sits in his stone calmly.

After some time the Devil loses his patience.

Devil: The time is now.  State your challenge or i will eat you anyway.

The last man holds his finger up... 

Scrunches up his face...

And let's loose the most horrendous fart ever seen, heard, or smelled.

When it was getting dark he came across a secluded cabin in a clearing on top of a hill. He knocked on the door, and an ancient looking Chinese man answered the door.
“Please sir”, the man plead. “It is getting dark, and I’m lost. Could you put me up for the night?”
“Of course”, said the old man with a slight bow. “Come on inside”. “BUT! On one condition. You will not lay a finger on my precious daughter. For if you do, I will inflict on you the three worst Chinese tortures know to man”.
Thinking about how old the man was, his daughter couldn’t be a spring chicken herself, so he accepted the old mans terms and was welcomed inside. When dinner was served, a young, beautiful woman walked down the stairs. ‘This was his daughter’, he thought. Oh boy, he was in trouble. Furthermore, her eyes were locked on him, flirting the entire night. After a long evening of her flirtatious wiles, he snuck into her room late at night, and they made quiet, passionate love. Afterwards, he sneaks back into the guest room in the attic and goes to sleep thinking he got away with it.
The next morning, he wakes up to a pressure on his chest, and sees a large rock on top of him with a note taped to it.
“Chinese torture #1”, the note said. “Large rock placed on chest”.
“Really?” He thought. “Was this the best the old man could do?”
He heaves the rock off of him, carried it to the window and tossed it out to roll down the hill. Once he does he notices a second note taped to the wall. “Chinese torture #2. Rock tied to left testicle”. In horror, he looks down to see a thin rope leading out his left pant leg. The rope was rapidly running out the window. In a split second decision, he jumped out the window. Rather he break a bone then being castrated. When he crashed through the window pane he saw a large note dug into the ground.

God shakes His head, patiently. “My child,” He says, “It is not evil to be mistaken. Which is to your benefit, because in this case, the mistake is yours.

He told Nikolay that he had a higher iq so he must be smarter. Nikolay just laughed and told him there was only one way to tell who was smarter. They must go to a canyon and cross it, the first person to do so will be crowned the biggest brain.

And so the two men traveled to Arizona, the home of the Great Canyon, where they would display their Great intelligence. Upon arrival, at the vast canyon that stretched out in front of them appeared uncrossable, all except for a very thin land bridge, a ledge jutting out across the canyon stopping a few feet from the other side.

David immediately began to cross the ledge, taking care not to plummet to his doom. Penai stared at his departure for a minute and then confidentially began to climb down the canyon wall.

As David reached the end of the ground beneath him, he realized that the gap he thought was a few feet wide actually spanned more than a couple meters. 

David, fearful but not one to admit defeat, leaped away from the safety of the stone ledge to the glory of the other side. 

As he soared through the open air David realized one key detail: he was not an Olympic long jumper. Reaching out with his left, David desperately tried to reach his goal yet, he was just too far away.

Suddenly, as David prayed to his god for a painless death, a strong hand came out and grabbed his wrist. Nikolay, who had crossed the canyon minutes before, pulled his friend up to safety. David was shocked, both at his survival and the appearance of Nik on the other side. David asked him, “Nik how did you know the ledge wasn’t the right idea, that it wasn’t the path to victory??”

Nik replied, “Because D, in my mind there is no ledge”.","Long ago there were two men, David and Nikolay the Wise",6

When he gets to prison, he meets his bunkmate, Big Joel. Now, contrary to what you may think, Big Joel was not a rapist. In fact, he was the nicest man Myto had ever met. Big Joel helped him through his day, showing him where to eat, shower, and work out. Myto woke up every morning and had a Chocolate Brownie for breakfast. The only brownies the prison sold were from a strange company called Dria. 

Every night, however, Myto noticed something. The power always went out at exactly 9 PM. Being an electrical engineer, Myto decided to find out why this was the case. He asked his bunkmate, Big Joel why this happened. Big Joel shook his head and sighed. “Don’t know why it’s got to be this way. It just do. Power goes out every night at 9.” Myto was perplexed. He resolved to fix this issue using all his electrical engineering prowess. He realized that by using the strange brownies made by Dria, he could make a con brownie. He hid a very powerful battery that he stole from the guards and hooked it up to the wires of his cell. To his delight, the cell lit up!

Of course, this didn’t sit well with the other prisoners. Why was Myto and Big Joel’s cell lighting up even after nine PM? One of the prisoners came up to Big Joel and asked him how the hell their cell was still lighting up. Big Joel promptly replied:

Well, everyone knows Myto’s con Dria is the powerhouse of the cell

He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

The 3 men are persistent in their search for some help and hike day and night until until they come across a small cabin in the woods. They see smoke drifting from chimney and what looks like a candle burning in the window. Hopeful that they have found someone who can help, they approach the door and give a nice knock knock knock. 

A burly old farmer opens the door, ""Well now, I wasn't expecting any company this evening, how can I help you boys?""

The first man responds, ""Sir we've been lost in the woods for almost 3 days with no food and no water. Is there anything you can do to help us out?""

The farmer invites the boys in and has them sit at the table. He says, ""I tell you what, I'll get you some of the best food you've ever had and plenty of beer, but I need you to do one thing for me. My daughter's upstairs and it's been quite a while since she's been pleasured by a man. If one of you is able to satisfy her then the food and beer is all yours.""

Although all three men were starving and fatigued, there could be much worse ways to earn a meal and a nice beer. So the first guy says to the farmer, ""Sir, I'd be happy to take care of your daughters problem"" and runs up the stairs.
About a minute later he comes screaming back down the stairs and bursts out of the front door. 

The second man thinks to himself, ""It can't be that bad"" and heads up the stairs to give it a shot. 
Again, just moments later he comes screaming down the stairs and flies out the front door.

The third man, who's now grown even more hungry and thirsty thinking of the delicious food waiting and the cold beer, decides to see for himself what's going on with this farmers daughter and makes his way up stairs.

When he opens the door he see the daughter laying on the bed. The rooms kinda dark and he moves in a little closer. As soon as he opens her legs he sees what he had only imagined in nightmares. There's cobwebs, boils and puss, hair everywhere, and a smell he could only liken to dead fish and cheese. As he turns his head in disgust, holding back his vomit, he notices 2 corncobs on the nightstand and gets an idea. He takes off his sock and says, ""I'm going to blind fold you baby to make it more exciting"". Once she was blindfolded he grabs a corncob and slides it in. The farmers daughter gave a slight moan and said, ""Wow you're really big honey, you can go faster!"".

The 3rd man begins to really give it to her with the corncob and then chucks it out the window. He grabs the second corncob and continues until the farmers daughter has the best orgasm of her life and he chucks the second corncob out the window. Then he removed the blindfold and stood there proud of his job well done. Extremely pleased the daughter grabs the man's hand and leads him back down the stairs. By the huge smile on her face the farmer new the man got the job done and proceeded to pour him the biggest beer of his life. 

After he takes a couple big gulps he decides to head out front to tell his friends the good news. ""Guys I took care of it, come inside and get some cold beer while the food is cooking!"" 

The two men look up with big ole grins on their faces and say, ""Aw man while you've been in there dealing with that nasty woman, we've been out here enjoying this delicious creamed corn we found just laying on the ground!""",3 guys are lost in the woods,13

'The Knob,' where a small knob is placed at the top of the woman's head and could 

be turned to tighten up her skin and produce the effect of a brand new face-lift. Of course, 

the woman wanted 'The Knob.'  


Over the course of the years, the woman tightened the knob, and the effects were wonderful,

the woman remained young looking and vibrant.

After fifteen years, the woman returned to the surgeon with two problems.  
 

'All these years, everything has been working just fine. I've had to turn the knob many times 

and I've always loved the results. But now I've developed two annoying problems: 

First, I have these terrible bags under my eyes and the knob won't get rid of them.'  
 The doctor looked at her closely and said, 'Those aren't bags, those are your breasts.'  
 She said, 'Well, I guess there's no point in asking about the goatee.' ",The Knob,8

The planet overlords tirelessly watch every being on Bogaboon and, based on their life performance, will grant only those they deem worthy with the Universe Pass, giving them access to the whole universe of Galanthia. 

The issue for the beings of Bogaboon is that they have no idea what criteria the overlords are looking for and so must try whatever they can in order to qualify for the Universe Pass that they all so crave.

Some work tirelessly to produce what resources the planet needs, some read to learn everything they can in order to gain vast knowledge, some perform, some create.

Once those few that are deemed worthy are granted the U.P. each holder must then enter the chamber of the overlords where exists the only exit from the planet. Here they must put there trust in the overlords one final time as they let them down the tunnel of destiny and out into the universe.

Rick, a middle aged Bogaboonion, has dedicated his life to the art of music and song in his attempts to impress the overloads, but after years of trying it all seems to be getting him nowhere. He is having a mid-life crisis and feels he is destined to never leave Bogaboon like so many others before him.

So Rick decides he will confront one of the overlords to try and discover his current position and see if there is anything he can do to acheive the seemingly unacheivable U.P.

Upon hearing Rick's pleas one of the nicer of the overlords decides to check the Bogaboon database and see what information they hold on Rick. 

It's not good news, the overlords have hated Rick's music and singing since he was a child and he now has such a low rating that it would be practically impossible for him to change anything and acheive his life goal.

The overlord therefore decides to tell him straight, ""I'm sorry Rick but...

I'm never gonna give you U.P., never gonna let you down.",On the planet of Bogaboon in the universe of Galanthia,4

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as ""Somebody"". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he had spent eight years working at his quite establishment, collecting weather patterns for the news, but had never received such an ominous task. Steve decided immediately, that he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a news van, so if it was real he'd be able to leave as soon as possible. Next he pulled out his laptop, needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

""Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?""

""Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!""

""Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?""

""Hello sir, how may we help you?""  
""I want to apply for political asylum, and I would like to emigrate immediately""  
""I see... but may I ask what is the reason?""  
""It's a very long story, your Excelency""  
""Well, I have all the time. Moreover, I am really interested to see what your reason is. We do not get many asylum seekers from Finland""  
""Well, your Excellency, it's like this. As you see, I am rather old, and I got to see a lot of things during my lifetime. I was born in the 1930's and during those times, if a person was suspected of being gay, he was hunted and killed on the spot.""  
""Uhm.. yeah... I presume."", says the Ambassador  
""Then, after the WWII was over, in the 50s when we were under the Soviet influence, gay people were being incarcerated.""  
""Mhm..""  
""And then after the sexual emancipation, during the 70s, they would not send gays to prison anymore, but they would loose all their friends and no family members would speak to them anymore""  
""I presume so...""  
""Then - continues the old guy - in the 90's it was widely accepted that gays have equal rights and it wasn't anymore frowned upon.""  
""Mmm, yes..?"", said the increasingly confused Ambassador.  
""And now, a few years back, gay marriage was legalized in Finland""  
""Yes, I remember that. I was under active duty here in Helsinki. But forgive me, what does this have to do with anything?!""  
""Well, you see... I want to emigrate before it becomes mandatory!""",An old finnish guy goes to the US embassy,0

His final request is that these three, the last man on earth he feels he can trust, each bring their allotment of his fortune to his funeral, ten million each, and deposit the money in his coffin and bare witness as it's sealed and lowered into the ground. 

On the day of the funeral, unsurprisingly, the pastor, doctor and lawyer are the only three on attendance. As they gather around the coffin the pastor speaks first. 

""I'm sorry, gentlemen. I could not fully honor our friends dying wish. His money can do nothing for him in the afterlife, but here on earth it can still do some good. So I confess that I've donated one million to several reputable charities I know are in need of funds and used another million to sponsor missionaries to spread the word of God. But look."" he opened a bag of cash he had with him.

""I still have the remaining eight million. I trust this will be enough to satisfy our friend and justify me before the Lord."" And he dumped the money into the coffin. 

The doctor spoke next. 

""I too have partially betrayed the trust of our friend. I feel a little guilty, but I can't condone burying all this money while so many people are suffering. I gave two million to my hospital to help them update and replace all our old, outdated equipment and I donated two million to Doctors Without Borders to help them save countless lives in the developing world.

""But I've brought the other six million."" With that he opened the bag he carried and dumped the cash into the coffin.

""Our greedy friend can still rest in peace and I can still live with myself.""

The lawyer glared at the other two with a stern expression. 

""How dare you? Both of you aught to be ashamed of yourselves! It's not a question of what this money could or could not be used for. It's a question of legal and moral responsibility. Our poor friend wasn't benevolent, or generous, or even very nice. That caused everyone he knew to abandon him. Everyone but we three. We were the only three in the world he trusted to honor his last request.""

At this he produced an envelope from his coat pocket. 

""That is why I will leave this check for the full ten million with our dearly departed friend.""","A greedy old miser dies alone. In his will he's divided his fortune between his pastor, his doctor, and his lawyer with one last request...",13

""""Yes, yes mummy. Move your hands"". So the mother removes her hands. Jonny blinks and opens his eyes. ""Mummy, mummy, I still can't see. Oh, mummy does God hate me? Mummy I can't see"".

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.
