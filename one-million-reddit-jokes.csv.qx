Two Hutterites, Jacob and John, purchase some budgies from a pet shop and drive over to a bridge. From the top of the bridge, John looks down at the 200-foot drop and says, 'Dis looks like a grand place.'
 
He takes the two birds, puts them on his shoulders and jumps off the bridge. Jacob watches as John falls all the way to the bottom. Looking down at the remains of his best pal, Jacob shakes his head and says, 'Dis is too dangerous fer me.'
 
Moments later Isaac arrives up on the bridge. He's been to the pet shop too and walks up to the edge of the bridge carrying a parrot on one hand and a shotgun in the other. 'Hey, Jacob, vatch dis,' Isaac says.
 
He takes a parrot from the bag and throws himself off the bridge. Jacob watches as halfway down, Isaac takes the gun and shoots the parrot. Isaac continues to plummet until he hits the bottom. Jacob shakes his head and says, 'Ya, und I'm never trying dat either.'
 
Jacob is just getting over the shock of losing two friends when Abe appears. He's carrying an old potato sack out of which he pulls a chicken. Abe then grasps the chicken by the legs, holds it over his head, hurls himself off the bridge and disappears down and down until he too hits bottom. Jacob shakes his head in sadness.

One year Buddy and Edna went to the fair, and Buddy said,
'Edna, I'm 85 years old. If I don't ride that helicopter, I might never get another chance'

To this, Edna replied,
""Buddy that helicopter ride is fifty bucks, and fifty bucks is fifty bucks'

The pilot overheard the couple and said,
'Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and don't say a word I won't charge you a penny! But if you say one word it's fifty dollars.'

Buddy and Edna agreed and up they went.
The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word...

When they landed, the pilot turned to Buddy and said,
'By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm impressed!'

Buddy replied,

After their mother left, Ben, Mary and Jenny sat down and watched some TV for a while, ate dinner and finally went to bed at around 9.

Ben was lying in bed naked about to fall asleep when he heard the door of his room open slowly. He sat up quickly and there was Jenny standing in the doorway. He shouted ""JENNY! What are you doing in here?"" Without making even a noise, Jenny hopped on the bed and started giving oral sex to Ben. Ben didn't know what to do and just allowed it to happen. After a few minutes he couldn't take it anymore, got himself propped up, and started having sex with Jenny. After it was over, Jenny left the room and Ben fell right asleep.

The next night, Ben and Mary went to bed at 9 again. Ben laid in bed for a while hoping Jenny would come back in. About an hour went by and she wasn't there yet, so he decided to go and see what she was up to.

After looking in most of the rooms in the house, he couldn't find Jenny anywhere. He walked back towards his room, and when he walked by Mary's room, he heard a loud moan. He opened Mary's door, and there was Jenny, furiously going to town between Marys legs.

""MARY!!! JENNY!!! WHAT IS GOING ON?"" He screamed. Mary then shot up and looked at Ben and said ""BEN, I NEED A DICK! COME MAKE LOVE TO ME"" ""BUT YOUR MY SISTER, I CANT DO THAT"" ""JUST DO IT BEN I NEED IT""

Ben and Mary had sex and then laid down on the bed afterwards. ""Wow that was great!"" Said Mary. ""It was, but we can NEVER tell Mom about this!"" Ben then said.

They're about to lie down and give up when all of a sudden one of them says, ""H..H...Hey...do you smell bacon?""

The other one says, ""Yeah...I do smell bacon. What is that?""

So the two gather their strength, drag themselves slowly over the next dune, and there in the distance, rippling in the heat, they see a tree covered in bacon. There's raw bacon, fried bacon, back bacon, double-smoked bacon...every imaginable kind.

The first guy hoarsely whispers, ""I think we're saved. It's a bacon tree!""

The other guy says, ""No...it must be a mirage. Who ever heard of a bacon tree? We're in the desert, after all.""

The first guy says, ""Yeah, but when has a mirage ever smelled like bacon? It must be a bacon tree!""

He steels himself and, wavering, slowly lifts himself from the ground until he's standing, unsteady but resolved. Slowly putting one foot in front of the other into the hot sand, he moves forward toward the tree. He makes slow, staggering progress. His friend crawls behind him, barely able to see.

After some time, getting closer, closer, closer, the first guy gets to within a few feet of the tree when suddenly a machine gun opens up and he drops to the ground, mortally wounded.

""Stay back! Stay back!"" he hoarsely yells to his friend. ""You're right! It's not a bacon tree?""

His friend shouts back, ""It's not a bacon tree? What is it?""

In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the better of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside.

In the box there were 3 empty beer cans and $1,874.25 in cash.
After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her guilt and she confessed, saying, ""I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked in the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box?""

Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess that after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.""

Hillary was shocked, but said, ""I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the number of years we've been together.""

They hugged and made their peace.
A little while later, Hillary asked Bill -
""So why do you have all that money in the box?""

Bill answered, ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans...
I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash!""",When Bill and Hillary first got married....,4

The son is so proud to help out his dad, but he's not allowed to work on site so he just hands his dad the bricks from the pile.  10 bricks down, one row up.  ten more bricks, another row up.  Eventually his father, sweaty and tired leans back and looks at a finished chimney.  The son asks, ""Dad we have one brick left.""  His fathers not sure why, but tired and just tells him to throw it up in the air!...

...Alright, so apparently some people don't think thats a very good joke.  Let's try another:

A man is working in a corporate office in Silicon Valley, when his boss tells him ""I need you to go close a deal in New York.""
""Sure'ya boss man"" he says, but there's one issue:  he's deathly afraid of flying.  But he knows he needs to do this to climb the ladder and support his gorgeous wife and beautiful kids.  He gets the ticket, goes to the airport, and while waiting to board sees a plane land and almost leaves.  ""No"", he thought to himself, ""I need to do this for family.""  Bracing himself, he boards the plane and gets settled. 

 It takes off smoothly, everythings going fine until tragically the plane had a disastrous failure and crashed somewhere over the midwest.  No one survived.  When the police arrived to perform the investigation as to why the plane crashed, they find a brick in the engine.",[long] A son goes to work with his dad,0

She then tells the blonde that she paid for economy class, and that she will have to sit in the back.

The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the pilot and the co-pilot that there is a blonde bimbo sitting in first class, that belongs in economy, and won’t move back to her seat.

The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for economy she will have to leave and return to her seat.

The blonde replies, “I’m blonde, I’m beautiful, I’m going to Sydney and I’m staying right here”.

The co-pilot tells the pilot that he probably should have the police waiting when they land to arrest this blonde woman who won’t listen to reason.

The pilot says, “You say she is a blonde? I’ll handle this, I’m married to a blonde. I speak blonde”.

He goes back to the blonde and whispers in her ear, and she says, “Oh, I’m sorry” and gets up and goes back to her seat in economy.

The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss.

I told her, “First class isn’t going to Sydney “




Edit: Thanks for the gold. Thanks for the comments. Thanks for the abuse - whilst highlighting that it is an unoriginal joke.

And poof! They’re back in the land of the living, strolling down main street. The trio looks for a place to hunker down for the next 24 hours, when the Irishman spots a pub.

“To hell with it! Saint Pete probably can’t keep an eye on all of us.”

And as he starts to walk towards the bar, poof! he disappears.

Alarmed and distraught, the Jew and the Priest quickly flee the scene, looking for a place to settle down until the Jew spots a dime on the sidewalk. He instinctively bends down to pick it up and poof!

Both of them disappear.

-''This is my coop, friend.'' he tells him. ''Every chicken here is mine and you don't get to touch them.''   
-''Nah old thing, I'm the new boss here, look at you, you're old and tired!''

-''But wait,'' the old rooster continues, ''As I am older I get to have a head start, like one or two feet.''

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

The doctor asks what the matter seems to be.

The man responds: ""Well, my throat's been hurting real bad for the last few weeks. I've been to at least ten other local surgeries and clinics, where I've been told each time that there's nothing wrong with me. But, I swear my throat's still in agony.""

""Hmm."" The doctor goes, ""you don't look too bad, there's no visible swelling, your voice seems normal."" while prodding the man's neck with his fingers.

He asks the man to lift up his head, move his head into different positions, and to open his mouth, and to make different noises. He looks down the mans mouth in different lights, he checks his sinuses.
He does all this for about 10 minutes. 

Then says ""there seems to be nothing of concern.""

""Please, doctor,"" says the man ""I have been to so many places, and they've all said the same thing. Is there nothing else you can do?""

The doctor pauses, apparently deep in thought, until he says ""OK"" and walks over to the wall furthers from the door, bends down and knocks on a now apparent little hatch in skirting board.

He stands up straight, then goes to take a seat.

The patient is fixated on the hatch, which is being opened from the inside to reveal a somewhat large, brown, male cat.

Astounded, the man flicks his eyes up at the doctor, then back at the cat.

The cat starts to walk around him, sniffing. He does this maybe 5 times. Then, he claws his way up the man's shirt, to pitch on the mans shoulder. He gives the man a single lick on his neck, before hopping down. The cat goes over to his hole in the wall, turns to face the doctor, gives two, quick, high pitched mews, then disappears.

The doctor closes the door behind him. ""Well. What more d'you want?""

""Something else, of course. That was ridiculous! I demand you do something else! Of value, perhaps this time?""

""So be it."" Uttered the doctor.

He walks over to another hatch, much larger, and knocks on the door.

The man watches as a fairly large, dark dog enters the room.

The dog circles the man about 15 times, places his two front paws on the man's lap, then walks back to his hatch, he gives a signal to the doctor with one loud, definite bark. Then leaves.

""As you can see, there's clearly nothing wrong w-""

The doctor is cut short as he sees the man storming off, muttering curses under his breath.

The doctor says to him, in a loud voice, but very calmly ""That'll be $5,000.""

""WHAT?!?"" Exclaimed the man, infuriated. ""Is this some kinda joke?!? $5,000 to be sniffed at by some pets!!""

""Sir, we've just performed a cat scan and a lab test. $5,000 is a bargain!""",The sore throat,58

They had tried to communicate during their flight into the atmosphere, but no answer had come. Bork turned to the pilot with a mocking smile.

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

There is no one else in the bar besides the bartender and this guy. Things are slow so the bartender says to the guy ""Hey you want to see something cool?"" The guy says sure. So they both hop into the bartenders car and start driving. They drive for 30 min before they drive up to a gate. The bartender gets out and opens the gate, gets back in and drives through, and then gets out and closes the gate. Now they are at a river. They ditch the car and get into a little paddle boat and paddle across the river. At the end is a gate. The bartender walks up opens the gate, they walk through and then he closes the gate. Now they are at a 2nd river, which is twice as large as the first river. The paddle boat across. Get to another gate and the bartender opens it, they go through, and then he closes it. Now they are at a mountain. They promptly hike over the mountain quick and come up to a gate. Bartender opens, they go through, he closes. Now they are at a 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. They hike over this one now as well. Then they come up to another gate. The bartender opens said gate, they walk through, he closes said gate. Finally, they have arrived at a cave. The bartender cups his hands around his mouth and yells ""Here little green man, little green man!"" All of a sudden this tiny little green man comes bee-bopping up. The guy is amazed at this phenomenon and decides he wants to touch the little green man. Just as he is reaching out the bartender pulls him back exclaiming ""You must never touch this little green man!"" The man obliges and they leave the cave. So they come up to a gate, the bartender opens it, they go through, he closes it. They hike over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Come up to a gate, opens, walks through, closes. They hike over the first mountain. Come to the gate, open it, walk through, close it. Now they paddle boat across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Come to the gate. Open, walks through, closes. They paddle boat across the first river. Open gate, walk through, close gate. Drive back to the bar. So now the guy is sitting there just thinking over and over wow I could really make some money off of this little green man. So he gets in his own car this time and drives himself to the first gate.

He reaches down to pick the little green man up and as soon as he touches him the little green man starts going berserk! The man is startled and takes off running away from the little green man. He runs to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and starts just sprinting over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it.

He runs up to the front desk and says ""give me a ticket to the furthest place possible!"" The lady at the front desk says well that would be New Zealand. So she gives him a ticket and he boards and the plane takes off. All the time the man is in the plane he can see a tiny tiny green dot on the ground. After 16 hours the plane finally lands and the man steps off. At this point the little green man comes limping up to him. He is tired, hurt, and exhausted. The man thinks OK I'm out of options I should finally give this little green man a chance to explain himself.

Everyone loved Juan. He was so sweet and compassionate with the kids and did a wonderful job. One day the principal came up to Juan and said:
""You know Juan, you care about this school so much, maybe you should run for the board of education""
And Juan said:
""You know, I've never thought about that before, but why not?""
So Juan got up in front of the people in town and gave a speech:
""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog""
Now politicians tend to be dishonest, but the people of this town knew Juan, and his statements hit home with them. Juan was elected by a landslide.
Juan worked tirelessy to clean up the schools, day and night, instituting new programs and fixing the curriculum. In a very short time graduation rates doubled and test scores shot up.
Then one day the governer died of a heart attack, and the people who Juan worked with closely on the board suggested Juan run.
Juan said:
""Well I've never thought about that before, but why not?""
Juan gave a speech to his state:
""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids and I love my dog""
The state went wild for such an honest and loveable man and he was elected.
As governer he made his home state a wonderful place to live, businesses boomed, communities were peaceful, crime was down and employment was up. Everyone loved Juan.
Then one day Juan was approached by a political group that endorses candidates for major offices. They asked Juan if he would like to run for president.
Juan said:
""Hmm, I've never thought about tbat before, but why not?""
Juan stood before the American people and said:
""My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog.""
The crowd goes ballistic, the American people lose their god damn minds. No candidate had ever been so universally loved like Juan.
Juan is elected President of the United States.
A few years go by. Juan keeps every one of his campaign promises. Unemployment is down to basically nothing, the economy is booming, the national debt is on its way to being paid off.
Then reality hits Juan.
He has no where to go from here.
Juan becomes depressed. He starts drinking heavily.
One day he is sitting in the Oval office drunk as a skunk when his wife comes in. She wants funding for a new project. Juan doesn't listen. He pulls out a gun and shoots her. Then Juan's children come into the oval office wanting the time and attention of their father. He shoots them a well. Lastly his dog comes trotting in looking for a walk or a treat but he shoots the dog as well.
This doesn't sit well with the American people. He is arrested and put up for impeachment but is able to make bail and get out for a while before the trial, but he's not allowed back in the white house and he doesn't have a home. 
The American people were so distraught and were searching for answers. ""How could we elect such a monster!"" Cried the media. ""What could have possibly made him do this!"" Every news organization brought in psychologists and experts, but noone could understand the complete turn around in character.  They all finally realized...It takes Juan to know Juan.",Juan the custodian (alternate ending),2

It's his senior year and he feels that he should go to prom. So he musters up the courage and asks one of his friends. She says yes. Now he has to prepare for the dance.
The next day, he goes to buy his tickets, and there is a huge line. So he waits, and waits, and waits, then he finally gets the tickets.
The next day, he goes with his date to go get a dress. When they get to the store, there is a huge line going out the door. So the wait, they wait, and they wait. Finally, they get to the front and buy a dress.
After this, they go to men's warehouse to get him a suit for the dance, and there is a huge line going out the door. So they wait, wait, and wait. Finally they get in and buy a nice suit.
The next day, he remembers that he needs to order a corsage. So he goes to the local store and there is a huge line. So he waits, waits, and waits until he gets his order in.
Now it's the day before prom and he wakes up and realizes that he forgot to order a limo, so he calls up the limo rental place. All the lines are busy so he decides to go into the place. When he gets there, he sees the line stretching out the door and around the corner. So he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally he was lucky enough to get the very last limo.
So now it's the night of the dance and when they get to the prom, the school is doing mandatory drug testing, so there is a huge line getting into the prom. So the wait, wait, and wait. Finally they get to the front and they both pass their drug tests.
Now the dance was going pretty good for about a half an hour, until he really, really had to go to the bathroom. So he takes off to go, and he sees this huge line going out of the bathroom. He waits, waits, and waits until he finally takes care of his business.
When he comes out of the bathroom, he notices that a crowd has formed around his date. She had just randomly passed out. Someone says to him, ""hey, you're her date, go get her some punch.""

“You are a disrespectful pig!” she cried. “How dare you do this to me! I’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I’m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!”


The husband replied, “Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.”


“Go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”


So the husband began, “Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.


I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!


Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.


I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”


The husband took a quick breath and continued, “She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…”

post,5d8g1f,2qh72,jokes,false,1479290457,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5d8g1f/chili_contest_in_texas/,self.jokes,,"A note from Frank: ""Recently, while visiting Texas (I'm from Springfield, IL) I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light beer booth, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that even though I was inexperienced as a Chili taster, the chili &gt;wouldn't be all that spicy. Besides, they told me, I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.""

Here are the scorecard notes from the event:

**CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.


**CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN'S AFTERBURNER CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.


**CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting {censored}-faced from all of the beer.


**CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC**

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?


**CHILI # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER**

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.


**CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY**

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers and garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, &gt;sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will &gt;eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.


**CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. Atleast during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.


**CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI**

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

Judge # 3 - No Report",Chili contest in Texas,3

One day the man was walking down an empty street when a young man jumped at him with a knife, stabbed him and took his money.

The man thought surely he would die as he lay on the ground bleeding. But then out of nowhere a monk appeared. The monk pocked him up and carried him away.

Soon after the man lost consciousness, but when he awoke he was in a small dark room filled with the smells of aromatic spices. The monk was kneeling in front of him reeding words from a small book around his neck. 

The man drifted in and out of consciousness for 3 days until he was healed. He thanked the monk for helping him and asked what was in the little book around his neck. The monk replied ""I cannot tell you for you are not a monk""

The man took the monks word and left, determined to live a more active and healthy life lest something simar happen to him. 

He decided to go on holiday. He went to a tropical country with beautiful sandy beaches and sapphire oceans. One day he was swimming in the crystal clear sea when a shark swam out of nowhere and attacked him, leaving him bleeding heavily and drowning.

He thought he was going to die, but then who should swim past? It was the monk. The monk carried him to safety and like last time set about healing him. Reading words from the lite book around his neck.

When the man was healed he thanked the monk and again asked what was inside that little book around his neck. And as before the monk replied ""I cannot tell you for you are not a monk"".

By now the man is old and so says to the monk ""I am old, my life is nearing the end, how may I become a monk?"" The monk tells him of the monastery atop a mountain and gives directions. The man thanks him and leaves.

The man sets about on his journey up the mountain. It is long and arduous, but he keeps going. But then on a particularly steep but of mountain he slips and falls. Not far enough to kill him, but he is gravely injured.

Once again he thinks he will die when who should stop but the monk. The monk carries him to safety and performs the rituals to him all the while reading from the little book.

When he is healed the man once again asks what is in the little book, to the same answer ""I cannot tell you for you are not a monk"". The man tells the monk he wants to become a monk and so the monk takes the man up to the monastery.

The man trains under the Abbott for a year to become a monk and one day he calls the man into his office. He tells him he is ready to receive his little book.

The man enters the room where the books are hidden and picks one up and reads its secrets. And I'm sure you would like to know what is in the book, but I cannot tell you for you are not a monk.",A JOURNEY FROM MAN TO MONK,8

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere, how can you say the best part of my body is my ears?""

However, the boy shocked the judge when he revealed that his aunt beat him more than his parents did, and refused to live with her. The judge then attempted to hand custody over to the boy's grandparents, but the boy claimed they beat him too. 

After closely examining the rest of the remaining family and learning that apparently domestic violence was a way of life for them, the judge conferred with his colleagues to determine who should have custody over the boy.

Just a minute, she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. Do these excite you? She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for Joe with his cotton eye, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""
""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.
""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.
At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to build a wall, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.
Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""
His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

No, no, this was an extremely intelligent wasp. He was so smart, in fact, that one day he decided to leave the nest to go to high school. Obviously, this was a big deal for his family, but they supported him in following his dreams, so they packed up his few belongings and sent him off the high school.

You might think that a wasp wouldn't do very well in a high school, and normally you'd be right. This wasp, however, was not only extremely smart, but also very good with people. He had a natural gift for speaking that made everyone adore him and hang on his every word. He was elected class president all four years and graduated as his class's valedictorian with a perfect 4.0 GPA.

This wasp was so smart, in fact, that he got a full scholarship to study at Harvard. He wanted to use his gifts to help lead people forward, so he left his hometown to go study politics. As I said before, this wasp was quite possibly the smartest wasp in history, and had no problems acing all of his classes. Four years later, he received his bachelor's degree and graduated at the top of his class.

The wasp moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he got a job in the city government and quickly rose to prominence. After a few years, he decided to run for mayor. Many people in the city were understandably concerned. After all, a wasp mayor is not a common thing. The wasp was such a powerful speaker, though, that he managed to just barely eke out a victory. Once in office, his intellect and shrewdness proved to be exactly what the city needed. In the space of two years, crime and poverty had dropped to record lows, and the people were happier than ever.

After proving himself as mayor of a major city for a few terms, the wasp decided to run for governor of the whole state. The people of Atlanta were, of course, behind him 100%, but the rural areas of the state were much more skeptical. The wasp traveled the state extensively, meeting with small business owners and key figures in small towns. His humble beginnings and down-to-earth nature proved enough to get him elected, the first wasp governor in American history.

Just as he had in Atlanta, the wasp quickly turned to the business of revitalizing the state. Under his steady hand, Georgia experienced a rebirth of art and culture, and prosperity spread throughout the state. Many other states took note of his reforms and began implementing similar policies elsewhere in the country.

Once he had served three terms as governor of Georgia, the wasp decided it was time to go for the big one: President of the United States. It was a long, hard-fought campaign, and most media outlets predicted a loss for the wasp. After all, how could a wasp ever be elected President? It's simply unheard of. The wasp shocked the world, though, when on election day voters turned out in record numbers to vote for him. Many questions were raised about the legality of a wasp president following his stunning victory, but since the Constitution never specifies that a human is required for the office, the courts let the result stand.

As the wasp served his first term as President, many crises came and went, but always the wasp guided the country through with confidence. After four of the most prosperous years in recent memory, the wasp won his reelection in a landslide. Four more years passed, and the country had to say good-bye to one of the greatest Presidents ever to serve. The wasp decided that he had done enough in his life, and retired from politics. He had not been home in many years, and he missed his family.

So, the wasp went back to his hometown, to the nest where he grew up. The nest was ecstatic at his return, and threw a grand party in his honor. There was dancing, games, drinks, good friends, and everything else a good party needs. Now the wasp had been dancing and had worked up quite a thirst. He had heard that his mother had made her famous punch for the party, and he wanted to get some to quench his thirst. The wasp was slightly worried, however.

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""

""Don't count your chickens before they hatch."" Next up was little Johnny.

So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

I couldn't find him when finally I saw a guy hanging from the balcony, I beat him but he wouldn't drop so I took a hammer and hit all of his fingers. He landed in a bush after falling and I was so angry, I grabbed my fridge and threw it off the balcony, it landed on him and killed him but I died to because all of the stress gave me a heart attack. The angel said: Pretty tough day, how did you die he asked the 2nd man. The man said: well I was exercising on my balcony of my 26th floor apartment when I slipped and fell, luckily I landed on the balcony just below mine but I was holding on the ledge unable to get up, suddenly I saw a man walk out expecting him to help me but instead he started beating me! He went back inside and I thought he would get something to help but no, he had a hammer and hit my fingers causing me to fall but luckily I had landed In a bush. Suddenly a fridge fell from the sky and crushed me!

The usual signs. Phone rings, I answer, someone hangs up.

I always look out for her taxi coming home but she always walks down the drive although I can hear a car setting off. As if she has got out of the car round the corner. Why? Is it not a taxi? I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went beserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.
Anyway, I have never approached the subject with anybody. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth but last night she went out again and I decided to check on her. I decided I was going to hide behind my car which would give me a view of the whole street so I could see which car she gets out of. It was while crouched behind my car that I noticed rust around my rear wheel arch.
Should I take it into a body repair shop or should I buy some stuff from the local auto shop and try to repair it myself?

I saw a sudden flash of brown from the side of the road and felt something hit the car. I pulled over and saw I had hit rabbit. It's little whiskers were twitching, and I could tell he wasn't going to make it. I was trying to think how to put it out of it's misery when another car pulled behind me and a blonde walked out.

I explained what happened and she started sobbing. I felt awful, but suddenly she looked up and said, ""Wait! I have just the thing!""

She runs back to her car and pulls out a bag. She takes out his plastic container of something, and immediately begins pouring it all over the rabbit.

""Lady, what do you think you're trying to do?"" I asked.

Suddenly, the rabbit's right leg twitches, it's eyes open up wide, it gets back on all fours and runs perfectly fine back into the woods.

I turn and ask the blonde, ""What the hell did you use?!""

She stands up and with a big grin says, ""I used Pantene Pro-V! It restores dead hare!""",The Dead Rabbit,31

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
