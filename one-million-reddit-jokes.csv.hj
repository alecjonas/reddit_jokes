Let me tell it: One fucking beautiful evening, a man asked: why am I here? Nothing. He heard nothing, in return. His efforts were wasted, what a disappointment.  But then, he heard a voice say: ""You're questioning me? Have you no faith? I've given all, still you doubt."" the man replied: ""Well why am I here?"" Nothing, for what seemed like hours.

&amp;#x200B;

One night I dreamed a dream.

As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.

Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.

For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,

One belonging to me and one to my Lord.

&amp;#x200B;

After the last scene of my life flashed before me,

I looked back at the footprints in the sand.

I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,

especially at the very lowest and saddest times,

there was only one set of footprints.

&amp;#x200B;

This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.

""Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,

You'd walk with me all the way.

But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,

there was only one set of footprints.

I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""

&amp;#x200B;

He whispered, ""My precious child, I love you and will never leave you

Never, ever, during your trials and testings.

When you saw only one set of footprints,

It was then that I carried you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I then asked, ""Lord, what about when there was only one set of footprints,

and also a straight line with bootprints on one side and small, round circles on the other?""

The Lord replied, ""Those were the times that I carried you,

and we were joined by a pirate pushing a wheelbarrow.""

After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one thing.  So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear.  She smiled – the kind of smile that makes me smile back –and she said, “When I’m seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment.”

A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep.  The room was peaceful – almost silent.  All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing.  I stayed awake thinking about the time we’d spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible.  And at some point, I realized that it didn’t matter what we’d done or where we’d gone.  Nor did the future hold any significance.

All that mattered was the serenity of the moment.

He told the genie ""I don't want anything, to be honest."" The genie is shocked, as he has never encountered such a humble human. ""Nothing? Nothing at all? I can give you the world's riches! Give you the best intellect on the planet! I can make you the most attractive man in the universe! Fame! Everything!"" The man thinks for a little bit longer. He finally says to the genie ""Well, I hate flying, so can you do me this one thing?"" The genie was paying attention. ""Can you build me a bridge from California to Hawaii? I've always wanted to go but I hate flying."" The genie stood there shocked. ""But... It'll be impossible to do that! The depth of the ocean, the tides, the moon, it's impossible for me to do that!

So the first child was one, and the next was two, and so on.

Three years later the mother and her 99 children was in their home, when a catastrophic explosion happened from the furnace downstairs. This was so catastrophic, that only one baby survived, the baby named 90. 90, from then on, lived on her own, without any parents, sleeping on the streets, and eating out of dumpsters. 

When she was 8, a rich couple was walking down the street, and spotted 90. They saw her resourcefulness, and decided to adopt her. From then on, 90 had a great childhood, and when she was 22, decided to move out and have children of her own with her husband.

14 years later, 90 had five children. One day, the children found a puppy on the street. They wanted to take her home, however they knew their mother would not approve. Suddenly, one of the children had the idea to name the dog, “This”. They could sneak the dog in the shed as his home, and if they wanted to do something with this, they could say “Let’s take this outside!” So their mother would not catch on that they had a dog. The other kids agreed, and so they took this home.

The plan worked. Their mother did not catch on, and they had a dog that they loved. However, on one fateful day, one of the children didn’t lock up the dog properly, and ran out, into the street. The children looked, and didn’t have a second to react as the dog got hit by a car. They couldn’t believe it. The worst part is, they couldn’t cry, or their mother would catch on. And from that day forward, the children had saddened hearts. They couldn’t mourn openly. They couldn’t talk about it. They were heartbroken. And, even years later, it still affected them.



 

 


Only 90’s kids remember this.

Donut gets on the cruise ship at the port and they set sail later that day. Once on open waters, Mr. Donut goes up to the bridge and knocks on the door. The captain opens up and Mr. Donut is astounded. An actual sea captain. It's like all his dreams have come true. Mr. Donuts asks the captain if he can steer the ship and the captain says ""no Donut, were very busy go have fun on the deck"" Mr. Donuts sulks away and a few hours later comes back up. The captain again says no and that if Mr. Donut comes up one more time he'll lock him in his room. Mr. Donut leaves only to come back an hour later. The captain says ""now Donut, I told you what would happen"" and send the captain sends a crew member down to lock up Mr. Donut in his room. A few hours later, Donut sneaks out through an air vent and goes up to the bridge. The captain, angrily now, says ""Donut. Come up here one more time and I'll throw you off the ship."" Mr. Donut is again locked in his room. Later that night, Donut sneaks out and goes up to the bridge. He sees that the captain is asleep and then sees the captains hat on the captains nightstand. Donut sneaks into the captains quarters and steals the hat. He then goes up to the steering wheel and starts steering the ship. Now he's not actually steering the ship, but he doesn't know that. He puts on the hat and takes out his phone to send a selfie to all of his friends on the island. At that moment the captain wakes up and sees Mr. Donut. He comes up to Donut and screams ""DOOONUUT"" and throws him off the ship.

So there's this man who lives in Florida. He's 50 and super rich. He has everything he could ever want in life, except one thing. He's never found love. Sure he's had his flings, but he's never found the one. So, he sets out to find his soul mate. One day at an oyster bar, he meets this girl. The girl is about 25 and the two start taking and immediately fall in love. They date for a year and on their one year anniversary, the man says to himself, ""Today's the day. I'm going to propose."" He takes his girlfriend to the oyster bar they met at they order a platter of oysters. They're shucking them one by one when his girlfriend comes across an oyster that is larger and heavier than the rest. She's been expecting the proposal so she shakes near her ear and hears something moving around. Eagerly, she rips open the oyster, and THERE'S MISTER DONUT!",Two long jokes about a donut and a rich guy,0

However Christian was not pleased. Trent had betrayed his own species. Trent didn't care, he was a shark and he could go swim with the sharks. 

But all the sharks knew that Trent used to be a prawn and so shunned him. Trent was upset by this and realised that he was wrong to turn his back on his prawn brethren. So he set out again to find the cod, to wish to be a prawn again.

After much searching Trent eventually found the cod. ""No, I already gave you a wish. I will not grant another"". Trent was determined, however. He would not leave the cod alone. So the cod eventually relented and turned Trent back into a prawn.

Excited, Trent set out straight away to find his former prawn friends. Eventually he found his friend Christian and shouted:

The eldest without hesitation jumped into the well and pulled her out to the safety. Next morning when the eldest woke up, he saw a brand new car parked in his driveway. That was a gift from his mother in law as an appreciation.

A few days later, she is trying out the middle one. Same story, she asks him for a helping hand, jumps into a water well and he saved her. Next morning when he wakes up, he finds a brand new motor bike parked in his driveway. Again, that was a gift from his mother in law.

A few days later, now she is trying out the youngest one. She jumps into the water well but the youngest is hesitant to jump after her. He thinks for a few moments that the eldest saved her and got a car, the middle one saved her and got a bike so if I save her she'd probably give me a bicycle which is not worth the effort really so he decides to let her drown.

The next morning he wakes up to find a Ferrari parked up in his drive way. That was a gift from his father in law.

A dictator approaches one of his country's finest musicians, and asks him to compose a piece of music to be played by an orchestra in front of the country's ruling class.

The musician, not wanting to displease the glorious leader, sets to work immediately, and writes one of the greatest pieces he has ever written. A month passes, and the big day arrives. The musician stands in front of the orchestra, the rulers looking on, and signals the orchestra to play... and they absolutely butcher it.

The dictator, furious, demands that the musician be executed immediately. The guards drag him to a grimy cell, and ask him what he'd like for his last meal.

""I want the hottest curry you can cook!"" demands the musician.

The guards oblige, and bring the musician the spiciest curry he's ever tasted. He forces it down, and is led to the electric chair. The guards strap him down, pull the lever, and... nothing. The musician is completely unharmed! The dictator, having witnessed the miracle, decides to give the musician a second chance to compose a piece of music for the country's rulers.

The musician once again sets to work composing a beautiful piece. The big day arrives, the musician stands in front of his orchestra, and, once again, they completely ruin the piece. It was nothing like the musician intended it to sound! The fuming dictator again orders the execution of this incompetent musician.

As before, the musician is asked what he would like for his last meal.

""I want the hottest curry you can cook, and even hotter than last time!"" orders the musician.

The guards set to work and cook the musician the hottest curry they possibly can, throwing in a whole concoction of chili peppers and spices.

The musician, sweating, struggles to finish the curry, but chokes it down nonetheless. The guards once again lead him to the electric chair, and strap him down. They throw the switch, sparks fly, and once again, by some will of the gods, the musician is completely alive and well.

The dictator is stunned. He offers the musician one final chance to compose the greatest piece he can, and one chance only. The musician sets to work composing his greatest masterpiece, and finally the day of the concert arrives. The ruling classes look on as the musician takes to his podium. He raises his baton, takes a deep breath, and signals the orchestra to start playing.

The musician trembles. The orchestra are horribly out of key, out of time, and playing all the wrong chords. The dictator demands the concert be halted, and has the musician thrown in jail once again.

As before, the musician is asked what he would like for his final meal.

""The hottest curry that has ever been cooked!"" instructs the musician.

The dictator, upon hearing this request, snaps, ""absolutely not! I've had enough with you cheating death with your outrageously hot curries!""

The musician is dragged straight to the electric chair, and strapped down. He has wires connected to him in every place possible, and just for luck, the dictator announces that he will personally throw the switch this time.

The guards look on in angst. The dictator pulls the switch. Sparks fly and generators groan. The dictator holds the switch down for minutes on end before the power finally blows, yet, much to his amazement, the musician is completely unscathed!

""But, how?!"" demands the dictator. ""No man should survive that!""

""Oh!"" exclaims the musician. ""It had nothing to do with the curries! I'm just a terrible conductor!""",A fine conductor.,62

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. 

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knght with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.


The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.
The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","There were three kingdoms,",16

Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...

""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.""

The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.

""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.

Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.

""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!""

Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.

Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.

""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.

The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!""

The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.

The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!""

Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.

Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. ""I'VE GOT NOTHING!"" He shouts. ""I GIVE UP!""

The man steps aside.",A gambler dies and goes to Heaven...,254

The new nurse is chatting about how her nursing school is really pushing all kinds of new modern techniques and she can't wait to use them every day.

In the first patient's room, the nurse takes the man's blood pressure, and pulse, then she pulls up the man's gown and shoves her finger into his ass. After waiting a few seconds, she pulls it out and writes down something on his chart. The second nurse reminds her to take his temperature and the first nurse says she already put it on the chart. The second nurse checks and sure enough, there it is. She pulls out her rectal thermometer and double checks but the temp is right on.

So they go to the second patient and the procedure is repeated. Blood pressure, pulse, finger up the ass. The second nurse pulls out the rectal thermometer and double checks. Again, dead on.

Finally after the third repeat of the procedure, she says, ""You know, the only reliable way to get a core temperature is to use a rectal thermometer. I'm going to have to put you on report.""

The new nurse looks really hurt and says, ""This is one of those new techniques we were taught. Instead of using those old slow rectal thermometers, now we just use digital.""",A new nurse starts working at the hospital and is assigned to go take the vitals of the patients on the floor.,13

Their budget just wasn't high enough to afford high quality gear, but they were still beating out their richer rivals.

&amp;#x200B;

The top European horse racing organisations put together a group of specialist spies to try to find out how they were being beaten so convincingly by people who could barely afford to even feed their horses. Eventually, their investigations took them to a small hut with a cross on it in the centre of the vast plains, covered in huge racks of drying leather.

&amp;#x200B;

Inside, they find a shrivelled old man who seems to be shaping and blessing the rough leather, before cutting it into thin strips. They ask him what he is doing, and why these new jockeys are doing so well. He lifts his head and smiles.

He followed where the Abbot led,  
Who showed him to a room.  
'Goodnight and fare thee well to you -  
Sleep tight!' the Abbot said.  
'And may your dreams be just and true,  
Inside your humble bed.'  
But when he tried to sleep, he found  
A noise that started small -  
The most surprising, splendid sound  
Emerging through the wall.  
It made him think of sirens song -  
The secret chimes of Mars -  
The shrouded space where dreams belong -  
The voice beyond the stars.  
It made him think of hearts that yearn -  
The rhymes of wings unfurled -  
The passing beat of time to turn -  
The light beneath the world.  
It made him think of love and peace -  
The silent bliss behind -  
The perfect place where problems cease  
To vex the waking mind.  
The morning broke.  
The man awoke.  
'What was it, monks?' he cried.  
'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -  
'You're not a monk,' they sighed.  
'But what a sense the sounds evoke!  
Oh tell me, friends!' he cried.  
'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -  
'You're not a monk,' they sighed.  
'I have to know!' the man explained,  
And so, without remorse -  
He joined the house, and prayed and trained,  
To find the noise's source.  
He took the Test of Absent Bliss -  
The Woes of Anguish Drowned -  
He braved the Gulf of Faith's Abyss -  
And all to find the sound.  
He stood before the Secret Sect -  
The Path of Rousing Ploys -  
He stepped the steps of Last Respect -  
And all to find the noise.  
He crossed the Gate of Constant Grief -  
The Voids of Now and Then -  
He walked the Road of Lost Belief -  
To hear it once again.  
And when he'd pained and strained and bled,  
And most his life had passed -  
'You're ready now,' the others said,  
'To see the source at last.'  
They took him where the air was fair,  
And where, inside a trunk...  
I'd love to tell you what was there.  
Alas, you're not a monk. ","A poetic version of ""you are not a monk"" joke",16

It was for the English lesson that Mrs. Barker improvised to keep her lessons engaging. This was one off her stories. 

Once there was once a world where humans were either red, yellow or green. 

One day Mr. Green, a green human, woke up from his bed and took a shower. 
While showering his doorbell rang. Still showering, Mr. Green just simply take a towel and wrap his bottom half. 
When Mr. Green got to the door, he opened it and behind was Miss. Red, a red human, Mr. Green's neighbour. 
Miss. Red just needed to ask Mr. Green if he still had any flour left for a cake. While asking for the flour, Mr. Green's tower dropped on the floor. Frightened, Mrs. Red started running across the street to run away from Mr. Red but got knocked down by a Yellow car. 

After that Mrs. Barker asked her students : ""Kids, what's the moral of this story"".
No one knew the answer and some kids were just giggling at the back of the class. 

Mrs. Barker said :"" Well. The moral of the story is,
To not cross the road when the green man is flashing """,The story of Mr. Green.,9

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

Nick the Dragon slayer knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them.  
One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, who was the King's chief doctor. Horatio the Physician, exclaimed that he could arrange for Nick the Dragon Slayer to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1, 000 gold coins to arrange it.  
Without pause, Nick the Dragon Slayer readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio the Physician made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's brassiere while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.  
Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio the Physician informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick the Dragon Slayer would work as the antidote to cure the itch.  
The King quickly summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer. Horatio the Physician then slipped Nick the Dragon Slayer the antidote for the itching powder, which he quickly put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's voluptuous and magnificent breasts.  
The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick the Dragon Slayer left satisfied and touted as a hero. Upon returning to his chamber, Nick the Dragon Slayer found Horatio the Physician demanding his payment of thousand gold coins.  
With his obsession now satisfied, Nick the Dragon Slayer couldn't have cared less and, knowing that Horatio the Physician could never report this matter to the King, with a laugh just told him to get lost. The next day, Horatio the Physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer...

This did not go unnoticed by the dwarves. Being the little perverts they are, they decided to climb on each other's shoulders outside her window to peep on her changing. The one on top would then whisper the one below what he sees, who would then whisper to the one below him, and so on.

As Snow White returned to her room for the night, the dwarves quickly rushed outside and started forming the tower. Doc on the top then started to narrate summarily what was going on upstairs.

The chain of whispers went: ""unbuttoning blouse"", ""unbuttoning blouse"", unbuttoning blouse""...

""Removing skirt"", ""Removing skirt"", ""Removing skirt""...

""Removing bra"", "" Removing bra"", ""Removing bra""...

It was at this point, that Snow White noticed the murmur, and turned to the window to see Doc looking at her, now surprised. Furious, she started to rush towards the window, which prompted Doc to shout out: ""Coming!""

And the tower of dwarves replied:

""Me too!""

""Me too!""

But her mother was really annoyed with this situation because she was having an affair with another man after her husband left. 

One day, she let her boyfriend in to the bedroom without checking if the girl was there again. Unexpectedly, the husband arrived form work and she hid her boyfriend in the closet. While the little girl and the boyfriend were looking at each other in confusion, husband and wife started taking each other’s clothes off…

This dialogue started between the boyfriend and the little girl:

\- Mister?

\- Yes?

\- I have a white teddy bear.

\- And? 

\- You are going to buy it.

\- I am a grown man, what would I do with it?

\- No. You are going to buy it.

\- Not a chance!

\- You are going to buy it, or else… I will tell my father.

\- Ok, shut up! How much?

\- 50 Bucks

\- Piss off little brat! I would never give 50 dollars to THAT.

\- Ok then I will let my father know!

\- Alright. Get this 50 dollar bill and shut up.

20 minutes passed, but the married couple was still having sex in the room.

\- Mister!

\- What again?!

\- Give my teddy bear back.

\- No way, I just paid 50 dollars for that.

\- Then I will tell my father.

\- Take it and shut your little mouth.

After a while again

\- Mister, my white bear…

\- Hmmm…

\- You are going to buy it again for 100 bucks. 

\- Hmppffffff

This exchange continued until dawn. The little girl collected whatever valuable the guy had on him. Next day she bought herself a gorgeous bicycle. When her mother arrived:

\- Where did you find it?

\- I found the money on the ground.

\- Baby this is not the right way. You have sinned. Give the bike back, take the money and donate it to the church. While you are there, tell them how you found the money and confess.

Reluctantly, the little girl did everything that her mother told her. After donating the money, she sat on the other side of the veil that the priest was standing and started to confess.   

\- Father, I have sinned. See I have this white teddy bear…

\- You are such a pain in the ass little bitch!",The little girl’s favorite activity was to play with her white teddy bear in her parents’ closet.,5

Now, Juan is a pretty amazing guy. He can steal ANYTHING he wants to. Literally anything. It could be the shirt off your back, the wallet in your pocket, or I'm even sure he'd find a way to steal your house (And your spouse too). So anyway, one day Juan and I are sitting around watching TV, and they announced that the hope diamond will not be on display anymore and is now getting moved to an undisclosed location. So as we hear this, Juan says ""I'm gonna steal it"". Now I know how good Juan is at this kind of stuff, so I just tell him good luck and he goes on his way. Eventually he narrows his search down to a small cave in South Africa. When Juan gets there, he doesn't see any guards or anything outside the cave, so he just walks in assuming he was wrong about where the diamond was. He wanders around for a while until he sees a long lit hallway with the hope diamond at the end of it. Confident in his abilities, he strolls over to the diamond and picks it up before realizing its a trap! Suddenly, red lights flashed, armed men came running out, sirens went off. You could hear one of the men say under his breath ""We finally caught Juan Ted."" But Juan, being the best thief in the world, said ""Not quite. On the count of three, I will disappear."" As the men looked around confused, Juan began to count. ""Uno. Dos."" And he disappeared without a tres.",I've got a story...,6

His last-minute plea for clemency to the governor had failed and he was feeling worn out and depressed.
As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him about, 'What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been? Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'. And on and on and on.Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs.While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight. Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go upstairs and give him the good news.As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet.


They're not hanging Wright tonight,' she said.

“ Nothing can really be impossible, it just looks like it is cause nobody’s seen it happen yet.” 

“Really?” The first student replied. “So huge dinosaurs could still be around and people just don’t know about them?”

“Sure.”

“No way. How would nobody notice all the people getting eaten by dinos all the time?” 

“ Maybe people  think some other animal is doing it, like a bear or something.” 

“So then zombies and ghouls and stuff couldn’t be impossible too, right?” A third student added. 

“Yep.” Said the first.

Several more students began to take notice of the conversation.

“Even vampires?”
 “The transformers?” 
“Godzilla?”
“Magic?”

Her friend suggests that she visit the Haitian store and she will get help. The woman is curious so she goes to the store and bashfully explains her situation to the store owner. He pulls out a wooden phallus and says, ""This is a Voodoo Dick. All you have to do is say 'Voodoo Dick' and where you want it to go, and it will fly there and make passionate love to it. When you want it to stop just say 'Voodoo Dick stop' and it will stop.""

The woman is sceptical, so the man says, ""Voodoo Dick, the wall,"" and the thing flies to the wall and starts ramming it. The man says, ""Voodoo Dick, stop,"" and it drops to the ground. The woman is impressed so she pays him and rushes home.

At home, she throws rose petals on the bed, puts on some Boyz II Men, lies on the bed and eagerly shouts, ""Voodoo Dick, my pussy!"" The thing flies to her and starts giving it to her. It's good. It's the best. In fact, she has never experienced anything so passionate and savage at the same time.

An hour goes by and she's having the time of her life. Two hours and she starts tiring out. By three hours she has had enough, but she has forgotten how to make the possessed wiener stop. The woman tries, ""Voodoo Dick, cut it out. Voodoo Dick, quit it. Voodoo Dick, enough,"" but nothing works.

She starts to panic. Since it's night time and the Haitian store is closed, the woman decides that maybe the hospital can help her. She struggles down the stairs and into her car, all the while the demonic pecker is pounding away at her. The entire way to the hospital she drives recklessly: skipping red lights, hopping onto sidewalks, and swerving into oncoming traffic.

A traffic cop sees this, pursues her, and pulls her car over. He walks up to the driver's window and asks the woman why she was driving like a maniac. Very embarrassed, she explains how she purchased a Voodoo Dick from a Haitian store and tried it out at home, but forgot how to make it stop.

In disbelief, the cop bursts out laughing and says, ""Vodoo Dick, my ass!""",Vodoo Dick,21

Jerry hated his life though, and he would curse god for making him this way every day, and he prayed and prayed for God to help his knee grow. One day, God appeared to Jerry. Jerry tried to say, “Ernest Nee, you evil twat, make my knee more normal”. But god disappeared before Jerry could finish his sentence, as He was very busy. Jerry got one more chance a few years later, and he had to be quick about what he said, so he shouted, “E. Nee, meanie, my knee mo’!”","A long time ago, God had a name",8

After 5(!) centuries the snail says “F*ck it!” And right when he’s about to take a bite out of the fry the other snail jumps out of a bush and screams “HA! I KNEW YOU WOULDNT WAIT FOR ME YOU SOB!”",Two snails in a desert,3

He begs his friend to tell him how he did it, and his friend tells him about this shaman who lives in a small village in the middle of Africa. He can cure anything; just bring a sheep, a few chicken and some packs of cigarettes as barter.

He buys a ticket the next day, lands in Africa and treks all the way to the village. He finds the shaman, gives him the sheep, chicken and cigarettes and tells him about his problem.

The shaman says he can fix this by attaching the trunk of a baby elephant to his groin. He will then be hung like a horse!

The guy is shocked at the proposed solution, but he's desperate so he decides to go for it. The shaman puts him under and performs the procedure. The guy wakes up and finds out he's super hung! He's ecstatic!

He rests for a few days before flying back home. Once home he immediately gets on Tinder, and with his newfound confidence he suddenly appears extremely attractive to the ladies and he lands a date for the next day.

He decides to make this a fancy date, and invites the lady to a high end French restaurant. They meet and get a table, and the waiter brings them some freshly baked buns with butter while they go over the menu.

They start talking about each other when suddenly, something comes out from under the table, steals a bun and disappears!

The guy's becomes completely red in the face, but to his surprise his date is really impressed. She looks at him with glee and excitement and asks if he can perform that trick again, to which he responds: I don't think my ass can fit another bun!

""What majestic trees! What a powerful river! What beautiful animals!"" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its right paw to strike him. 

""OH MY GOD! ..."" 


Time stopped. 


The bear froze. 


The forest was silent. 


Even the river stopped moving ... 


As a brilliant light shone upon the man, a thunderous voice came from all around... 


""YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON'T EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A BELIEVER?"" 


Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and said, ""It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?"" 


""VERY WELL."" Said God. 


The light went out. 


The river ran. 


The sounds of the forest resumed. 


... and the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws together, bowed his head and spoke: ""Lord, thank you for this food which I am about to receive."" ","Bless us, oh Lord...",97

It was 10 miles long and 3 miles wide; a floating city. Once the ship was complete, Bob had to hire thousands of people to work on it and make it run properly. He held mass interviews and hired sailors, policemen, chefs, janitors, teachers, firemen and hundreds more. After weeks of interviews, Bob saw there was only one applicant left; an old man sitting on a chair.

""What is it you do, sir?"" Bob asked.

""I'm a Kooshmaker."" Said the old man.

Now Bob had no idea what a Kooshmaker was, but he was too embarrassed to ask. ""You're in luck,"" Bob said, ""we don't have a Kooshmaker yet. You're hired.""

The next day, Bob set sail. While roaming the high seas, Bob walked around his ship, checking up on his new hires. He saw chefs cooking, sailors running the ship and was happy everyone seemed to be doing their job. Everyone, that is, except for the Kooshmaker.

""Kooshmaker, why aren't you working?"" Bob asked.

""I don't have any material."" The Kooshmaker replied.

""Well, just tell me what you need and you'll get it.""

""I need a large workshop and 10 tons of super mega steel."" Said the Kooshmaker.

So Bob set the Kooshmaker up with a giant workshop below deck. ""Where can we get super mega steel?"" He asked.

""We can get it in Australia."" Said the Kooshmaker.

So Bob changed course and sailed down to Australia where he purchased 10 tons of super mega steel. The Kooshmaker thanked him, took it all to his workshop and got busy.

For days on end, all through the ship, everyone could hear the Kooshmaker working, going:

Snap, crackle, pop.

Snap, crackle, pop. 

Snap, crackle, pop. 

Snap, crackle, STOP.  
Then Bob ran down the stairs. He knocked on the door and said, ""Kooshmaker! Kooshmaker! Are you done yet?""  
And the Kooshmaker said, ""No. I need more super mega steel.""  
""But we bought all the super mega steel in Australia, where else can we get it?""  
""Brazil."" He said.  So they set sail for Brazil where they purchased 20 tons of super mega steel.The Kooshmaker then took it all down to his workshop and got busy.  
For days on end, all through the ship, everyone could hear the Kooshmaker working, going:  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, STOP.  
Then Bob ran down the stairs. He knocked on the door and said, ""Kooshmaker! Kooshmaker! Are you done yet?""  
And the Kooshmaker said, ""No. I need more super mega steel.""  
""But we bought all the super mega steel in Brazil, when else can we get it?""  
""India."" He said.  So they set sail for India where they purchased 30 tons of super mega steel. The Kooshmaker then took it all down to his workshop and got busy.  
For days on end, all through the ship, everyone could hear the Kooshmaker working, going:  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, pop.  
Snap, crackle, STOP.  
Then Bob ran down the stairs. He knocked on the door and said, ""Kooshmaker! Kooshmaker! Are you done yet?""  
And the Kooshmaker said, ""Yes.""  
Bob was ecstatic, as was everyone else on the ship. They were so excited to finally find out what the Kooshmaker had been working on for so long.  
The next day everyone gathered on the deck for the big reveal. Bob stood in front of everyone and with a flourish he shouted, ""I now present, the Kooshmaker!""  
Everyone cheered as the Kooshmaker pulled back a giant tarp but they all went quiet when they saw that under it was just a giant chain. A chain with links so huge they were as big as a house. The chain went all the way around the ship and on the other end, the chain got smaller until it was small enough to fit in the Kooshmaker's hand.   
After a minute of dead silence, the Kooshmaker started to swing the chain over his head. He swung faster and faster. As he picked up speed the ship began to sway. Then it started to spin. It started to spin so fast that it began to rise up out of the water like a helicopter!  
The Kooshmaker kept swinging and spinning and the ship started to fly higher and higher. Everyone on the ship was freaking out, especially Bob.  
Bob ran over to the Kooshmaker and started to yell, ""what are you doing?! You're going to kill us all!""  
But the Kooshmaker ignored him. So Bob yelled again, ""as your boss, I order you to stop this at once or you're fired!""  
The Kooshmaker looked at Bob and after a few seconds he stopped swinging the chain. The ship stopped spinning and began to fall.  
It fell faster and faster. Clouds were rushing past it as it hurtled downward toward the ocean.   
Bob screamed, ""Kooshmaker, what have you done!""  
The ship kept plummeting, falling and falling until it finally hit the water and went:  
KOOOOOOOSH","To his great surprise, Bob won the largest lottery in history.",58

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper.  Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily. 

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’  The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself.  She stops at a sweet shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’ 

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going.  Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was.  It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands in your knickers  Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her.  She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands into her panties and begins to feel around very slowly and gently caresses her nicely trimmed muff. He pushes her lips apart and gently slides his fingers in and out of her now moist pussy. 

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last finger of her clitorus, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you in the queue at McDonalds’.","A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. She spends £15,000 and looks sensational.",657

The third invests the money in the stock market. She earns several times the $5000. She gives him back his $5000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much. Obviously, the man was impressed.

After some discussion with his wife, the man made a visit to the herbalist and handed his voucher over wondering what he was in for. The elderly herbalist handed a potion to the man, and with a grip on his shoulder warned him.

""This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want.""

Greatly encouraged, the man turned and started to walk away, then stopped and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""

The herbalist replied, ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,' but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""

Eager to see if it worked the man went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

They talk. They connect. They end up leaving together.  


They  get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment she  notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with  soft,sweet, cuddly teddy bears. There are three shelves in the bedroom,  with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed  in rows, covering the entire wall! It was obvious that he had taken  quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched  by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.  


There  were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears  covering the length of the middle shelf,and huge, enormous bears running  all the way along the top shelf. She found it strange for an obviously  masculine guy to have such a large collection of Teddy Bears, She is  quite impressed by his sensitive side but doesn’t mention this to him.  


They  share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she  finds herself thinking, ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!  Maybe he could be the future father of my children?’  


She turns to  him and kisses him lightly on the lips He responds warmly. They  continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in  his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off each  other’s clothes and make hot, steamy love.  


She is so overwhelmed  that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she  has ever known. After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with  this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow. The  woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly,  


""Well,how was it?’  


The guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says...

'House' for instance, is feminine: 'la casa.'

'Pencil,' however, is masculine: 'el lapiz.'

A student asked, 'What gender is 'computer'?'

Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups, male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether 'computer' should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.

The men's group decided that 'computer' should definitely be of the feminine gender ('la com putadora'), because:

No one but their creator understands their internal logic;

The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;

Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval, and;

As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.

IT GETS BETTER!

The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be Masculine ('el computador'), because:

In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;

They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;

They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem, and;

As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.

So as we hear this, Juan says ""I'm gonna steal it"".  Now I know how good Juan is at this kind of stuff, so I just tell him good luck and he goes on his way.  Eventually he narrows his search down to a small cave in South Africa.  When Juan gets there, he doesn't see any guards or anything outside the cave, so he just walks in assuming he was wrong about where the diamond was.  He wanders around for a while until he sees a long lit hallway with the hope diamond at the end of it.  Confident in his abilities, he strolls over to the diamond and picks it up before realizing its a trap!  Suddenly, red lights flashed, armed men came running out, sirens went off.  You could hear one of the men say under his breath ""We finally caught Juan Ted."" But Juan, being the best thief in the world, said ""Not quite.  On the count of three, I will disappear."" As the men looked around confused, Juan began to count.  ""Uno.  Dos."" And he disappeared without a tres.",I've got a story for you...,3

Onestone finally cracked and said,'

If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'

The word got around and nobody called him that any more.

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said,

'Good morning, Onestone.' He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.

He made love to her all the next day,

Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until

A woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.

Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin,

Was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.

She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,

Then he made love to her all day,

Made love to her all night,

Made love to her all the next day,

Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

Trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings. The teacher asks Trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word “tragedy”. (No, not the punch line yet)

So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers, “if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.”

“Not quite”, says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. “Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “

Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, “If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaimed Mr. Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

“Well’, said little Johnny, “because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”",What is the best Donald Trump joke you've heard?,29928
