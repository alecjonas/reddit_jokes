While reading an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink.
Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house.
I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it.
Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it.
Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it.
I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope!
In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it!
By the time I realized she just didn't like to drink, I was so shit-faced I could hardly push her stroller back home!!!

Before he could say more than a word or two, the druggist told him, “Now, just a minute – listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm failed to go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, but I’ll be damned if I didn’t lock the house with both house and car keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Then, about three blocks from the store I had a flat tire. When I finally got to the store there was a bunch of people waiting for me to open up.

I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing its head off. Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor.

I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels – the phone is still ringing – when I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it, and half of them hit the floor and broke.

The youngest son, asked his dad how he was named because his friend, Sharp Spear, told him that his name came from what his dad is known for- sharpening spears for the village men. The chief looked at his son, and told him the following, “Son, on the night your mother and I decided to have a third child, we were out in the woods. When we finished the deed required to have another child- we saw a strong buffalo running out in front of the rest. We then decided our child would be named Running Buffalo. That’s how you were named.”

This excited the child and also the middle son, who decided to inquire too. He asked his father how he was named. The chief spoke, “Shooting Star, you’re quite a magnificent story. The night your mother and I made you, a bright red shooting star went across the summer sky. We then knew at that moment, you would be named Shooting Star.” 

The middle son boasted proudly that he had a great story for his name. The oldest son then looked at his dad. Before he could ask the chief, the chief spoke, “Listen here Busted Rubber...”",Native American Chief and his 3 sons,21

While he's able to distract himself for the first few days, he soon starts to get a little bit ""antsy,"" and wonders how, exactly, he's meant to contend with that. Finally, feeling rather embarrassed, he approaches another soldier.

""Listen, man,"" the newly arrived soldier whispers, ""I was a teenager once. I know how to 'take care of things' without much for inspiration... but come on! There must be something around here to help 'ease the tension.'""

""You're using a lot of euphemisms,"" the seasoned soldier responds.

""Shut up and tell me the secret,"" answers the newly arrived soldier.

""Well, which do you want me to do?""

The newly arrived soldier rolls his eyes, becoming irritated at the length of this joke. ""Just tell me!""

After glancing around to make sure that nobody is listening, the seasoned soldier leans in close. ""Okay, listen: Out behind the barracks, there's a tree. Tied to that tree is a camel. When you're feeling... you know...""

Before the seasoned solider can finish, the newly arrived soldier makes a sound of disgust and pulls away. ""That's horrible!"" he shouts, and he struts off in a huff.

Still, as the sun sets and the young man finds it increasingly impossible to fall asleep, he decides to bite the proverbial bullet and give the ""local remedy"" a try. He sneaks out behind the barracks, and sure enough, there's a camel tied to a tree there. After taking a few deep breaths (and finding a bucket on which to stand), the soldier drops his pants. The next several minutes of this joke have been removed for decency's sake, but suffice to say that the soldier finally got some rest that night.

The following morning, the newly arrived solider approaches the seasoned soldier who told him about the camel.

""Well, I did it,"" he says. ""It wasn't as bad as I thought.""

""Yeah, you get used to it,"" the seasoned soldier replies. ""My first time, though, I thought that camel-ride to the brothel would last forever.""",A soldier is stationed in the middle east...,80

He couldn't take an airline flight because there wasn't enough room for him in the seats, and they wouldn't let him travel Air Freight.

Trump nods and the Chief continues: ""The bad news is the culprit is Vice President Mike Pence.""

 The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind.
 He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. 


The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" 


The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" 


The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" 

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. 

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" 

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" 

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...

J: ""Uncle doctor, uncle doctor, can I ask you something?""

D: ""Yes Johnny?""

J: ""Uncle doctor, I would sooooo love to have a little brother. I already asked my mom, and she said if it was for her, I could have one, but she says daddy is no longer up to the deed. His flag is on half mast, whatever that means. But I sooo much want to have a little brother.""

D: ""Well Johnny, I think I can help there. See that little flask? Just put a single drop of that essence in your father's morning coffee every four days, and you will see, you will have a little brother in no time.""

Johnny is mad with happiness, he can't believe his luck. He thanks the doctor and runs home chanting and singing, and jumping and rejoicing. However, in his happiness, he mixes up what the doctor said, and therefore starts to put four drops of the essence into his father's morning coffee every day.

Half a year later he meets the doctor on his way home from school:

D: ""So, little Johnny? Is your brother already on the way? Are you happy now?""

""Happy? HAPPY???"" he shouts out. ""Is that a freaking joke?"" His head going purple he starts screaming: ""Mom's dead, my sister is pregnant, my ass is sore, and the dog hasn't come home in weeks!""",Little Johnny wants a brother,0

might have a tapeworm. The doctor makes a physical examination and
listens to the symptoms, and concurs with the self-diagnosis.
""I want you to come back tomorrow, to start treatment. And bring a
banana and a cookie with you"" said the doctor.

Despite the seemingly odd request, our hero complies, and returns the
next day with a banana and a cookie. The doctor says ""Okay, now drop
your pants and bend over. This is going to hurt a bit.""

Although leery about the turn of events, the patient drops his pants
and bends over. The doctor peels the banana and with one deft motion
rams it up the guy's ass. While the doctor consults
his watch, our hero dances around the room shouting at the doctor.

""Okay, one minute is up, and we have to complete the second part of the
treatment if your truly want to get rid of this tapeworm"" advises doc.
Despite the pain, the patient does want to be cured, so complies with
the order to bend over again. Again, the doctor takes the cookie and
rams it up the patients ass.

""Okay, tomorrow I want to see you here at the same time, and bring
another banana and a cookie"" says the doctor. The now humbled patient,
with tears of pain in his eyes, nods his head.

Next day, the same routine ensues. First the doctor rams up a banana,
waits exactly one minute, then rams up a cookie.

And the next day, and the next day and the next!! Every day UP goes a
banana, wait one minute, then UP goes a cookie.

After one full week of treatments, the doctor finally says ""Well,
tomorrow is the LAST day of treatments. I want you to bring in a
banana and a hammer.""

""Not a cookie?"" asks the very frightened patient, trying to imagine what
a hammer was going to feel like. ""Nope, a hammer"" confirmed the
doctor.

The last day the doctor says ""Okay, you know the routine"". So the man
drops his pants and bends over. UP goes the banana, and the doctor
looks at his watch and picks up the hammer. One minute passes. Then
two minutes. Three. Four minutes pass. Then a little head pokes out
the patient's ass and says ""WHERE'S MY FUCKING COOKIE!?!?""",Just one minute,29

Surprised, she asks, ""Why did you have that in your pocket?"" The waiter replies, ""We had a performance analyst come into the restaurant a while back and he told us that when a customer drops something, seven times out of ten it's a spoon. He suggested that we all start carrying spoons to increase speed and efficiency."" That made good enough sense for the couple so they thank the waiter and finish their soup. Fifteen minutes later, as the waiter walks by the table the couple notices a small string hanging from his fly. Curiosity getting the better of them, they stop him and ask what it's for. ""Well, the performance analyst  told the men that if we tied strings to our zippers, we could pull them down when we need to use the bathroom without touching...um...anything.

“Alright, I have some good news and I’ve got some bad news”, says the doctor. The man asks to start with the bad news. 

“First of all, your mother-in-law is not going to die. She will probably live for about 20-30 more years. She suffered from a major stroke and unfortunately has some pretty bad side effects from it”

The man prepares himself for the worst.

“The stroke somehow ruined her ability to speak so she makes a loud screeching noise like a parrot. She will need to be under constant supervision. Her motor functions have also taken a hit so she will not be able to perform certain tasks like bathing and eating, so you and your wife will have to give her a bath and feed her everyday for the next 20-30 years.”

The man is hoping that is all the doctor has to say...

“She also has a form of incontinence so she will have to wear a diaper that you and your wife will have to change for the next 20-30 years. I’m really sorry, this must be a lot to process”

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed...... On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again...... On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

There was only one problem: the captain’s parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. 

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show “look, it’s not the same hat”,  or  “look, he’s hiding flowers under the table”, or “ hey, why are all of the cards aces?”

The magician was furious but couldn’t do anything. It was, after all, the captains parrot. 

One stormy night on the pacific, the ship unfortunately sank. 

The magician found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it, with the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but didn’t utter a word

This went on for a day, then two days, then three days. Finally the parrot couldn’t hold back and said

“Okay I give up, where’s the ship?”

The doorbell rang, and the farmer answered the door. The boy said:

""Hi, my name's Joe, I'm here for Flowe. We're going to the show, is she ready to go?""

The farmer decided that he was alright, and he sent his daughter off. Soon after, the doorbell rang again. The boy said:

""My name's Eddy. I'm here for Betty. We're gonna get some spaghetti; is she ready?""

The farmer again decided that he was alright, and he sent his next daughter off with the boy. The doorbell rang a third and final time, and he again answered the door. The boy started off:

Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while at Home Depot. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you. Here's how the scam works:
Two seriously good-looking 20 year-olds girls come over to your car as you are loading your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex window cleaner, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and instead ask you for a ride to McDonalds. You agree and they get into the back seat. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and goes down on you while the other one slips her hand between the seats and steals your wallet...!!
I had my wallet stolen December 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th &amp; 28th. Also January 1st &amp; 2nd twice on the 8th &amp; 9th, and three times last Saturday and very likely again this upcoming weekend. So tell your friends to be careful. P.S. Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each -- I found cheaper ones for $1.99 at target

so the frenchman asks for a knife, and when the chief hands it to him, he says:

""I will not die by the hands of you animals! VIVA LA FRANCE!"" and gallantly raises the knife he stabs himself in the heart.

the Englishman again, asks for a knife. he says:

""like my brethren from across the water, I shall not die by the hand of you utter mongrels, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!!"" 
and just like the frenchman, he stabs himself in the heart.

now, only the Aussie is left, and when the chief asks him what item he wants, he asks for a fork. Puzzled, the chief hands him a fork and he proceeds to stab himself about 15 times all over his body. He hands the fork back to the confused chief and says

Now it's a friday night, and the bar's crowded, and he notices that every time someone orders a drink it's the same. The cash goes in the register, the change goes in the jar.

Finally, his curiosity gets the better of them. He signals the bartender over and says ""Excuse me, but what's with the jar?""

""Oh that?"" The bartender says. ""That's our Weekly Challenge Jar. Every week we have a challenge and whoever completes it gets the money in the jar.""

""There must be $50 in there,"" the man says. ""What's today's challenge?""
""Well, see,"" the bartender says, ""There's an old dog out back, a rottweiler with an infected tooth. We tried to get him to an animal dentist but nobody would go near his mouth since he's a bit aggressive. So you gotta take this pair of pliers here and go pull the dog's tooth.""

""That sounds dangerous,"" says the man, ""but I'd do it for $50.""

""That's not all,"" says the bartender. ""The guy who owns the bar is upstairs, and he has the ugliest daughter in the world. She's so ugly, she's about to turn 30 and has never been with a man. After you pull the dog's tooth, you've gotta go upstairs and, uh, deflower her.""

""For $50?!? Fuck that! I'll just have a whiskey."" The guy pays the bartender $5 for the whiskey, and $2 goes in the jar, $3 in the register. The bartender shrugs it off as his loss.

Well, the night goes on and the jar keeps getting fuller, and the guy keeps getting drunker. Finally, just after last call, the guy is sitting there drunkenly watching the bartender count the change jar. The bartender mentions that the change jar has $800 in it, and the guy says ""Fuck it. I'll do it for $800.""
The bar goes SILENT. The bartender asks ""Are you sure? Nobody's ever actually done a weekend challenge before.""

""Yeah, I'll do it. Fuck it."" The man drunkenly slurs. He finishes his drink and slams it on the counter, grabs the bartender's pliers, and all eyes are on him as he walks towards the back door.

He opens the back door and the bar gasps as they hear the dog barking and snarling, and he sounds PISSED. The door closes, and the dog barks louder as the man yells. The sounds escalate as the two snarl and yell at each other outside.

Finally, the guy enters the bar triumphantly, covered in beer, blood, and dog saliva. He holds the empty pliers triumphantly into the air and yells

“Well, you seem to be drinking too much before you go to bed. Try not to have any liquids an hour before you sleep,” replied the doctor.

Being unable to contain his surprise, he blurts out, ""Mate, I have the same tattoo! When I get hard, it says my wife's name: WendY""

The jamaican man, a little taken a back, but certainly not offended says ""Ahh, that's nice. Mine says: Welcome to the republic of Jamaica, I hope you enjoy your staY"".",[Long] A brit visits Jamaica,14

At this point the two men are really intrigued over this large hole. So they look around a little for something bigger to throw in, and they come across an old rusty anvil. They both grab an end, walk it over to the hole, and throw it in.
The men are looking down the hole when all of a sudden they hear this noise in the woods. They look over and see this goat running all over the place. It’s ziging and zaging between trees and going all over the place. Then it runs right up and dives into the hole.

Now the two men are thinking, what the hell was that? They had no idea what that goat was doing.

A few minutes later they hear a farmer walking through the woods calling ""Becky! Becky!""

He is very injured and barely crawls to the entrance. After a few weak knocks, a monk opens the door and looks down at the soldier on the ground. The soldier asks ""Will you please hide me and give me sanctuary?"" The monk nods and a few others come to help the soldier inside. After a few days the soldier is feeling better and has recovered enough to walk around the monastery without any assistance. One night after a hardy feast with the monks, the soldier is laying in bed when he hears a noise. It is very faint but it is one that he is not familiar with hearing at the monastery. So he gets up to investigate. After a few minutes of searching, the soldier comes to a large red curtain. He grabs the curtain and feels the thickness and weight of it. Even being nearly three inches thick he can clearly hear that the noise is coming from behind the curtain. So he pushes the curtain to the side and behind it stands two tall wooden doors with intricate designs and holy symbols. At this point he realizes that he is tired and his body is relatively sore, so he closes the curtain and heads back to his room for the night. 

The next morning he finds the monk that helped him the day he arrived. ""What was that noise from last night, monk?"" He asks. The monk tells him, ""I cannot tell you. You are not a monk."" The soldier shrugs and thinks nothing more of it. 
That night he is awoken by the same noise. He gets out of his bed and walks to where he found the curtain. He opens the curtain and examines the wooden doors behind them. He puts his ear to the doors and can hear the noise more clearly. So he swings open the doors and behind them is a gray garage door. It is one of the garage doors that you bend over and pick up manually from the bottom. At this point he is feeling tired and not up for the challenge of lifting anything. So he closes the wooden doors and moves the curtain back in front of the doors.

The next morning he approaches the monk once more. ""Monk you have to tell me what that noise was!"" He demands. The monk simply looks back at him and says, ""I cannot tell you. You are not a monk."" The soldier glares at him momentarily then shrugs and walks away. However, he is slightly annoyed this time. That night he is already awake when he hears the noise. He promptly gets up and goes over the curtains. The soldier opens the curtains, swings open the doors, and lifts the garage door. Behind the garage door is a massive book shelf filled with books from all ages of the past. After looking through a few of the books and reading about philosophers and religious figures, he hears the noise again coming from behind the bookshelf. So he begins pulling every book from the shelf. An hour passes and he gets to the last few books. He pulls one from the shelf and the bookshelf shakes then moves to the side. Behind the bookshelf is three tunnels and above each tunnel is a number. ""1"", ""2"", and ""3."" The soldier glances back at the mound of books he created on the floor and decided to save the tunnels for another time. He puts the books back on the shelf, closes the garage door, closes the large wooden doors, and moves the curtain back in front of the doors.

The next morning at breakfast he pulls the monk from his chair and demands, ""TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS OR I WILL FIND OUT MYSELF!"" The monk looks into the soldier's eyes and says, ""I cannot tell you, you are not a monk."" Livid, the soldier pushes the monk to the side and runs to the curtain where the noise comes from. He opens the curtain, opens the wooden doors, lifts the garage door, and pulls the secret book to expose the three tunnels. Without thinking, he darts down the first tunnel to the left. Running and running the soldier is so determined he doesn't move slower than a brisk jog. After about an hour he sees a light at the end of the tunnel finally. He darts for the light and comes out the other tunnel number 3 on the right side. In the middle remains tunnel number ""2"". He enters the tunnel. Before long he can see a light at the end. He takes off running to the light and comes out into a large library. The vault ceilings stretch high above him and host a painting of angels and god. The floor is covered in luscious red carpet. The walls are covered in books from the floor to the ceiling. In the middle of the room is a long wooden table, polished and reflective, surrounded by 12 chairs. On the table is a chest covered in gems, diamonds, and gold. The noise is coming from within the chest. The soldier approaches the chest and notices there is already a golden key inserted into the front keyhole.

He turns the key. 

The chest opens. 

What was inside?

I cannot tell you. You are not a monk. ",A soldier seeks sanctuary at a monastery,13
