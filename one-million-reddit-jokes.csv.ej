The Audi engineer asks for a metal bed and a dog. Confused, the commander gives him what he asked for. The Audi engineer takes four springs from the bed and attaches them to the dogs feet and climbs onto the dog. Guiding the dog into the minefield he bounces his way across and emerges on the other side without a scratch on him or the dog. The Commander, a man true to his word announces that he is free, but asks 'how did you do this? I do not understand the dog and the springs?'

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

The Confusing Country
Australia is a very confusing place, taking up a large amount of
the bottom half of the planet. It is recognizable from orbit because of
any unusual features, including what at first looks like an enormous
bite taken out of its southern edge; a wall of sheer cliffs which plunge deep
into the girting sea. Geologists assure us that this is simply an accident
of geomorphology and plate tectonics, but they still call it the
""Great Australian Bight"" proving that not only are they covering up a more
frightening theory, but they can't spell either.
The first of the confusing things about Australia is
the status of the place. Where other land masses and sovereign lands are
classified as either continent, island, or country, Australia is considered all
three. Typically, it is unique in this.
The second confusing thing about Australia are the
animals. They can be divided into three categories: Poisonous, Odd, and Sheep. It is
true that of the 10 most poisonous arachnids on the planet, Australia has 9
of them.
Actually, it would be more accurate to say that of the 9 most
poisonous arachnids, Australia has all of them. However, there are curiously
few snakes, (though those that are there are usually deadly) possibly
because the spiders have killed them all. But even the spiders won't go
near the sea.

Any visitors should be careful to check inside boots (before
putting them on) under toilet seats (before sitting down) and generally
everywhere else. A stick is very useful for this task. Strangely, it tends to
be the second class of animals (the Odd) that are more dangerous. The
creature that kills the most people each year is the common Wombat. It is nearly
as ridiculous as its name, and spends its life digging holes in the
ground, in which it hides. During the night it comes out to eat worms and
grubs.
The wombat kills people in two ways: First, the animal is
indestructible.Digging holes in the hard Australian clay builds muscles that
outclass Olympic weightlifters. At night, they often wander the roads.
Semi-trailers (Road Trains) have hit them at high speed, with all 9 wheels on one
side, and this merely makes them very annoyed. They express this by
snorting, glaring, and walking away. Alas, to smaller cars, the wombat
becomes an asymmetrical launching pad, with results that can be imagined, but
not adequately described.
The second way the wombat kills people relates to its
burrowing behavior. If a person happens to put their hand down a Wombat hole, the
Wombat will feel the disturbance and think ""Ho! My hole is collapsing!"" at
which it will brace its muscled legs and push up against the roof of its burrow
with incredible force, to prevent its collapse. Any unfortunate hand
will be crushed, and attempts to withdraw will cause the Wombat to simply
bear down harder. The unfortunate will then bleed to death through their
crushed hand as the wombat prevents him from seeking assistance. This is
considered the third most embarrassing known way to die, and Australians don't
talk about it much.

   At this point, we would like to mention the Platypus, estranged
   relative of
   the mammal, which has a duck-bill, otter's tail, webbed feet, lays
   eggs,
   detects its aquatic prey in the same way as the electric eel, and
   has
   venomous barbs attached to its hind legs, thus combining all
   'typical'
   Australian attributes into a single improbable creature.
    The last confusing thing about Australia is the
   inhabitants. First,
   a short history: Some time around 40,000 years ago, some people
   arrived in
   boats from the north. They ate all the available food, and lot of
   them died.
   The ones that survived learned respect for the balance of nature,
   man's
   proper place in the scheme of things, and spiders. They settled in,
   and
   spent a lot of the intervening time making up strange stories.
   Then,
   around
   200 years ago, Europeans arrived in boats from the north. More
   accurately,
   European convicts were sent, with a few deranged and stupid people
   in
   charge. They tried to plant their crops in Autumn (failing to take
   account
   of the reversal of the seasons when moving from the top half of the
   planet
   to the bottom), ate all their food, and a lot of them died. About
   then the
   sheep arrived in boats from the north, and have been treasured ever
   since.
   It is interesting to note here that the Europeans always consider
   themselves
   vastly superior to any other race they encounter, since they can
   lie,
   cheat,
   steal, and litigate (marks of a civilized culture they say) -
   whereas
   all
   the Aboriginals can do is happily survive being left in the middle
   of
   a vast
   red-hot desert, equipped with a stick. Eventually, the new lot of
   people
   stopped being Europeans on Extended Holiday and became Australians.
   The
   changes are subtle, but deep, caused by the mind-stretching
   expanses
   of
   nothingness and eerie quiet, where a person can sit perfectly still
   and look
   deep inside themselves to the core of their essence, their reasons
   for
   being, and the necessity of checking inside your boots every
   morning
   for
   fatal surprises.
    They also picked up the most finely tuned sense of
   irony in the
   world, and the Aboriginal gift for making up stories. Be warned.
   There is
   also the matter of the beaches. Australian beaches are simply the
   nicest and
   best in the entire world. Although anyone actually venturing into
   the
   sea
   will have to contend with sharks, stinging jellyfish, stonefish (a
   fish
   which sits on the bottom of the sea, pretends to be a rock, and has
   venomous
   barbs sticking out of its back that will kill just from the pain)
   and
   surf-boarders. However, watching a beach sunset is worth the risk.
    As a result of all this hardship, dirt, thirst, and
   wombats, you
   would expect Australians to be a dour lot. Instead, they are
   genial,
   jolly,
   cheerful, and always willing to share a kind word with a stranger,
   unless
   they are an American. Faced with insurmountable odds and impossible
   problems, they smile disarmingly and look for a stick.
   Major engineering feats have been performed with sheets of
   corrugated
   iron,
   string, and mud. Alone of all the races on earth, they seem to be
   free from
   the 'Grass is Greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome, and
   roundly
   proclaim that Australia is, in fact, the other side of that fence.
   They call
   the land ""Oz"", ""Godzone"" (a verbal contraction of ""God's Own
   Country"") and
   ""Best bloody place on earth, bar none, strewth."" The irritating
   thing
   about
   this is they may be right.
   There are some traps for the unsuspecting traveler, though. Do
   not under any circumstances suggest that the beer is imperfect,
   unless you
   are comparing it to another kind of Australian beer. Do not wear a
   Hawaiian
   shirt. Religion and Politics are safe topics of conversation
   (Australians
   don't care too much about either) but Sport is a minefield. The
   only
   correct
   answer to ""So, howdya' like our country, eh?"" is ""Best {insert your
   own
   regional swear word here} country in the world!"". It is very likely
   that, on
   arriving, some cheerful Australians will 'adopt' you, and on your
   first
   night, take you to a pub where Australian Beer is served. Despite
   the
   obvious danger, do not refuse. It is a form of initiation rite. You
   will
   wake up late the next day with an astonishing hangover, a
   foul-taste
   in your
   mouth, and wearing strange clothes. Your hosts will usually make
   sure
   you
   get home, and waive off any legal difficulties with ""It's his first
   time in
   Australia, so we took him to the pub."", to which the policeman will
   sagely
   nod and close his notebook. Be sure to tell the story of these
   events
   to
   every other Australian you encounter, adding new embellishments at
   every
   stage, and noting how strong the beer was. Thus you will be
   accepted
   into
   this unique culture.
   Most Australians are now urban dwellers, having discovered the
   primary use
   of electricity, which is air-conditioning and refrigerators.
    Typical Australian sayings:
    ""G'Day!""
    ""It's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.""
    ""She'll be right.""
    ""And down from Kosciusko, where the pine clad ridges
   raise their
   torn and
   rugged battlements on high, where the air is clear is crystal, and
   the white
   stars fairly blaze at midnight in the cold and frosty sky. And
   where,
   around
   the overflow, the reed beds sweep and sway to the breezes, and the
   rolling
   plains are wide. The Man from Snowy River is a household word
   today,
   and the
   stock-men tell the story of his ride.""
   
    Tips to Surviving Australia:
    Don't ever put your hand down a hole for any reason
   whatsoever. We
   mean
   it. The beer is stronger than you think, regardless of how strong
   you
   think
   it is.
    Always carry a stick.
    Air-conditioning.
    Do not attempt to use Australian slang, unless you are a
   trained
   linguist
   and good in a fistfight.
    Thick socks.
    Take good maps. Stopping to ask directions only works
   when there
   are
   people nearby.
    If you leave the urban areas, carry several liters of
   water with
   you at
   all times, or you will die.
    Even in the most embellished stories told by Australians,
   there is
   always
   a core of truth that it is unwise to ignore.

Mere days after his 21st birthday, a sign appeared at the local bar “Bouncer wanted.” What luck! At this point William looked the part the part and more. His training had paid dividends in a big way: he was 6’3”, 250 lbs, with what couldn’t be more than an ounce of body fat on his entire frame.

William rushed home, got his resumé, and told his brother the exciting news “Today is finally the day, brother! I’m going to be a bouncer!” Excited to see William’s dream come true, his brother followed him to what they both thought would be a slam dunk interview which would result with William being hired immediately. 

They arrive at the bar and his brother waits outside as William confidently takes his first steps into his future work place. But wait...

Almost as fast as William had walked in, he dejectedly walked out of the very same bar. “I... I... I just don’t understand...” William uttered quietly as he walked back home.

William’s brother, puzzled, still stands outside the bar racking his brain about what could have possibly happened. He walks into the bar and still sees the “Bouncer wanted” sign. Still confused, William’s brother asks the bartender what happened to the big guy that just left. The bartender replies “I don’t know. The guy didn’t say a word. He walked in, looked around, and left without so much as a peep.”

The brother decides to buy a drink as he ponders this situation. “One beer, please!” As he reaches for payment, he realizes he only has a $50 bill. “Can you break this?” The brother asks. The bartender simply shakes his head and points to the only other sign in the bar:

Now before I tell you why this should be of concern to you that the literal beings that make the world function are DYING... let me explain to you why crackheads are a fundamental part of society.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Crackheads go through a lot to be crackheads. They are often restless because crack. They are often irresponsible.. because crack. And they walk around a lot with burned fingers.. because crack.
2. Crackheads provide us with happiness. Everyday there is a new invention, a new dance move. A new viral video of a crackhead doing crackhead things with their crackhead friends.

but you know what crackheads also provide us with everyday? A new way to survive death. Now this is why I am confused.

&amp;#x200B;

***The crackheads are dying***

And this is ridiculous. Why? Because crackheads don't die. Remember the last time you saw a crackhead jump off a building and... *not* survive? Jump out of a moving car and just.. die? The answer is you haven't. Why? Because neighborhood crackheads are immortal. So now, I ask you why all of a sudden, the sweet, gentle neighborhood crackheads are just **dying**? Well I have the answer. It's the government meddling once again. They refuse to let the superior race grow and spread the lifestyle of crackheadenism. This is because being a crackhead frees you from the trauma and limitations of everyday society. Being a crackhead frees you from death. Being a crackhead frees you from poverty. But most importantly.. being   a crackhead lets you control animals like Cinderella and Snow White. The government knows this. And this is why they want to eradicate all crackheads. So savor your neighborhood crackhead. And when they go missing.. don't say I didn't warn you.",Where Have All The Crackheads Gone???,1

During the sermon, he asked the children if they knew what resurrection was. Now, asking questions during children's sermons is crucial, but at the same time, asking children questions in front of a congregation can also be very dangerous. Having asked the children if they knew the meaning of resurrection, a little boy raised his hand, the pastor called on him and the little boy said, ""I know that if you have a resurrection that lasts more than four hours you are supposed to call the doctor."" It took over ten minutes for the congregation to settle down enough for the service to continue.",This is what happens when your child is exposed to too many TV commercials,3

 ক্লাসে গ্রুপ ফটো দেখার সময় শিক্ষক বাচ্চাদের বলল-
   
 শিক্ষক : যখন তোমরা বড় হবে; তখন এই ফটো দেখে বলবে- এটা রাজু, ও আমেরিকা চলে গেছে। এটা গলু, ও লন্ডন চলে গেছে। এটা শিউলি, ব্রিটেনের এক সম্ভ্রান্ত পরিবারে ওর বিয়ে হয়েছে। আর এটা সেই স্টুপিড পাপ্পু, যেখানে ছিল, সেখানেই রয়ে গেছে।
   
 পাপ্পু : আর এটাও বলবো, এটা আমাদের শিক্ষক, যে পরলোকে চলে গেছে।

Schmitt had been single since the day he was born, so it was to his frustration when his previous lab partner, Martin, was no longer single.  After another subtle round of boasting (or so Schmitt thought), Schmitt decided to ask for help.

“Come to think of it,” said Schmitt, “your dating techniques sure are good!”

Martin shrugged. “It takes practice.”

“Could you like, give me a practical demonstration?” asked Schmitt.

“You’ve forgotten?” Martin shook his head. “Fine, head over to the lab tonight. I’ll teach you again.”

Overjoyed, Schmitt downed a few more cups, before swaggering away. Once at home, he took a shower, shaved, combed his hair and did everything else a teenager bristling with hormones would do on his first date. When he was done, he hailed a cab and made for the lab, where he used to work. 

The security guard waved him through. As an ex-worker at Acme Labs, Schmitt was still fresh in the guard’s memory. It didn’t take long before he was through. Schmitt strolled over to Martin’s workplace, where the latter was dressed rather shabbily.

“Casual?” asked Schmitt. Schmitt assessed his attire again — was it too formal?

“What were you expecting? Come on, hurry up, I’ve a date in an hour,” replied Martin. “Why the hell are you wearing a suit anyway?”

“You know…”

“Whatever. Let’s go, the equipment’s at the back,” said Martin, cutting off Schmitt’s words. It didn’t take long before the duo was fumbling around with Geiger counters and other bits of equipment. After an hour, Schmitt was pissed.

“Look,” said Schmitt, “weren’t you going to teach me?”

“I am, aren’t I?” replied Martin, his hand holding a radiation counter. “Dating techniques, right?”",Dating techniques,2

As he has no idea where he is, he asks the person in front of him, an elderly nun: „Dear sister, where am I? What happened? Am I dead?“ The nun turns around, smiles knowingly and says: „Yes, you’re dead and so am I. At the end of the queue Saint Peter will judge your life and if you‘re worthy, you may go through the golden gate and stay in heaven. Otherwise,...“ She doesn‘t finish the sentence but points to the ground.

Suddenly the redneck becomes very nervous. As he speaks, his voice almost cracks: „Oh no! You know, I‘ve always been a good Christian. I went to church every Sunday, loved my family and I’ve never meant no harm to nobody. But I‘ve also been a moonshiner. I often sold the liqueur I made, but one time the booze was impure and killed a man. Dear sister, I‘m scared I won‘t make it into heaven because of this mistake. Please let me hide under your robe until we pass the gate.“

As the nuns order has always taught to help people in need, she agrees. The redneck hides under her robe and after half an hour they finally enter heaven through the golden gate. As the redneck crawls out of his hiding place a few minutes later, the nun grumbles: „You told me you’ve sold liqueur, not that you were one.“",A redneck dies and goes to heaven.,2

Resolved to find her something that would occupy her time and satisfy her until he could return home, the man went into a nearby sex store and asked about martial aids for his wife. After being shown toy after toy, he said that he didn't think any of them would do the trick. He told the shop owner he needed something special. 

The shop owner showed him more expensive toys and creams, but the soldier turned them all down. He outlined his problem to the owner and with a knowing look in his eye he told the soldier that he may have exactly what he needed. He warned the soldier that what he was about to show him was far beyond anything he had ever seen before and it was the only one in existence that he knew of. 

The soldier, intrigued, asked to see what the shop owner had. Pulling a wooden box from under the counter, the man said that his solution was magic. The owner pulled the box top off with a flourish to reveal what appeared to be an average-sized didlo. Shaking his head, the soldier said that he didn't think this plain toy would be the thing that kept his wife away from other men. 

""Ah but that's where the magic comes in,"" said the store owner.""You simply say 'O Dick' and what you want it to fuck and and it will. ""

Confused, the soldier considered the possibility for a moment. Slowly, he said ""and I'm betting that a magical dildo would fetch a high price, it being the only one in existence and all.""

The shop owner was not phased and offered the soldier a deal. He encouraged the young man to write a check out to him dated for whenever he would return home. If O Dick had failed him, he could simply stop the check or return the dildo if he found it indeed had no magical properties. With a wink, the shop owner said ""but I don't think your wife will let you return it. And really, what is the cost of her loyalty?""

Happy with the deal, the soldier made his way home with the package. Later that night, he showed his wife what he had bought and relayed the entire conversation to her. Skeptically, the wife accepted the gift and vowed that she would use it to remain loyal to him if she had urges while he was away. 

The next week, the soldier left. A week after that, the wife's lonliness began to become too much to bear. Remembering her promise to her husband, she went to the closet and got out the box that sheltered O Dick. Feeling a little silly, she undressed and laid the dildo on the bed. After a few moments, she said ""O Dick my pussy.""

As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the dildo flew into her and pleasured her in a way no other toy had. After multiple orgasms, she began to feel tired. She said ""O Dick stop."" But nothing happened. 

Frantically, the wife shouted out a number of commands, none of which O Dick followed. Beginning to become afraid, the wife decided that her best bet was to go to the hospital. As embarrassing as the situation was, she didn't know how to deal with an enchanted object and hoped someone else would. 

Dressing as well as she could in loose shorts as O Dick continued its pleasant assault, the wife managed to hobble out to her car. Once on the road, driving well over the speed limit, she passed through stop signs and red lights. Luck was on her side as she only received angry honks and the screeching of tires as other cars swerved to avoid her. 

Then she saw lights behind her twinkling blue and red. Knowing she would be in more trouble if she didn't stop, the wife pulled over onto the shoulder. A tall, gruff officer approached her window. Obviously angry, he asked what she thought she was doing. The wife looked pleadingly at the officer and took a big breath. She told him everything. What her husband had told her, the magical dildo, how she was trying so hard to stay faithful, and the predicament that sent her rushing to the ER. 

With a tight look on his face, the officer sighed. Knowing he didn't believe her, the wife felt like she might cry. The officer looked her straight in the eye and said sarcastically, ""O Dick my ass.""","O Dick NSFW, Long",23

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.

 

&amp;#x200B;

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

&amp;#x200B;

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,1

It’s not some futuristic thingamajig, or something stupid like that. It’s just a different version of a very common item. The answer to the question is the punchline. If the person being asked knows the punchline, the teller finds it funny because of how hard it is to guess what this simple thing is. And if they don’t know(which no one has so far) they laugh when they find out what it is because they’re usually way off, at least the people i’ve asked.

He then passed by the lake and heard a croak, but again, he knew it was fake and moved on.

After that, believe it or not, but a meteor fell from the sky, right in front of his house. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, so he went and investigated. He heard a croak from the crater, and this time he was sure it was real. He went into the crater, dig through the commet, and lo and behold, a frog was trapped in there.

Joe was amazed that he was able to distinguish between the fake croaks and the real one, so he asked Billy,

“How did you know that one was real?”

“Easy” Billy replies. “The real croak is always in the commets”",Two friends were playing a game,6

As the sun is setting, Satan is guiding the man through a lovely little neighborhood. After a few minutes of walk, he stops at an incredible villa.
„This is yours, man. Have a good night. But whatever you do...“ he points at a gigantic wall in the distance...“do NOT look behind it. See you tomorrow!“

Lying in his bed, the man wonders, what’s behind the wall. Being ever so curious, he decides to walk to the wall.
Arriving there, he sees a red light emitted from behind it. He spots a small hole in the wall and decides, against Satan’s words, to look through it.
To his horror, he sees a blazing wasteland. Everywhere are tormented souls, screaming in agony, demons picking them apart.
Horrified, he runs back to his villa and hides under his blankets. Suddenly, he hears the doorbell.
Carefully he opens his door to see Satan in front of him.

So to resolve the issue, God enacted a new rule. In order to be allowed into Heaven; you had to be pure of heart and had to have had a bad day when you died. The first day this rule was implemented, three men showed up at the Pearly Gates each one almost instantly after the other. Remembering this new rule, Saint Peter said to the men, ""Come forth and tell me, how was your day?""

The first man stepped forward and said, ""Oh man, I had an awful day! I had been suspecting my wife of cheating on me for several months now but I could never catch her in the act. Then today I had a hunch to go home unexpectedly during lunch and try to catch her off guard. I opened the door to my apartment on the 24th floor and found my wife on the couch drenched in sweat and half naked; frantic with guilt in her eyes. I tore that place apart head to toe looking for the son of a bitch, but could find no trace of him. Just when I was about to give up and apologize to my wife for my behavior, I noticed the bastard was hanging naked from the railing of my balcony. I ran over to the balcony and stomped his fingers until he fell, but he was lucky enough to land in some bushes and survive. So in one final act of rage I ran to the kitchen and lifted the fridge over my head, stepped to the balcony, and tossed it down onto the man before I suddenly died of a heart attack."" Saint Peter felt the man had met the requirements and let the man into heaven.

The second man then stepped forward and said, ""By far the WORST day of my life! I recently lost everything in the stock market, my wife divorced me, and to top it all off I just found out I have brain cancer. I decided to go for a run to clear my head and when I got home to my apartment on the 25th floor I decided to take a shower. I stepped out on the balcony to get some fresh air in nothing but my towel around my waist. I leaned over the railing to get a good look at the view and slipped over the edge. Luckily I caught myself on the railing of the floor below me. But just then out of nowhere some crazy bastard ran up and stomped my fingers and then through a fucking fridge on me!"" ""Wow"" said Saint Peter, ""That is one bad day if I've ever heard one, go right in sir.""

By now Saint Peter had notice the third man had been snickering and holding back laughter. ""What's so funny?"" he asked the man. The third man then stepped forward and barely able to contain his laughter said, ""Okay, so I've been having an affair with some dude's wife and he comes home early, so I was hiding buck naked in the fridge....""",A New Rule In Heaven (LONG),1

The old man insists and the Vicar is duly brought. The old man is close to death by the time he arrives. Then he says 

""Hello, I'd like to convert. I've been a Catholic all my life but I'd like to become a Protestant before I die""

His son is now quite worried -

 ""But father, you've been a Catholic for 93 years, you can't convert now as you die""

The man insists its what he wants to do, and again the son questions him: 

""Why dad, why? Why would you turn back on your faith and become a Protestant as you lie here dying, soon to meet the Lord?""

 Students in an advanced Biology class were taking their mid-term exam. The last question was, 'Name seven advantages of Mother's Milk'.

The question was worth 70 points or none at all. One student, in particular, was hard put to think of seven advantages.

However, he wrote:

1) It is perfect formula for the child.
2) It provides immunity against several diseases.
3) It is always the right temperature.
4) It is inexpensive.
5) It bonds the child to mother, and vice versa.
6) It is always available as needed.

And then the student was stuck.

Finally, in desperation, just before the bell rang indicating the end of the test, he wrote:

7) It comes in two attractive containers and it's high enough off the ground where the cat can't get it.

She was the most beautiful girl in the country, with a skin white as snow and lips red as blood. She had an evil stepmom however that couldn't bear that there was a more beautiful girl and she banned Snow White to the forests.

Snow White endlessly dwelled through the woods until she encountered a small cute house. She knocked on the door, but no one answered the door. She was hungry and tired and needed a place to stay so she entered. Inside no one was home, but there where 7 little beds and a pan of hot soup. She ate some soup and fell in a deep sleep. After some time she woke up to curious voices around her bed. When she opened her eyes she saw 7 Black Dwarfs. She explained the whole situation, the dwarfs understood completely and offered her to stay for as long as needed.

It didn't take long for Snow White to become one of the boys and it seemed like it had been like this forever. One day Snow White and the 7 Black Dwarfs where out in the woods. They where fooling around: tagging eachother, chasing rabbits, when Snow White jumped over a wooden log WHAM!! into a bear trap, cutting of both legs clean at the thighs. She called for help, but only one of the youngest of dwarfs heard her. He rushed to her and found her bleeding heavily. ""Oh my God this is terrible!!"" he said ""We have to get you to a hospital immediately!"". Snow White looked to her limps and said ""Dopey, I'm not going to make it, I'm bleeding heavily and the hospital is too far away. If anything, I have one last request. I'm a virgin, but I don't want to die without knowing what true love is. Will you please take my virginity?"" Dopey said ""No, that is.. I can get a doctor here asap, we must-"" ""Dopey, I feel life is slipping away, please, I beg you..."" Dopey saw that she was right and after some doubt he decided to grant her her last wish. In the most delicate way possible he made love to her, speaking calming words. She orgasmed and in her last breath she thanked him, and perished on the spot. Dopey lay down his head when he felt someone tapping his shoulder. He turned his head and looked right into the double barrel shotgun of the Hunter. Well, good luck explaining that!!",Anyone heard the tale of Snowwhite and the 7 Black Dwarfs? [NSFW],0

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man who drove trains for a living.,11
