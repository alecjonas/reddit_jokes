**Mom:** You want answers?!

**Me:** I want the truth!

**Mom:** YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!... Son, we live in a house that has walls and those walls concentrate the gases produced by your intolerance to lactose. Who's gonna deal with that smell?! You?! You, my delicate husband?! I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for the cheese and you curse Domino's. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That this pizza without cheese, while tastes tragic, probably spared our noses! And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, spared our noses! You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me with that deodorant, you need me with that deodorant. We use words like clean, neat, fragrance. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent cleaning something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very cleaning that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way, Otherwise, I suggest you pick up an air freshener, and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to.

It won't go away, but he has a parade to go to that morning! So he steps onto his Holy Balcony, slips out of his Holy Pyjamas, and does what most people do when they have an erection they want to get rid of.

That's masturbate, by the way.

Anyway, job well done, he heads back inside and robes-up ready for the parade. 

He's walking along, blessing people and all that shit, when some guy comes up to him with a camera. Tapping the camera with his index finger, he says to the pope, ""This morning, 8am, on the balcony. I think you know what I'm talking about. $100,000 and I'll give you the camera. It's a 2003 model, no Wi-Fi. The pictures are on here and nowhere else.""

The pope, shaking with fear and embarrassed by his stupidity, whips out his Holy Wallet and gives the man the cash. If you think it's unrealistic that the pope would carry this much money, please stop over-analyzing, it's just a joke.

Anyway, with the blackmailer paid off, the pope finishes the parade and heads back home. On his way back into the Vatican, the high priest notices the camera. ""Hey, that's a pretty retro camera! How much did you pay for that?""

""$100,000,"" replies the pope, dejectedly. 

""Wow!"", says the high priest, ""He certainly saw you coming!""",One day the pope wakes up with an erection,113

The old timer said, ""He's 100 years old and he hunted turkey with me this morning, and that's why he's still alive...he's a turkey hunter.""

The doctor said, ""You mean you're 80 years old and your grandfather's still living! How old is he?""

The doctor was getting frustrated at this point and said, ""I guess he went turkey hunting with you this morning too?""

The old timer said, ""No, Grandpa couldn't go this morning because he got married.""

The Doctor said in amazement, ""Got married!! Why would a 118-year-old guy want to get married?""

She noticed the guy always comes mostly in the evenings and weekends.
The guy never tried to talk to her nor showed any gesture, he just moves here and there by looking into his mobile phone and occasionally stealing a stare at her.
It went on like that for a year and the girl understood the guy was in love with her but was too shy to express his feelings. 
So, she told her parents. 
They too saw him and liked him. 
They discussed with her grandparents about a likely marriage. 
But wanted her to make the first move.
The next day, she went to him and said, Hi. I'm Jada.
He said, Hi. I'm Smith.
Hearing this, the girl was very happy as the names were matching like Will Smith and Jada Pinkett.
The girl went on and said, I really appreciate your patience and decency. 
You have been standing in front of my home everyday for about a year now. 
So, I understand that you are in love with me but too shy to say it. 
I think i really like you too and would love it if we get married.
The guy smiled and said, Forgive me sister! Actually your home's WIFI doesn't have a password. So, i come here every evening after work to use free wi-fi to chat with my girlfriend.",A girl started noticing a guy who stands in front of her home everyday in the evening.,1

post,7edvnv,2qh72,jokes,false,1511226161,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7edvnv/rnews_reminded_me_of_this_joke/,self.jokes,,"A man is visiting Spain for the first time. While dining out one night, he watches as a phalanx of waiters delivers a domed platter to the table next to his. There's much ceremony and fuss and he's very intrigued. He asks his own waiter what's going on. 

""Señor, he has ordered The Trophy.""

""What's that?""

At that moment the dome is lifted to show a large chunk of meat steaming on the platter. 

""Señor, it is custom for the victor to devour the balls of his opponent after a bull fight. That man is a matador and he defeated that bull today.""

The man at the other table sliced into and took a bite of the meat. The entire restaurant applauded. The tourist knew he had to do this, too.

It took a lot of finagling because he wasn't a matador, but eventually be got his name on a wait list. 

Long after his vacation had ended he got a email from the restaurant. His name was at the top of the list and his reservation was set for the following week. Hurriedly he made his arrangements and flew back to Spain. 

As he sat in the restaurant he could hardly contain his excitement. So few people got to try this dish! He'd waited so long and finally, he too would have his Trophy! The waiters poured out of the kitchen, the domed platter held aloft. Everyone was watching him as the platter was set before him, the entire restaurant still with anticipation. 

With a flourish, the head waiter removed the domed lid to reveal--

-- a tiny lump of meat. 

The man was confused and demanded to know why this portion was so much smaller than what he'd seen before. Why was his Trophy a piddling little piece of meat?!

The head waiter smiled at him sympathetically. 

""Sometimes, señor, the bull does not lose.""",R/news reminded me of this joke.,1

""One Australian SAS soldier is better than ten Taliban"".

The Taliban commander quickly sends 10 of his best soldiers over the dune whereupon a gun-battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then silence. The voice then calls out 

""One Australian SAS soldier is better than one hundred Taliban"".

Furious, the Taliban commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune and instantly a huge gunfight commences. After 10 minutes of battle, again silence. The Australian voice calls out again 

""One Australian SAS soldier is better than one thousand Taliban"".

The enraged Taliban Commander musters one thousand fighters and sends them across the dune. Cannons, rockets, and machine gun fire ring out as a huge battle is fought. Then silence. Eventually one wounded Taliban fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his commander, 

""Don't send any more men, it's a trap, ...

There's actually two of them.""",[Long] Australian SAS,55

When I was 18, I got a boyfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate guy with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate guy, but he was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, he was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a guy with stability.

When I was 22, I found a very stable guy but he was boring. He was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided I needed a guy with some excitement.

When I was 25, I found an exciting guy, but I couldn't keep up with him.
He rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. He did mad, impetuous things and flirted with everyone he met. He made me miserable as often as happy. He was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a guy with some ambition.

When I turned 28, I found a smart ambitious guy with his feet planted firmly on the ground and married him. He was so ambitious that he divorced me, took everything I owned, and ran off with my best friend.

I am now 32 and am looking for a guy with a big DICK 😁",What women want...,2

 An old man had lived all his life in the Florida Keys and is on his deathbed and knows the end is near.

 His nurse, his wife, his daughter and two sons, are with him.

 He asks for two witnesses to be present and a camcorder be in place to record his last wishes,

 and when all is ready he begins to speak:

 ""My son, Bernie, I want you to take the Ocean Reef houses.""

 ""My daughter Sybil, you take the apartments between mile markers 100 and Tavernier.""

 ""My son, Jamie, I want you to take the offices over in the Marathon Government Center.""

 ""Sarah, my dear wife, please take all the residential buildings on the bay side of Blackwater Sound.""

 The nurse and witnesses are blown away as they did not realize his extensive holdings,

 and as he slips away, the nurse says,

 ""Mraam, your husband must have been such a hard-working man to have accumulated all 

 this property.""

 The wife replies, “He had a paper route!""",Old Man,77

He moves to strike the father his hand opens up to caress instead of strike.

He opens his mouth to cuss at the mother and instead finds he has expressed his love instead.

After sometime God appears and speaks to the couple. Heaven is all perfect for them.

She whispers ""The box jellyfish has 24 eyes, and a lifespan of less than one year"" to Peter and tells him to pass the message on. As she watched the message being passed on, she noted the subtle look of enlightenment in each of the students and looked for any notable changes.

She paid close attention and the first notable difference came when Janet whispered to Brad. Brad seemed to have absolutely no reaction, but this did not come as much of a surprise to Miss Davies, as Brad was the class idiot with a permanent dumb look on his face, but he was still popular due to being easy on the eyes and good at football. 

Brad passed the message on to Sandra, who began to smile and blush. This was an unusual reaction and Miss Davies suspected that Brad was likely the first to mishear the message, which was no surprise either. Brad egged her on to pass the message, and she calmed down and casually whispered to Pauline, who giggled. 

Miss Davies noticed that at this point there was an unusual pattern of reactions coming from students as the message was passed on. Some students blushed, some laughed, and some even got angry. Miss Davies had never seen so much discrepancy and thought the message must be changing rapidly. As the message got closer and closer to Miss Davies, she noticed most of the previous students were now whispering to one another and giggling.

Finally the message got to the last student, Stuart. Stuart was blushing and highly reluctant to relay the message to his teacher at this point, but Miss Davies insisted ""It's fine, Stuart. I'm sure the message is completely different and sounds like nonsense by now."" Stuart swallowed hard and spoke up.

""How about a blowjob after class? I'm fuckin' horny.""

Janet blushed.

PRIEST AND RABBI



 

 

 

 

Priest and a Rabbi

 

A priest and a rabbi were sitting next to each other on an airplane.

After a while, the priest turned to the rabbi and asked,

 

Is it still a requirement of your faith that you not eat pork?

The rabbi responded, Yes, that is still one of our laws.

 

The priest then asked, Have you ever eaten pork?

To which the rabbi replied,

 

Yes, on one occasion I did succumb to temptation and tasted a ham

sandwich.

 

The priest nodded in understanding and went on with his reading.

A while later, the rabbi spoke up and asked the priest,

 

""Father, is it still a requirement of your church that you remain celibate? ""

The priest replied, ""Yes, that is still very much a part of our faith""

 

The rabbi then asked him,

""Father, have you ever fallen to the temptations of the flesh?""

The priest replied,

 

""Yes, rabbi, on one occasion I was weak and broke my Faith.""

The rabbi nodded understandingly and remained silent, and sat

thinking, for

 

about five minutes.

 

Finally, the rabbi said,

 

""Beats the shit out of a ham sandwich, doesn't it?""

post,7e6by8,2qh72,jokes,false,1511152623,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7e6by8/the_monks_secret/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because 

""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different doors, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the blades of grass and sand pebbles exist on the earth.

He challenges the other two to throw their watch of the tower and to run down as fast as they can to try and catch it before it drops to the ground. Each of them puts in $100, so the first one to catch the watch wins and gets the $300 in total.

They hesitate but do give in after a while. The guy proposing the challenge says they can go first since he came up with it. 

The first one is readying himself to sprint down. He throws the watch and runs down like a mad man, only to arrive at the entrance of the tower and seeing his watch completely crushed. 

The second guy, eagered to not let the $300 slip, throws his watch very high up and almost flies downstairs. Upon reaching the entrance he sees his watch just drop on the ground in front of him. Though he is know convinced that it is pretty much impossible to catch the watch. 

The third guy also throws his watch down. He enjoys the view, so he decided to smoke a cigarette first. Slowly but surely he starts descending down. Before going to the entrance he calls his mom for a check-up, asking how dads doing etc. after the long phonecall he walks to the entrance of the tower, holding out his hand. The watch drops in the middle of his hand upon walking outside. The two guys are completely shocked. He gets the $300 and proceeds to light a cigarette. 

They still can't believe he actually did it. One of them dares to ask the question: ""How could you possibly catch it when you were A LOT slower then us? How in god's name did you do it?""

He says:""Pretty simple, I just set my watch 30 minutes earlier""

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having
sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't a fucking electric fence.""",Joke a friend sent me.,2669

He helps the woman up and walks her to the side of the road, when he sees it’s none other than Lola Bunny from Space Jam.

Lola Bunny says “You saved my life, I must repay you. Ask me anything, I will grant you any three requests you ask of me.”

Bill thinks about it. He’s pretty well-off, he’s a bit shy, something of a homebody—he can’t think of anything Lola Bunny could really give him. “Thank you for the offer, but it was really nothing. Let’s just call it even.”

Lola Bunny says no, no. “My honor demands that I repay you. Please, ask me anything. I’ll lick your boots clean if you want me to. I’ll clean your house. I’ll mow your lawn. Anything!”

Bill sees that Lola Bunny is serious and he thinks about it again. Finally he says “Lola Bunny, you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. If it’s not too much to ask, and as long as you’re comfortable with it, would it be okay if I kiss you?”

Lola Bunny puts her soft, warm hands on Bill’s face. Her fingers gently run through Bill’s hair. She coyly looks Bill in the eye with a lustful stare that makes Bill blush and look away, only for Lola Bunny to hold him firmly and keep up the searing eye contact. Slowly, Lola Bunny moves closer and closer. Her eyes close. Her lips part. Her mouth softly touches Bill’s in a kiss that’s first flirty and undemanding, but slowly grows more intense. Bill feels Lola Bunny’s hands running familiarly down his body, feels her tongue slip inside his mouth, and Bill is helplessly consumed by passion as the kiss grows into a full-body embrace.

Finally, Lola Bunny steps away, leaving Bill’s heart racing, his blood pounding, his lips tingling. He’s the most aroused he’s ever been!

“I hope that was alright,” Lola Bunny says. “Everyone knows I’m not much of a kisser. I hope I didn’t embarrass myself too badly. Now, please, is there anything else I can do to repay you? Anything at all? Just ask!”

Bill’s mouth is dry and a thought pops into his head. He feels like a pervert, but he has to ask. “I don’t want you to do anything you’re uncomfortable with, but what if you gave me a massage?”

Lola Bunny says okay and they go to a massage parlor, where the owner generously lets them use a room. First, Lola Bunny undresses Bill down. Then she eases Bill down onto the table and covers him with rich, creamy lotion. Bill can’t believe how strong Lola Bunny’s hands are as the woman nonetheless uses the most gentle of touches to work out every last kink in Bill’s body. It feels like it goes on for hours as Lola Bunny rubs down every inch of Bill’s body, until finally Bill feels like he’s just a warm puddle of water Lola Bunny is playing in.

“I hope that was alright,” Lola Bunny says when they’re finished and Bill has gotten dressed. “I’m really not much of a masseuse.”

Bill says it’s fine, that was the best massage he’s ever had, he feels like he could sleep for a thousand years.

Of course, Lola Bunny insists on doing her last favor for Bill.

Bill can’t think of anything, he tells Lola Bunny over and over again that she’s done more than enough, but Lola Bunny won’t hear of it. She demands that Bill give her some way to thank him for saving her life.

Finally, Bill says “Normally I would never ask this, but it’s been a really long time since I’ve been on a date and I would just like to hear something romantic so I can remember what it’s like. Do you think you could whisper something naughty in my ear?”

Lola Bunny wraps her arms around Bill. She purses her lips by Bill’s ear and whispers in her husky accent, first just talking about how cute he is and how she loves the way Bill is dressed, but then she starts telling Bill all the things she’d like to do to him in bed. Not only that, but she talks about wanting to have sex with Bill in public places, about wanting to bang him in a public restroom, or jerk him off while they’re stuck in traffic. Bill can’t believe all the dirty, kinky things Lola Bunny tells him. By the time she’s finished, Bill is practically on the verge of orgasm. 

Lola Bunny says “I hope that was alright, I get so awkward when it comes to sex, I should probably be thanking you not for laughing at me. You know what? I feel like I haven’t done anything to really thank you for saving my life. I kissed you, I gave you a backrub, I said a few dumb things about sex… tell you what. I’m going to do you a fourth favor. Please, ask me for something really big. I have to make this right between us.”

Bill thinks and thinks and thinks about it. He knows it’s not right, he knows he could be ruining the best day of his life, but he has to try. He says “Look, Lola, I’ve got nothing to do for the rest of the day. There’s a motel right over there. Why don’t we go rent a room, strip naked, and make mad passionate love all night long?”

Lola Bunny looks at him sorrowfully. “I’m sorry, Bill, I would like that too, but I can’t have sex outside of marriage. Please—is there anything else I can do for you?”

Suddenly, it hits Bill. He can’t believe he didn’t think of it sooner. He’s gotten three wishes granted by Lola Bunny already, and he almost went without getting the thing he should’ve asked for first!

“Lola Bunny,” he says confidently, and this joke doesn’t have a punchline, but I bet you really enjoyed thinking about screwing Lola Bunny, didn’t you, ya fucking furry?",Bill’s walking down the street one day when he sees a woman is about to be hit by a car,1

His whole life had been his livelihood, tilling the same soil that his father had, and his father before.  He had a way with the plants, especially with corn, and was especially proficient with the process of grinding the corn, which was immensely useful.  He was a self-proclaimed meal maker.

One day, while he was out inspecting his crop, he laid his delicate, almost lady-like hand upon an unripe ear that had been nibbled clean off.  His first thoughts drifted to the donkey farm of his short and fat distant neighbor.  Those asses were never to be trusted, certainly where there was a lot to grain.

After some introspection in his favorite thinking spot, where he could see to the lake, the old farmer concluded that he needed constant surveillance, in order to determine the culprit.  He purchased a Kiev camera setup based upon a recommendation from a friend, and erected the cameras at multiple locations around his field, ensuring a pipeline of information was at his disposal whenever he desired.

One night, while re-reading his favorite book, ‘The Mind of the Grind’, the old farmer was alerted to motion on one of his surveillance cameras.  At first, he thought it might be one of his workers, American of course, but there was no reason for them to be in the fields at this hour.  As the camera auto-focused on the multiple trespassers, the old farmer was baffled to see what appeared to be a few normal deer, but each of them had massive horns secured firmly to their heads.

Suddenly, it all fell in to place for the old farmer.  He shot up out of his seat with a yell:  “Fake Gnus!”

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop
and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a
doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.

The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.

She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled
back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.

Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and
the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.

The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor
laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his
bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.

She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me
and I didn't listen to you.

""What do you mean?"" asked his wife.

""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in.

""Oh tending to sheep is such a bore! I should be out on the field with the village guards fighting the orcs!"" he wailed.

Suddenly, a blinding white flash appeared among the boy's flock. And then, a bearded man with a jeweled staff appeared upon him, making the boy stagger backwards. ""Young boy! I cannot help but overhear your lamentations. Fortunately, I might know a solution to your problems.""

The shepherd was speechless. What was this man's intention and why was he offering to help him?""

""I am the feared and revered warlock from over yonder! I am D'jazgu!"" the wizard stated. ""I would like to offer you a proposal. In a far away land, a cave hidden from the world is waiting for you to discover. The cave holds treasures far greater than a kings and sought by many! However there stand in your way to your glory 7 seas and 7 high mountains. Do you still accept?""

Although unsettled by the long journey he will have to take, his temptation won over and Flayer accepted. He packed provisions and went on his journey.

When he reached the beach if the first ocean, he thought to make a sturdy raft to aid him through his journey on the waters. He sailed for weeks but finally reached the other end. He did so for the next 6 oceans he crossed, building a raft for each ocean.

Then at last, he encountered the vast slope of the mountains he will have to climb. And so, throught the snowy mountains he trekked. Although, he encounter many critters and creatures wanting to harm and eat him, he persevered.

And then at long last he reached the mouth of the cave that held the treasures and glory he was promised. However, when he shone his lamp through the opening he saw that the cave held people of extra ordinary strength and powers in cells. He recognized some of them from the stories he has been told. Achilles, Hercules, Artemis, Perseus, and even batman! He freed the heroes he saw, and they thanked him. As they flew or ran away from the cave he turned back. As he turned around, he saw that the elderly wizard D'jazgu was behind him.

""You lying bastard! You told me there were treasures and glory in this cave. There is only brave men and women in here! Why did you make me traverse to rough waters and trek through snowy mountains? Why did you mean to achieve?!"" Flayer asked tearfully.

""Oh young lad,"" The wizard replied,

post,7dzod3,2qh72,jokes,false,1511084784,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7dzod3/there_was_once_a_priest/,self.jokes,,"There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 kilometres from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard. With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

* Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. 

However, the priest was curious. He asked:

* Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

* Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. 

Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

* Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. 

It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

* Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

* Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 kilometres away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. 

On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

* Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

* Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. 

On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

* Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

* Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost caught the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckage. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. 

On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

* Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

* There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

* But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckage in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

* Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

* All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priest...,354

post,7dylhe,2qh72,jokes,false,1511068857,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7dylhe/there_was_this_tramp/,self.jokes,,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said 

""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.

In an attempt to quell her sexual appetite, he goes to a sex shop on the outskirts of town. He spends several minutes pouring over dozens of dildos, dongs, vibrators, and other toys. However, he knows that none of them will satisfy his wife for the entire duration of his trip. Defeated, he approaches the strange looking clerk and begins to explain his situation. The clerk reaches under the desk and pulls out a hand carved wooden box that is covered in ancient writing and symbols.
""This,"" explains the clerk, ""will serve your purpose.""  He opens the box to reveal a wooden phallus, darkened by age and covered in dust.
""Really?""
""Just watch"" says the clerk, and loudly speaks ""VOODOO DICK THE DOOR.""
Suddenly the artifact begins glowing and floats out of the box. It rockets across the room and starts attempting to penetrate the keyhole. The lights flicker as the walls begin to shake while the thing just goes to town on the keyhole. As a crack begins to run across the ceiling, the clerk shouts ""VOODOO HALT!"" and the magical dick floats gently back to the box.
""I'll take it"" says the businessman, already reaching for his credit card.
""A word of caution,"" begins the clerk, ""only the magic words can start or stop it's process. Nothing else will work.""
The man takes his gift home and presents it to his wife. He is so excited to tell her how to start it and what it does,, he neglects to tell her how to stop it. Even though she is skeptical she accepts the gift and the man departs.
After seven days the wife is getting extremely horny. She wants to remain faithful, but is already starting to fantasize about the neighbor and the pool boy. On day 10 she finally lets her sexual tension overcome her. Just as she is about to get some strange, she remembers the gift.  She figures it couldn't hurt to try it, even if she makes a fool of herself she is alone at home.  She strips and lays down, opening the box.
""Voodoo dick my pussy"" she says, almost sarcastically. Suddenly, the Voodoo dick flies straight to her crotch and begins intensely pleasuring her. It goes the exact right speed and angle. It is the best sex she has ever had. Two orgasms quickly turns to six, and there is no sign of stopping. She tries to stop it; grab it, but nothing hinders its mission. After fruitless internet research and four more orgasms she determines that the only remaining option is to go to the hospital. She can barely stay on her feet as she puts on her clothes and attempts to walk to the car. While driving, she has another orgasm, causing her to swerve and nearly hit a sign. A cop sees her car swerve and pulls her over.  She stops, and as he approaches the window she begins to explain. ""I'm so sorry officer,"" she says, trembling in pleasure, ""but I can barely drive because I have this Voodoo dick pounding away at my pussy...""
The officer rolls his eyes and replies ""Voodoo dick my ass!""",A businessman is going out of town for 3 weeks...,188

""Excuse me. Are you Jewish?"" she asks.

""Uh, no. I'm not Jewish."" He answers, slightly miffed by the strange question.

Apparently satisfied with his answer, she returns to her seat.

About ten minutes later, she returns.

""I'm sorry, but are you *sure* you're not Jewish?"" she asks, peering over his newspaper.

Still confused, he answers over his folded newspaper, ""Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm not Jewish.""

Two middle-aged men, Jones and Lockwood, are working as space traffic officers. As with many officers, the two men are partners, and they make a great team. Lockwood has worked as an officer for over thirty years, but went blind in his forties; Jones has less experience under his belt, but he has a keen eye and he’s quick with a joke. Together, they patrol the ‘streets’ of a small, interplanetary town floating between Earth and Mars.

One day, the two officers are dispatched to handle a nearby three-ship collision. Arriving at the scene, Jones examines the crash site; the three ships are mangled together in a disturbing ball of crushed metal, slowly drifting through space. Two of the ships' fuel vats have completely exploded. It’s clear that all three vessels depressurized in the crash, and no one survived. Jones spots an instant-messenger-screen floating in one of the ships; one of the drivers was cord-dinging (the future equivalent of texting) while flying.

Lockwood turns to Jones and asks, “What does it look like out there? Can you see how the crash happened?”

Jones, voice unsteady, replies, “Three different ship models were involved in the crash: a Tousmal-45, an elite E-WAY-B, and a faulty Thubbi-16. The Tousmal pulled out right in front of the Thubbi, which crashed into it without time to stop. The E-WAY-B was just behind the Thubbi; it drove straight into the crash. They were driving so quickly that they punctured all three ships, and they all depressurized. No survivors.”

“Damn.” Lockwood, upon hearing about the destruction, is visibly upset. He responds, “In all my years of patrolling, I almost never heard of a crash this bad. We train our drivers well; people are usually more careful than this.”

Jones grimaces. “I know, but… it looks like one of the drivers was cord-dinging while flying; I can see the message screen. Someone wasn’t paying attention to the route, and… well, this disaster happened.”

Lockwood is disturbed by the tragedy of the crash; all these lives were lost over something as pointless as a cord-ding message. Shaken and irate, he asks, “Could you fetch the message screen and read me the chat log? I… I need to know what message was more important than all of these people’s lives.”

Jones obliged. He donned a space suit, left the ship, and salvaged the message screen from the wreckage of the E-WAY-B. Once he returned to the police ship, he sat down and began to read the chat log:

&gt;“A CORD DING  
To: AL NOAN

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing.

He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out ""Oh God, help me!"" Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to now count you as a believer""?

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian""?
""Very well,"" said the voice. The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed. The bear dropped lowered his head, brought both paws together and spoke:
""Lord, please bless this food I am about to receive...""",An atheist was taking a walk through the woods...,6
