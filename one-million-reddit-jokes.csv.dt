&amp;#x200B;

A man and woman have just gotten married and on their wedding night while about to have sex the wife tells her new husband that it will cost him 20 bucks to have sex with her.  The man thinks she's just being cute or kinky and gladly pays her 20 bucks, and they have sex.  The next time they're about to have sex, same thing, she says it will cost 20 bucks to have sex.  Again the man gladly pays it.

So this goes on for a number of years.  Every they're about to have sex, he has to pay 20 bucks.  The man ultimately looks at it like it's cute, and he gets to have sex.  He also feels that since his wife is just a simple housewife, he wants her to have pocket money incase she wants to buy herself something like new clothes or whatever.  And again, he loves having sex with her.  Again this happens for a number of years, and they're now older and have 3 kids together.

One day his wife comes home to find her husband clearly drunk and crying at the kitchen table.  She says ""Honey what's wrong?"" The man explains to her that unfortunately his law firm downsized and since he's not a partner, they had to let him go.  The man then says ""What are we gonna do? We have 3 kids and bills, etc.""

His wife tells him not to worry and explains to him that all those times she asked for 20 bucks, well she saved it everytime and put it away for their retirement, and they're now worth 3 million dollars!  The man grabbed her and held her in his arms.  Then he said ""Wow if I would've known that's what you were doing, I would've given you all of my business!""",Husband Pays His Wife 20 bucks every time they have sex...,41

One night we were having dinner in the fancy steak house.  There’s a magician that does little tricks for the tables, which is usually fairly simple but also impressive especially if you’ve been drinking. 

The restaurant wasn’t very full; our side had us, one young couple and a table of four 45-60 year olds all very drunk and having a good time. Once we had all seen the magicians acts, we broke the ice with them and discussed the “magic” for a bit as well as some other small talk. 

One of the guys asked someone if they had cash and says I got a magic trick for you. My dad gave him a 20 so the guy says “All money has 3 things on it. A famous president, a type of cream and a famous movie. Any idea what they are? Well, The answer is Andrew Jackson.  Half and half (*rips money in half*) and Gone with the Wind (*throws bill in air*).” 

He snorted and then immediately gave my dad a clean $20 out of his wallet and said something like “sorry I couldn’t resist”. We went back to our dinner after a short good laugh and more discussion here and there.  It was pretty funny how he did it, although it can definitely be rude if someone were to do it at the wrong person, I’m sure. 

At the check, we noticed they were finishing around the same time. My dad laughed to himself and got up. Soon after he returned and then the waiter a few seconds after with our check. My dad waited to pay until the table of 4 men got their check as well, at which point my dad asks if they want to see a trick as well. He lifts up our bill and rips in half proclaiming I can send my bill to your table simply ripping it up. (They hadn’t even noticed our bill had been added to theirs, I presume because they were hammered) so when the guy looked down he was amazingly shocked at how my dad could have pulled off such a trick. He starts laughing and saying how he has to pay for our dinner now. My dad walked over and shook his hand and admitted he just had the waiter in on it, but the rich table of four laughed and said they didn’t care because it was funny nonetheless. They refused to let us pay for our meal, so we quickly accepted the offer. We talked more and left all smiles in the room. 

So basically, we sent our bill to a drunk table pretending it was a dumb magic trick yet when we went to fix it they wanted to pay for our meal anyways. Dad turned humor into a several hundred dollar coupon.",How to get drunk people to pay for your meal,4

A redneck is being berated by his momma to find himself a woman. Having enough of her shenanigans, he finally decides to go out into the world and find the woman of his dreams.

His search ended quiet quickly, as he met woman at one of the local bars. He said jokingly to the woman, “This place’d be better if they served moonshine here!”

The woman laughed, and they started casual conversation. By the end of the night, the man knew she was the one!

He finally asked the question. “Honey, you’re amazing. I want you to meet my parents, if you’d be so kind.” To which, she readily agreed.

Before they got there, the woman said, “Fuck it. I want to make love. You’ve been so amazing to me tonight.” So the truck stops, and as the man is taking off her clothes, he notices one of her legs is made of metal, ending at the upper thigh.

“What’s this?” He asked. She politely responded, “Oh, well, when I was just four years old, my granddaddy got in a car crash. By the time the ambulance arrived, they could tell they had to amputate to save me from the debris in my leg. I was lucky; granddaddy never made it.”

The man teared up, and said he was sorry. Out of the mood, they both decided to just meet and greet his parents, and then go on another date one day. The woman was about to put her jeans back on, but the redneck told her to just wear a pair of his shorts, as it was hot out. She happily obliged.

They arrived to his house, and he yelled out, “Momma! I got me a new girl! You’ll be so proud of me!”

Little did he know, his dad had not gone to work that night, and when his dad saw the girl, he told her to get off his property before he starts shooting.

They had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.

At the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: ""Lads! Lads! I've got a great idea! We’re all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!"" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.

The lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. With a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.

By the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again ""that was great, that was great, let's do it again!"". 

The lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care ""Come on! let's go again, that was great!"".

The potato turned to him and said ""Easy peasy, lemon's queasy.""

Then after many moons, I got a notification on that post. With a surprise I read that comment. It was of a girl. That comment told me to search for that music on r/Jokes. I was amazed. Why on earth r/Jokes started giving OSTs and songs and music. I asked her for the reason.

Twenty days pass and he still isn't back and Mick and Alan are starving, but a promise is a promise.

Fortunes in ill-gotten gains were won and lost in such places, so it was a surprise to many that the old crook who haunted the craps table had never lost a single game. Speakeasy after speakeasy had kicked him out for what they had assumed be subtle cheating. But the only deviation from the norm during games as far as the old man was concerned was that he had a habit of rubbing a couple of very ancient looking ivory dice hanging on a chain around his time-weathered neck, and shortly thereafter he’d win. But, time goes on, and those who had once gossiped about the strange old man’s dice now gossiped about upon the strange way the old man had died, and what he had willed to his only son. He was left everything, his father’s houses and cars and a thick envelope full of his gambling winnings. None of these mattered to the son until he found the dice and, thinking of his father’s habit, rubbed them and wept. Suddenly, out from the dice came plumes of smoke, and suddenly two tall men, dressed like Ancient Persians, stood where the clouds had been. “WHO HAS AWOKEN US” said the first. “Uh-I’m Salvatore, my father was Carlo...Carlo the Corsican”

They could see however that he was not like his father, so they gave him the customary three wishes, made him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams, even wealthier than his father’s gambling winnings, for the second wish they introduced him to his soulmate so that his money and love could be shared. But when they asked him his third wish he grew sad, and asked the pair why they had ended his father’s life. So they told him the story of how long ago they’d been imprisoned in a set of dice, how the dice had been passed from hand to hand and used for their luck-giving ability for a thousand years. They told him they had relayed the same to his father, who had re-imprisoned them in the dice and capitalized on their magical abilities, until they had influenced his heart as they hung so close to it, causing him one day to drop dead on the spot. “But why’d you have to kill him, you could have just left?”
To this the mighty genie replied: “OUR WAYS MAY SEEM STRANGE TO YOU, O MAN, BUT WE’VE BEEN SPENDING MOST OUR LIVES, LIVING IN THIS GANGSTERS PAIR OF DICE.”",(LONG) There was once an old mobster who liked to gamble,14

A redneck is being berated by his momma to find himself a woman. Having enough of her shenanigans, he finally decides to go out into the world and find the woman of his dreams.

His search ended quiet quickly, as he met woman at one of the local bars. He said jokingly to the woman, “This place’d be better if they served moonshine here!”

The woman laughed, and they started casual conversation. By the end of the night, the man knew she was the one!

He finally asked the question. “Honey, you’re amazing. I want you to meet my parents, if you’d be so kind.” To which, she readily agreed.

Before they got there, the woman said, “Fuck it. I want to make love. You’ve been so amazing to me tonight.” So the truck stops, and as the man is taking off her clothes, he notices one of her legs is made of metal, ending at the upper thigh.

“What’s this?” He asked. She politely responded, “Oh, well, when I was just four years old, my granddaddy got in a car crash. By the time the ambulance arrived, they could tell they had to amputate to save me from the debris in my leg. I was lucky; granddaddy never made it.”

The man teared up, and said he was sorry. Out of the mood, they both decided to just meet and greet his parents, and then go on another date one day. The woman was about to put her jeans back on, but the redneck told her to just wear a pair of his shorts, as it was hot out. She happily obliged.

They arrived to his house, and he yelled out, “Momma! I got me a new girl! You’ll be so proud of me!”

Little did he know, his dad had not gone to work that night, and when his dad saw the girl, he told her to get off his property before he starts shooting.

Pissed, the redneck son asks what the hell his problem is.

“Son, now ain’t I told you a hundred times that we don’t allow no knee-gears on our property!”

""Soooo, tourist, huh‽""  
""Yes… yes indeed. Does it show?""  
""Nah, 't's just that only regulars and tourists come here… y'know, fo' the thrill""

""I don't believe you.""  
""You what? I ain't no liars, no sir! I… I'll show you!""

The drunk gets up from his stool — which is by far the most difficult part of his demonstration ­— opens the balcony door, goes out and jumps. The tourists sees the man fall sideways to the left, then, after a few seconds, he sees the man come back from the right of the building, safely land on the balcony again and come back inside with a proud smile on his face.

The tourist can't believe his eyes. He decides to give it a try. He goes out on the balcony, jumps, and falls down towards the ground, never to be seen again.

The drunk guy shrugs and goes back to the bar to finish his beer. The barman leans to him and says:

""There is only only way to possibly cure it, but the procedure is very risky and unorthodox. You see, I can graft tissue from an elephant's truck into your penis, which could allow you to achieve an erection.""

The man, horrified at the prospect of never having sex again agrees to the procedure.

Months later, the man is on his first date after the operation and is a bit nervous sitting across from the beautiful woman at a fancy restaurant. Just then he feels a tingling, foreign sensation between his legs and realizes his penis is bursting to get out his zipper hole. The pressure becomes too great and the man undoes his zipper. 

Just then, his penis reaches up to the table, grabs bread from the basket and disappears back into his pants.

The woman's eyes go wide as she looks at the man, whose eyes are also very wide with a stunned look on his face.

""Uh...could you do that again?"" asks the woman.

""I...I think so..."" the man says slowly. ""But I don't know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass""",A man is told by his doctor that he'll never again have a erection.,123

A redneck is being berated by his momma to find himself a woman. Having enough of her shenanigans, he finally decides to go out into the world and find the woman of his dreams.

His search ended quiet quickly, as he met woman at one of the local bars. He said jokingly to the woman, “This place’d be better if they served moonshine here!”

The woman laughed, and they started casual conversation. By the end of the night, the man knew she was the one!

He finally asked the question. “Honey, you’re amazing. I want you to meet my parents, if you’d be so kind.” To which, she readily agreed.

Before they got there, the woman said, “Fuck it. I want to make love. You’ve been so amazing to me tonight.” So the truck stops, and as the man is taking off her clothes, he notices one of her legs is made of metal, ending at the upper thigh.

“What’s this?” He asked. She politely responded, “Oh, well, when I was just four years old, my granddaddy got in a car crash. By the time the ambulance arrived, they could tell they had to amputate to save me from the debris in my leg. I was lucky; granddaddy never made it.”

The man teared up, and said he was sorry. Out of the mood, they both decided to just meet and greet his parents, and then go on another date one day. The woman was about to put her jeans back on, but the redneck told her to just wear a pair of his shorts, as it was hot out. She happily obliged.

They arrived to his house, and he yelled out, “Momma! I got me a new girl! You’ll be so proud of me!”

Little did he know, his dad had not gone to work that night, and when his dad saw the girl, he told her to get off his property before he starts shooting.

Pissed, the redneck son asks what the hell his problem is.

As they left, the younger doctor remarked, ""You didn't even examine that woman!""

""Perhaps you should cut back a bit and see if that helps.""

But he must not press any of the buttons inside. They were labelled WW, WA, PP, and ATR.

The man’s curiousity got the best of him and he started pressing the buttons one by one.

When he pressed WW, warm fragrant water was sprayed all over his entire bottom.

Still curious, he pressed the button marked WA, and a gentle breeze of warm air quickly dried his hindquarters. He thought this was fantastic and reached for the button marked PP.

This yielded a large powder puff that delicately applied a soft talc to his rear. Naturally, he couldn’t resist the last button marked ATR.

When he woke up in the hospital, he buzzed for the nurse. “What happened to me? The last thing I remember is that I was in the new ladies’ room on a plane.”

“Yes,” replied the nurse, “apparently you were having a great time until you pressed the ATR button, which stands for Automatic Tampon Remover.","A man travelling by plane was in urgent need of the toilet. But each time he looked up, the illuminated sign proclaimed that it was occupied.",0

There was this young boy who fantasized about flying like the birds one day. Every day after school he would try to make an invention that would allow him to soar above the clouds. 

Every time he failed. Kids would bully him for flailing to the ground instead of floating. But this boy persevered. He would fly one day. Just not yet. 

30 years gone by and he was getting closer. He could feel it. Of course his whole town knew what he was doing, and of course they called him crazy. He didn't care. He WOULD fly. He had to. 

One day at work he had a revelation and dashed back home. Working all night and all day an this groundbreaking idea, his hands fleeting, his blueprints rustling. When this invention, no, masterpiece was completed, he stared at it in awe. The structure was two identical wings that you slipped onto your hands and arms. They bore a resemblance to bat wings.

The now man prepared himself for flight. Readying himself, he started flapping his arms. He could feel the lift created by his beautiful wings. Running as fast as his legs would allow, he lifted off. It worked! His masterpiece worked! He was filled with exhilaration, heart beating at 100 kilometres per hour. A strong, sure breeze whipped him into the sky, following the birds cawing at the strange sight. He broke through the clouds as happy as can be. No-one could call him a madman now.

He flew for hours, enjoying the sweet, gentle push of the wind. But a heavy feeling dawned on him. He looked down, then up, then down again, and then exclaimed quite glumly, ""How do I land?""",My Shaggy Dog Joke,4

As the veteran approaches the stand, he see that an old Jewish man wrapped in a prayer shawl is in charge of the stand, selling neckties at $35 a piece. When he asks if he happens to have any water, the vendor flatly tells him that he doesn't have any water with him, but he does have neckties available for purchase at $35 each. The veteran responds by saying that he doesn't want to purchase any of the old man's overpriced ties, but what would be helpful is if he could receive the directions for the nearest place where he can find water. The vendor tells him that if he continues two kilometers east up a hill, there's a restaurant there where he can find cold water. Seeing that the restaurant is his last beacon of hope, the veteran sets out on the hill, determined to find water.

One neighbor plants orange trees, another plants apple trees, a third plants plum trees, and the man who suggested the idea plants peach trees. 

A neighbor across the street notices the commotion, and asks what is going on. Once he hears, he pitches the same idea to his block of neighbors. 

After a few years, when the trees start to bear fruit, the man who started it all finds himself feuding with the other contributers of his community garden. Whenever they aren't fighting over the garden, they are shunning and avoiding each other.

He notices, however, that the neighbors across the street are better friends than ever! On top of their normal polite greeting, they are constantly doing favors for one another, such as mowing each other's lawns. To his surprise, their garden also seems to be in disarray, with many of their trees appearing to have broken branches.

He goes over to the man's house that had inquired about his own community garden proposal, and asks for advice. 

""My neighbors and I can't stand each other or this community garden anymore. One neighbor is allergic to plums and insists that makes him entitled to twice as many of my peaches! Another neighbor shoots any animals that come near the trees, and my wife has threatened to call the cops. He told me if my wife calls the cops, he'll break my legs!

I turned to her and said, 'Do you want to have Sex?'
'No,' she answered.
I then said, 'Is that your final answer?'

She didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, 'Yes..'
So I said, ""Then I'd like to phone a friend.""

And that's when the fight started...

________________________________

I took my wife to a restaurant.

The waiter, for some reason, took my order first.

""I'll have the rump steak, rare, please.""
He said, ""Aren't you worried about the mad cow?""
""Nah, she can order for herself.""

And that's when the fight started.....

_____________________________

My wife and I were sitting at a table at her high school
reunion, and she kept staring at a drunken man swigging his
drink as he sat alone at a nearby table.

I asked her, ""Do you know him?""
""Yes"", she sighed,
""He's my old boyfriend. I understand he took to drinking
right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear he
hasn't been sober since.""

""My God!"" I said, ""Who would think a person could go on
celebrating that long?""

And then the fight started...

________________________________

When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed.
But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat,
making beer.. Always something more important to me.

Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point.
When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing
scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into
the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again
I handed her a toothbrush.

I said, ""When you finish cutting the
grass, you might as well sweep the driveway.""

The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp.

_____________________________

My wife sat down next to me as I was flipping channels.
She asked, ""What's on TV?""
I said, ""Dust.""

And then the fight started...

________________________________

Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, and slipped quietly into the garage. I hooked up the
boat up to the van and proceeded to back out into a torrential 
downpour. The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather
would be bad all day.

I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. I cuddled up to my wife's back;
now with a different anticipation,
and whispered, ""The weather out there is terrible.""

My loving wife of 5 years replied, ""And, can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?""

And that's how the fight started...

_______________________________

My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.
She said, ""I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.""

I bought her a bathroom scale.

And then the fight started......

______________________________

After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply
for Social Security. The woman behind the counter asked me

for my driver's License to verify my age. I looked in my pockets

and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that

I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later.

The woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'.
So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair.

She said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application.

When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office.

She said, 'You should have dropped
your pants. You might have gotten disability too.'

And then the fight started...

________________________________

My wife was standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.

She was not happy with what she saw and said to me,
""I feel horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you
to pay me a compliment.'

I replied, ""Your eyesight's damn near perfect.""

And then the fight started........

________________________________

I rear-ended a car this morning...the start of a REALLY bad day!

The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!!
He looked up at me and said 'I am NOT Happy!'
So I said, 'Well, which one ARE you then?'

That's how the fight started.

McLaren kept on with his little ruse on the one remaining push bike that kept turning up at the studio....and he progressed from removing parts to trying to hacksaw through the handlebars and wheels, anything to create damage.

The son eventually graduated University, found a wife, got married and moved away for job reasons. 

Unfortunately, one day the old man's wife passes away, leaving him alone in his house with a huge garden.

After a lot of grief, the man has the idea of bringing the garden to new life. However, not being young anymore, it seems like an impossible task for him alone.

He writes to his son: ""My dear son, after your mother's death, I am finally ready to move on. I'd like to bring our old garden to new life. Unfortunately, the task seems to be too much for an old man like me. I know you're busy with work and family, but maybe you could help me with digging over the old patches. This would help a lot. Love, your father."" 

Some time later he receives a short message from his son: ""Father. Please keep away from the patches. It's where I hid the 'Thing'. Your son.""

The next morning, combined forces of FBI, NSA and HS invade the property and the neighborhood. They start questioning everyone and search the man's garden inch after inch, soil layer after soil layer. In the evening, they still haven't found anything and finally give up. 

The man receives another message from his son: ""Dear Father, I'm glad that you want to move on after Mom's death. Work and family prevent me from visiting you right now, but after the recent visit of the authorities your garden should be dug over and ready for renewal. That's the best I could do at the moment. Love, your son.""",A Muslim man came to the USA many years ago.,390

Timmy, a boy at the age of 8. Is on vacation with his grandparents in Cannon beach, Oregon.

Little did timmy know, grandma had already packed a lunch for him and grandpa. Sandwiches,   juice, and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.
(The cookies were for timmy alone). 

Grandpa and grandson get ready and head out with all of the essentials on hand. They arrive at the beach in ruffly ten minutes, start setting up their things, and then get to building sandcastles.

Timmy watches as grandpa cracks open a cold beer from the cooler. ""Can I have one of those please?"" Says timmy. Grandpa replies, ""Well boy, can your dick touch your asshole?"" Confused, Timmy answers no. ""Well then, you can't have one."" Said grandpa.

Timmy pouts a little bit, but then goes back to playing. Sometime later grandpa lights a cigarette. Timmy's asks, ""hey grandpa can I try one of those?"" Grandpa replies, ""well boy, can your dick touch your asshole?"" Timmy shrugs, ""No."" Grandpa again tells him, ""Then you can't have one."" 

More time passes and they both are starting to feel hungry. Timmy, (A young boy of 8) immediately goes for the cookies his grandma had made him. Grandpa asks, ""Hey boy! Let me get one of those cookies."" Timmy replies, ""well grandpa, can your dick touch your asshole?""

Grandpa quickly says, ""It sure can!!!""
Timmy fires right back at him and says, ""Good! go fuck yourself grandpa, because grandma made these cookies for me!""

The police department released a statement to the public, warning them to be especially cautious until the killer was captured and brought to justice. The news, while shocking, did not concern most of the townspeople as the general public was not being targeted by the killer. The only victims that had been found so far had been prominent figures of various types of religions. A few Buddhist monks, two Catholic priests, a Muslim imam, and a Jewish rabbi. 

Various places of worship in the town were advised to suspend all activities in an effort to protect their leaders, as well as their followers, from the killer. The police department began interviewing the different religious groups to see if anyone in town had witnessed any unusual behavior within their respective circles. 

Eventually they got a lead on a suspicious man that had been seen hanging around the cloisters where a group of nuns were known to spend a lot of their time at. The police immediately sent all of their available units to the location where the man had been seen last, but they were unfortunately too late. They arrived to see the man kneeling over top of a slain nun, who seemed to have been stabbed multiple times. They immediately arrested the man and brought him down to the station. 

The man kept shouting that he was innocent, and that he had found the nun just after the killer had stabbed her. He kept babbling about the police “having the wrong guy” and how “the killer was still out there”. However, he was covered in blood at the scene of the crime and the police firmly believed that there was too much evidence for this to be a coincidence. Nonetheless, they wanted to question him regarding the previous murders and to see if he had any accomplices. 

After a few minutes of questioning the man in custody, a different officer burst into the police station yelling that another nun had just been murdered at the same cloisters where the man had been found!! They realized that their guy could not be the serial killer as the 2nd murder had happened only moments ago.

The man in custody jumps up and says, “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you! The real bloke’s in the convents!”",Did you hear the one about the murderer loose in Australia?,3

He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns and oysters from the barbecue, and flirting.

Then at the height of the party, the millionaire said, ""I have a 15 foot man-eating crocodile in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who'll join him in the pool.""

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.

Everyone turned around and saw Brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, Brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.

An exhausted Brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.

The millionaire said, ""Well, Brian, I reckon I owe you a million dollars then.""

""Nah, you all right boss, I don't want it,"" said Brian.

So the millionaire said ""Man, I have to give you something. You won the bet. How about half a million bucks?""

""No thanks, I don't want it,"" Brian insisted.

The millionaire said, ""Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was amazing. How about a new Porsche, a Rolex and some stock options?""

Once again, Brian said, ""No.""

Confused, the rich man asked, ""Well Brian, then what do you want?""

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. 

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. 

MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""",The lookout,69

""Well,"" says the Nescafe man somewhat chastened, ""We anticipated your reluctance.

For this reason, and the importance of the Lord's prayer to all Catholics, we will increase our offer to $300 million. All we require is that you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'.""

Again, even more sternly, the Pope replies, ""That, my son, is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord and it must not be changed.""

Finally, the Nescafe Director says, ""Your Holiness, we at Nescafe respect your adherence to the faith, we realise that tradition is essential to your beliefs, we fully understand the importance of the word of the Lord but we do have one final offer.

One day he is all alone, having a cold he decided to stay at home while his wife is at her job and kids are out in school.

He hears a knock on the door and goes to answer  it.And there he is, Johny ,he found him he is standing there with a ice cream in a cone and says -Fuck you dad I hate you.

The dad cant believe his eyes and all his rage from his dark days comes back.He runs to the kitchen picking up a knife getting ready to stab that little bitch Johny multiple times,its him who made him like that after all ,he is the one who deserves to be punished not his old wife and kids.But as he puts the knife in the air to kill him he just stops not being able to do it.He was a changed man he was ready to forgive him for all the damage he did to his brain.The dad put the knife down and sighed asking ""Why, why do you hate me Johny you were my favorite, I tried everything to please you and then you came with those puns and I didnt understand a thing I did some bad things ,I am sure you have heard of it...""

""Yes son?""

-Can I have some money I really need it.

Ready to understand and hoping this madness will finally end he pulls out some bills out of his pocket and gives it all to Johny.Johny leaves.

He rushes to the door all in blood ""its that fucking  Johny""

He opens the door and to his suprise it wasnt Johny it was the police.The neighbours heard some screams and no one was answering the phone.The dad gets arested and his real identity comes fourth giving him a life in prison for murdering his family twice.

He gets put in a looney bin since he was killing all his prison cell mates.

One day a guy comes claiming to be his only son he didnt kill and asks for a talk with his father.Hoping the kid will help his fathers condition the staff arrange for a meeting between the father and son.The son asks to talk to the father alone without anyone to hear or supervise them.They are hesitant but after he signs some papers that he isnt guaranteed safety they make it work heavily guarding around the room so they cant escape, but not listening in.

The father is sitting there all tied up looking at Johny regreting that day he gave him his first 10 bucks.

-Hey dad, I fucking hate you.-said Johny.

The father felt like he was teasing him.

""Why did you come Johny,want more money?""

-What do you think I spent that money on?

""Well on candy,lolipops ,kinder suprises...I mean right?""

-You think that lolipop is 10 bucks or that kinder suprise 20?
