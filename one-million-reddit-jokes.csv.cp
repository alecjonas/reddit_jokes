A few hours later I arrived home and asked the babysitter how things went, “She said everything went good the kid never woke up or even made a sound.” 

I said, “That’s great. Could you do me a favor and go check on them?”

A few seconds later she came back screaming, “The kids not there, their not in the bed it’s empty.”

I ran to the room to check, with the babysitter following right behind me. Sure enough no one was in the room. We then checked everywhere. We both started freaking out.

I asked her, “When was the last time you saw them?”

“I never saw them, you told me not to go in the room and wake them up.”

I said, “Ok, I’ll take of things from here you go home and try to get some rest.”

She begrudgingly agreed and eventually went home. 

She called me the next day, and asked if I had found my child to which I replied, “Unfortunately they haven’t been found yet.”

Several months passed and every day she would call, and ask the same question, and I would give the same answer, “Sorry they haven’t been found yet.”

calling.

Hypnotized by awe, she walks closer to the edge and unknowingly steps on a loose piece of earth which gives way. She screams as she falls down the cliff, grabbing onto a branch just a few meters down. ""HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!"" she screams. An off-duty police officer hiking hears her and runs to the side of the cliff. ""Hang on! I'm a cop! I'm coming!"" He sees the area of earth missing and carefully looks at the ground. Remembering one of the many lessons in his training of rescue, he sees which ground is ok to walk on, then proceeds closer to the edge. He looks over and sees the woman hanging on with both hands and arms wrapped around the branch, now whimpering and breathing heavily. Remembering his training again, he reassures the woman she will be ok and not to look down, a calming technique. ""Oh...ok..."" she weeps, wrapping her arms around tighter. The cop has on his phone numbers to call for backup, and being in the middle of the woods he decides to call the rangers first, as they are experts in this sort of environment as his training told him to phone the most suitable and nearest rescuers first. 

Then he calls the cops and firefighters who should also be able to make it via helicopters, another vital piece of training so he knows to get all the assistance necessary for the rescue. Then he asks another factor of rescue training, asking her if the branch feels strong enough to support her weight and whether there are any ledges she could stand on in. ""Yes it is strong enough!"" she calls. ""I see no ledges...wait no! There's one!"" The woman stretches her legs onto the ledge, but, unfortunately, her hands move over a part of the branch with slippery moss on it...and with one quick slip there is a final ear-piercing screech as she falls down to her death...the cop only watches in horror and agony as the poor hiker gets smaller and smaller and shoots down faster and faster into the mercy of mother nature till she disappears. He falls back and weeps and weeps. The rest of the rescuers the next day search where she fell but her body is never found, and is presumed by the guilt-stricken cop to have been eaten by wild animals. 

""You did all you could,"" the cop's boss and family tell him. ""The best you could, you have demonstrated your years of vigorous training amazingly."" The cop takes a few days off to let out more tears of relief, and when he finally feels like returning to the job of being in the police station one night shift, the door opens and in walks...the hiker! She is covered in cuts, bruises, and one arm broken. Her left foot twisted with no shoes and only rags of clothing left. Mud and dust covers ever inch of her skin and hair. ""I....I survived..."" she utters to him. ""I...l-l-landed...in the soft top of a tree...of old bird nests and thick tufts of leaves...God fucking bless..."" she cries. ""My god...?!"" gasps the cop when his mind comprehends what he has just heard. ""I thought you were dead!""

“By all means officer, just don’t go in that field over there”, I replied.

A gentleman was spotted this evening walking over the Berkley Moors, on his own, without a dog.
 
A few locals were concerned over the situation and called the local high visibility-vest wearing, non-police, community support for, um, support. None was given. They professed that this was not a crime, and that even if it was they still could do absolutely nothing.
 
The stunned locals were still adamant that this was unheard of and that something should be done, the man in question was not even walking hand in hand with a significant other and it was bitterly cold.
 
One local, who has chosen to remain nameless, but we shall know her as Mavis, exclaimed, “I have never known anything of the like, this is absolute madness he could be a rapist or burglary person, who knows what he was thinking, I was for one was absolutely terrified and my wee Jack Russell, Terrance was utterly not himself.”
 
Talking to the accused, he said, “it was a brisk evening and while his Sunday Roast was roasting away in the oven he asked his wife, Geraldine if she fancied a stroll in the early evening sun of a fresh November? To which she returned that she would rather boil and eat her own toenails that she was currently pedicuring, so he decided to take the walk himself. He added that he meant no harm or to raise alarm but that he could see how it could have brought tension to the moors.
 
Since chatting and relating to the people of Berkley, the man, who is known locally as George will now be looking at getting himself a dog or a cat with a lead. No further action has been taken.",Dogless Wonder,3

Trump met the Queen of England in her palace
Trump: ""Your Majesty, any tips you can give me to prevent slow down in economy ?""

""Well,"" said the Queen, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""

Trump frowned, and then asked, ""But how do I know the people around me
are intelligent?""

The Queen: ""Easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle.""

The Queen pushed a button on her intercom. ""David Cameron, would you come in here, please?""

David Cameron walked into the room and said, ""Yes, ma'am?""

The Queen smiled and said, ""Answer me this please, David. Your mother and father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

Without pausing for a moment, David Cameron answered, ""That would be me, ma'am.""

""Very good! Thank you, David !"" said the Queen.

Then she turned to Trump with a smile and said ""See?""

Now its Trump’s turn to apply the same logic.... 

Trump returned to the USA and asked Pence..
""Pence, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

""I'm not sure,"" said Pence . ""Let me get back to you on that one...""

Pence went to his advisors and asked every one, but none could give him an answer...

Finally, he ran into Obama and asked, ""can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""..

Obama answered, ""That's easy, it's me!""..

Pence said, ""Thanks!""

Then he went back to Trump. ""I did some thinking and I have the answer to that riddle. It's Obama...""😎

Trump shouted at him.... And told him

post,d4fluv,2qh72,jokes,false,1568519881,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d4fluv/a_politician_dies/,self.jokes,,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",A politician dies...,9842

A live test ensues and the rocket makes it around the moon but lands 100 feet away from its initial position. Amazed, the warden says ""We might have a winner here!""

""I've made a jet that travels at the speed of light, it will fly around the earth and come back to its exact takeoff position in less than a second"" says the Japanese.

No one believed him at first, but he presses a button and sure enough the jet does fly around earth and lands 50 feet away from its starting position in a blink of an eye.

Everyone is astonished, ""Impressive! You might have won this, but let's see what the Italian made before I make my judgement"" Says the warden.

""I will now pee out of my belly button"" Replies the confident Italian man. Everyone's jaw drops, and they wonder how he would do that.

A man takes the day off work to go out golfing. He is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green.

&amp;#x200B;

He thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, ""Ribbit, 9 iron.""



The man looks around and doesn't see anyone.



""Ribbit, 9 iron.""



He looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts his club away and grabs his 9 iron. Boom! He hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked. He says to the frog, ""Wow, that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?""



The frog replies, ""Ribbit, lucky frog.""



The man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole. ""What do you think, frog?"" The man asks.



""Ribbit, 3 wood.""



He takes out a 3 wood and WHAM!, hole in one. The man is befuddled and doesn't know what to say. By the end of the day, The man golfed the best game of golf in his life and asks the frog, ""OK, where to next?""



The frog replies, ""Ribbit, Las Vegas."" They arive at Las Vegas at a casino. He says, ""OK frog, now what?""

&amp;#x200B;

The frog says, ""Ribbit, roulette.""



Upon approaching the roulette table, The man asks, ""What do you think I should bet?""



The frog replies, ""Ribbit, $300,000, black, 6.""



Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game, He figures what the heck.Whoosh! Tons of cash comes sliding back across the table. The man uses some of his winnings to pay for the best hotel room he can find ""Frog, I don't know how to repay you. You've won me all this money, and I am forever grateful.""



The frog replies, ""Ribbit, kiss me.""



He figures, why not? Since after all the frog did for him, he deserves it. With a kiss, the frog turns into a 15-year-old girl.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single Banana as his last meal. 

After eating the Banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Russian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two Bananas. 

After eating the Bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three oranges.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid fruit and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Orange you glad I didn't say bananas?"".",There was a man in Russia that drove a train for a living.,2

In World War I there was trench warfare, and neither the Americans nor the Germans could get the upper hand. They were reaching a stalemate. One day, an American came up with a plan that would win them the war. This private explained his plan to his trench mates, and they figured, ""Why not? It's not like we have any better ideas."" The next day, an American soldier called out, ""Hans!?"" A German popped up and shouted back, ""Ja?!"" Boom, the German was shot dead. The next day the Americans shouted again, ""Hans?!"" ""Ja?!"" Shot dead. This process continued over the next couple of days. The Germans were losing large numbers, and were now finally catching on.

The Germans had an emergency meeting. They thought they could come back from the heavy losses using the same tactics as the Americans. Thus, a German asked, ""What is a popular American name?"" ""John!"" replied another. The next day, the Germans decided to execute their plan. A German shouted, ""John!?"" An American called back, ""Is that you Hans?!"" ""Ja!"" And that is how the Americans won WWI.",The Germans and Americans were reaching a stalemate in WWI.,2

He could beat up a gang with a baguette, trap someone in a giant pita, or cushion someone's fall with swiftly-rising dough. He was beloved by all in the city, for his escapades had the lovely side-effect of feeding the entire city for a week. He would keep the city free of crime and malice by driving around in his Breadmobile.

Our hero had his enemies and allies, of course. Chief among his enemies was a man simply known as Dr. Cobra. Dr. Cobra and his pet snake strove to sow the seeds of discord in Loafington, and he came up with elaborate plot after elaborate plot, that was always foiled by Wonderbread. And Wonderbread counted among his allies, the brilliant Yeastboy, a child prodigy who had volunteered to act as his sidekick. Yeastboy's real name was Hunter Godwin, though the press didn't know that.

On one particular day, Dr. Cobra had infiltrated the city's water supply, intending to use his venom to give everyone a terrible stomachache. Our heroes leaped into the Breadmobile and raced to the scene, driving at a breakneck pace.

When they arrived, their first enemy was Dr. Cobra's pet snake. A towering beast, far larger than any normal snake, it swayed and slithered, ready to strike if they got any closer.

""I know,"" said Yeastboy, who threw a couple of buns forwards. ""That'll distract him!""

The snake seemed... unimpressed.

""No, Hunter,"" Wonderbread said, applying the wisdom of years. ""*This* is how you fight snakes.""

And Wonderbread clapped his hands together, and summoned indian flatbread to fall from the sky. The snake glanced up, and immediately slithered to eat at the bread.

""Wha- how did you know?"" Wonderbread asked.

""The anconda don't want naan unless you've got buns, Hunter,"" he nodded sagely. ""Now hurry, Dr. Cobra is getting away!""

They leaped into the Breadmobile, chasing down the Doctor. However, with their vehicle driving so quickly, any and all of the dough and bread and pastry they fired at the doctor couldn't possibly hit him, instead flying backwards as a tasty treat for some citizen.

""What do we do?"" screamed Hunter.

""I have a plan. It's... not something I would normally consider, but I don't think I have a choice,"" Wonderbread said, stepping down harder on the accelerator.

""You're not gonna... ram him, are you?"" Hunter asked.

""That's right,"" he said, solemnly, as if he too were afraid of the implication. ""I'm going to brake bread with the enemy.""","In the City of Loafington, there lived a superhero named Wonderbread.",10

He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.

He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Ferrari.""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: First - you have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem."" The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 - but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is..""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!"" He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!

Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.

A ""heads up"" for you all who may be regular Home Depot  
customers.  


Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam.

  
While out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you.  


Here's how the scam works:  


Two seriously good-looking 18 or 19-year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It is impossible not to look.  


When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say ""No"" and instead ask you for a ride to another Home Depot.

&amp;#x200B;

You agree and they get in the back seat. On the way, they start having sex with each other. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and performs oral sex on you, while the other one steals your wallet.  


I had my wallet stolen August 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 28th, three times just yesterday, and very  
likely again this upcoming weekend as soon as I can buy some more wallets.",Home Depot Scam,1774

Eventually God looks down and notices that he’ll is no longer, well, hell. He calls the devil up to explain what’s going on so the devil tells him, “I got an engineer, it’s awesome!”

God exclaims “An engineer!? I’m sorry that was a mistake you need to send him to heaven where he belongs.”

The devil laughs and tells him no. 

God says “don’t make me sue you over this.”

The devil starts cackling and asks “Where are YOU going to get a lawyer!”

""Oops,"" the daughter said, but the man did not care, because it was just a butterfly.

The man, after thinking for a while, suspected this to be the cause of his daughter killing that butterfly. Keeping that in mind, they just proceeded throughout the day ignoring the missing butter.

The next day, the daughter finds a cockroach, and steps on it, in turn killing it. The man is terrified at the sight of this and is frozen in fear, but nothing happens to him. He is overjoyed and decides the butter was just the coincidence.

The day after, during breakfast, the wife called to the man, ""Honey, all the cocks are dead, none of them are breathing.""

The man, after thinking for a while, came to the realization that whatever the daughter kills, if its name starts with something else's name, is dead or disappears. With that, the man decides to look over everything the daughter does.

The following day, the daughter is playing catch with her younger brother. But she accidentally knocks over the grandfather-clock and it comes crashing down and breaks. The man, knowing that his wife does not have a father, only a mother, and anyway, things only die or disappear when the daughter kills the animals, not when she breaks things, is not too worried, but decides to go to his parent's place anyway and stay there for the night so nothing happens to them.

The next day, the man seeing how nothing happened to his father, returns home.

So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they’ve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is becoming a pretty popular guy.

One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and asks with a sneer, “So, how’s it going down there in hell?”

Satan replies, “Hey, things are going great. We’ve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and there’s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.”

God replies, “What??? You’ve got an engineer? That’s a mistake — he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.”

Satan says, “No way! I like having an engineer on the staff, and I’m keeping him.”

God says, “Send him back up here or I’ll sue.”

Satan laughs uproariously and answers, “Yeah right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?”",An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates.,152

Bart was a regular fellow, quite charming actually. But he farted often than most.

Bart has obatined that sweet sweet yes from the girl of his dream, they agreed to a date on his now girlfriend's house.

They were eating, chatting, laughing, until he had the sudden urge to fart. Of course like any decent gentleman he chose not to embarrass himself and hold it in. But he failed and it came out almost instantly.

""Max, get out of here right now!"" His girlfriend said. Max was her dog that was sitting just beside their table.

Bart was relieved that she thought it was the dog that farted! Looks like he got away this time.

Now Max the obedient boy that he is, went straight under the table, girlfrien.. let's just call her Annie from now, just ignored him and continued on their date.

About 5 minutes have passed and Bart had the urge to fart again. He's not called Farty Bart for nothing.

This time it was one of those farts that are labeled ""silent but deadly"" Bart wanted to be sneaky and just let it out without a sound, praying Annie wouldn't notice.

Again, he failed.

Annie noticed the absurd smell immediately.

Again she said ""Max, get out of here i said!""

Again Max didn't bat an eye and just stayed there.

Bart, again relieved that he got away because of his now best friend Max, is... well about to fart again.

This fart was one of those ""big ones"" you know the one the you know is gonna be bad... like really bad

He tried to hold it in, his face began to turn red, he sweated a lot, he was like having this spiritual battle... with his fart.

And then alas, he failed.

The fart came out in all of it's glory, probably filling the whole room!

Now Annie was full of it, she couldn't stand it, Max had to go.

Annie stood up and said ""Max! If you don't get out of here right now you're gonna get shat on!""",Farty Bart,3

The manager is shocked even further but decides to give the man a chance. The man sits at the piano, flexes his fingers and launches into a hauntingly beautiful and delicate ballad in a minor key. Playing from one end of the keyboard to the other effortlessly.

As the final chord dies away the manager asks ""That was amazing, what's it called?""

""'Fuck my greasy knobhole and call me Susan.'"" The man responds ""Composed it my shitting self didn't I.""

The manager is a bit perplexed but asks if he knows anything else, before he has finished asking the question the man has begun a melancholy blues number that could make a grown man cry.

""This one's called 'The crusty shit on your hairy sphincter is making me fucking horny'""

""Anything else dare I ask?"" The manager tentatively offers.

This time it's a funky jazz number that any normal pianist would need 3 hands to play.

""Something else I did my fucking self, it's called 'My filthy slutbox needs a...'""

The manager throws up his hands and says ""Ok, that's enough, I get the idea.... Well... You are an extraordinarily talented pianist. You can have the job but you must not introduce any of your songs or talk to any of the customers.""

After a few weeks into the job, the pianist notices across the restaurant an absolutely stunning blond, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen in his life and she's dressed to kill. After a while he can no longer take it, stops playing mid-chord and rushes to the men's room to satisfy his urge. He beats his meat harder than he's done since he was a teenager, as he approaches the vinegar strokes of climax he hears the manager beating on the door and shouting his name to get back on the piano and do what he's paid to do.

But it's too late, he cums like a racehorse, quickly pulls his trousers back up and runs back into the dining room. He's just sat back down and smoothing his hair back when a patron taps him on the shoulder and says ""Excuse me, do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and dripping spunk onto your shoes?""

""Know it!?"" The pianist says, ""I fucking wrote it!""",The one about the rude pianist,8

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have

raised, the administration rejects your request for the following

reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You do not work 8 hours straight.
2. You fall asleep after brief work periods. 
3. You do not always follow the orders of the management team.
4. You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.
5. You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.
6. You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.
7. You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing.
8. You will retire well before you are 65. 
9. You are unable to work double shifts.
10. You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed the assigned task.
11. As if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.",Request from a worried P*nis,100

A man is in his doctor's office for his annual physical exam.  All the tests have been run and the doctor has given him a clean bill of health.  The doctor asks, ""Are you having any problems that you'd like to tell me about?""

""Well, there is one thing,'' says the man.  ""It's of a sexual nature.""

The doctor says ""Are you having problems performing?""

The man replies, ""No, it's kind of the opposite.  I just love sex with my wife so much that I have a tendency to finish too quickly.""

The doctor says, ""Well, there are all kinds of tests we can run to get to the root cause of the problem but I tend to go for quick and cheap to begin with on a matter like this.  When you leave here, stop at a sporting goods store and buy a starter's pistol.  Put it on the night table and when you feel that you're beginning to lose control, just reach over and pull the trigger on that starter's pistol.  It's loud enough that it will startle you, breaking your concentration and allowing you to continue.""

The next day the man shows up in the doctor's office looking dejected.  The doctor asks him what the problem is and the man says, ""Well Doc, I did just like you said. I bought a starter's pistol on the way home.  When I got there my wife was already in bed so I put the starter's pistol on the bed table and jumped in bed with her.  We were having a VERY good time, had some sixty nine action going on when I felt I was losing control.  So I reached over and pulled the trigger on that pistol.  It not only startled me and stopped me from finishing but it startled my wife so much that she peed in my face and practically bit my dick off.  Then my next door neighbor came out of the bedroom closet naked, with his hands in the air""",A visit to the doctor,63

She goes to the doctors, and they tell her it's a sinus issue. Another month goes by and she sees her Dr. again, and they do more blood work on her, and it's discovered to be temporal arteritis.  Which is basically enlarged arteries of the brain.

They performed a sed rate test on her blood and it comes back really high.  The drs. were flabbergasted by this.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody under 50 is supposed to get this, my GF was 48 at the time.  So based upon these tests, the dr. decides to give her HIGH dosages of steroids. It's been years.  I forget how high it was. But it was a crazy amount because of how bad her blood work was showing.

The Drs.  informed her that because of the high dosage of steroids, that she may experience some side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

After a month of dealing with the steroids, my GF called her Dr. to complain about those side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor asked what is she experiencing...

My GF said that she's noticed two major problems from the steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor asked what was the first item, and my GF mentioned that she's getting a lot of hair on her chest.

The doctor asked how far does it go down...

My GF replied, ""Down to my balls, and that the other problem!!""",My girlfriends health,4

And so the tribe's Chieftain then offers them a chance, that is, if they can complete two certain tasks.  


Chieftain: For the first task, I want the three of you to each bring 10 pieces of fruit. It can be any fruit, as long as there are ten of them.

John: Sounds fine. What about the second one?  


Chieftain: After you complete the first, then I'll tell you the second one. I'll have you know that if any of you tries to escape, you will be killed on the spot. Now go and bring me those fruits.

&amp;#x200B;

And so the three of them went their separate ways to search.

After 40 minutes, Dave was the first one to come back, bringing ten pieces of oranges with him.

Dave: It seems like I'm the only one here. So what about the other task?

Chief: Hmm, oranges. Alright, for the second task, I want you to insert all of the fruits into your butt without showing any kind of emotions. If I see any changes to your facial expression then you will be beheaded immediately.

Without any other choices, Dave pulled down his pants then proceeds to insert the orange.  
Only halfway through the first orange and Dave squeaked silently. Then ""boom"", his head was immediately chopped off.  


Next to arrive was Peter, bringing ten pieces of grapes with him. So the chief explains the second task, telling him that if he shows any kind of emotion, he's dead. 

Thinking that he was fortunate with what he brought, Peter proceeds in inserting the grapes into his butt. Handling the first one smoothly, then the second, the third, fourth, fifth, all without batting an eye. But as he was about to insert the last grape, he suddenly laughed a little bit, then ""boom"", head rolling on the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

And so Dave and Peter met outside the gates of heaven and started talking about what happened.

Dave: Oh man, I saw what happened up here. You were very close, there was only one left. It looked like you were having no problems with the grapes. 

Peter: Oh yeah. It was very easy, I could have inserted upto 20 pieces.

Dave: Then why the fuck did you laughed? Now you're dead too. I hope John is doing well.

Peter: That's the thing. As I was about to insert the final grape, I saw that stupid shit coming back, dragging 10 fuckin' Jackfruits with him!!","Dave, Peter, and John were captured by a tribe as they were hunting treasures deep in the forests of Brazil.",20
