They were considered the heads of each village, and helped out in the daily governing. 

Well, the scribe of one of the villages had grown quite old, and was too tired to help every day. He got himself a helper, who functioned just like a substitute teacher in schools. Whenever the scribe was too worn out to be of use, he would send a message with his granddaughter, and the sub would do the tasks of the day.

The sub loved his job. Every morning he would sit by his window and try to listen and see if he would be given the tasks for the day. He was a hard-worker, and was pleased when the scribe gave him more and more important tasks to do. He dreamed of taking over position as head scribe one day, and serving his people. 

However, there was one task the sub was dreading. Every year after the harvest the villagers would gather for a feast, and the centerpiece was always a massive pie. It was considered a very holy pie, for it was full of shit. The scribe’s shit.

Yes, once a year the scribe would shit in a pie, and it would be devoured by the village people. They felt this was the way to absorb all the knowledge amassed by the scribe.

The sub was terrified of doing this. What if he couldn’t shit enough to fill a full pie? What if nothing came out at all? As his tasks grew more and more complex, he knew that the inevitable was soon to be upon him.

The day of the festival came, and the sub sat by his window, trembling all over. Then he heard the scribe say those cursed words, the words he had been dreading for years: 

“Sub-scribe to poo the pie.” ","A long time ago, every village used to have its own scribe.",48

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. 
Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. 
In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! 
Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. 
Love, your son, Joshua.

One day, Ving tells me he wants to change his name to ""Lee"". He thinks it'll help him fit in more, as it's a more American name. Ling, who's proud of her heritage and traditional to a fault, is vehemently against this, and tries everything she can think of to talk him out of it. Ving won't be moved, and asks me to drive him to city hall so he can take care of the process. Always supportive, I agree, and Ling decides to go along as well, hoping to get one last shot at talking him out of abandoning their roots.

We get to city hall, and Ling's still trying, practically pleading with Ving to reconsider. He won't give up, and remains adamant all the way to the front of the line. He gets the proper paperwork from the receptionist, and starts filling it out. In a last ditch effort, Ling asks her brother ""What would our father think?""

Something in that strikes a cord with Ving, and he relents, saying he'll keep his birthname. He returns the paperwork to the receptionist, who tells him there's a $20 fee for cancelling the process. Ling is so ecstatic she offers to pay the fee for him, pulling out her wallet.

The look of disappointment on my close friend's face just breaks my heart, and I call out to the two of them:

""Don't stop! Be Lee, Ving! Hold on to that fee, Ling!""",I know a pair of Chinese-American Twins,15

post,atdmpl,2qh72,jokes,false,1550813481,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/atdmpl/hindsight/,self.jokes,,"A husband and wife were living in Colorado. He enjoyed outdoor activities and loved going snow skiing in the wintertime. She was a bit of a homebody and preferred a quiet afternoon with a book.

One weekend in February, after a few hours of pleading, the husband convinced his wife to drive up to the mountain and go skiing with him. They loaded up the car and made their way up. When they reached the slopes, the wife had a little trouble getting going, as she'd never been skiing before. After a few runs on the bunny hill, they went up the main chairlift to try some of the bigger runs.

It was a clear day, and the mountain landscape was so beautiful that the wife was really enjoying herself. The two were having a lovely time, going back up the main chairlift and the upper chairlifts several times to even try out a couple of the tougher, steeper slopes.

It was after they'd gotten off the highest chairlift that the wife suddenly realized she desperately needed to pee. The lodge was quite a bit of skiing away down the mountain, and so her husband suggested that she go into a group of huge evergreens to the side of the chairlift to relieve herself.

""All right,"" the wife said, and skied cautiously into the trees while her husband waited for her to do her business.

She was just barely holding it in now, and as soon as she was out of sight she crouched, dropped her snow pants and went, not stopping to remove her boots from her skis.

She suddenly realized that she'd forgotten to angle her skis sideways and was now sliding backwards.

The woman panicked and tried to grab onto a nearby tree, but lost her balance and tangled her skis, sending her careening out of the trees and out onto the slope, gaining speed down the hill, directly underneath the chairlift.

""Help!"" she screamed as she struggled to cover up the essentials while she sped backwards. Her husband was up the hill, and hurried to help, but he was too late.

The woman dug into the snow with her arms, but her efforts were in vain. Her run came to an end when she finally ran into a tree on the other side of the slope and came to a halt, hideously breaking her arm in the process.

Several hours later, after ski patrol had gotten her off the mountain and to the nearest hospital, she was sitting in a bed with a cast and various bandages when another patient was rolled in next to her. He had nasty comminuted fractures in both legs and could hardly move, but he was cheery and talkative despite his injury.

They chatted for a few minutes before the woman asked;

""So how did you break your legs?""

""Well,"" the man said, ""It was the strangest thing! See, I went skiing this afternoon, riding the chairlift up, and suddenly I look down and see this woman come flying out of the trees backwards, with her pants down! I was shocked, and I started laughing uncontrollably. I didn't mean to, but it was so ridiculous. I couldn't stop and lost my balance just as the lift swayed, and I fell off the lift! It was awful. My left leg fractured in three places, and my right in five, but I would've taken that rather than be the person who slid out with their pants down!""

The man shook his head, still in disbelief at what he'd seen, before asking;

""So, how'd you break your arm?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had been talking to the father, a really nice guy in his 40s, like me, when he told me that he actually worked as the professor of logic at the local university. I was particularly interested as I didn't realise that was even a position one could hold, so I asked him quite a bit about that position. After a while, he gave me an example:

""So, for example, I see you have a dog house in your garden, so I can assume you have a fairly large house?""

""Yeah, I guess,""

""And because you have a large house, I can assume that you have children and a family, would you agree?""

""Yep, that does make sense.""

""So finally, because you have a family, it is safe for me to say that you are, in fact, a heterosexual.""

He said this in quite a grandiose way, as he clearly was quite proud of his logic, and to be fair, seeing the inner workings of the mind of a professor of logic was quite impressive, and I felt rather empowered as a result.

A few days pass, and I am dropping my kids at school, but because the school hasn't officially  opened, I had to sit next to a few of my youngest daughter's parents as I wait, whom I only really know by name. We talked for a bit, about the usual, fairly mundane things: the road works on the infamous ""Palm tree roundabout"" were almost complete and the new "" Greens superstore"" was almost finishef, after only five years of construction. We had both mutually recognised the boring nature of our discussion, so I thought it would be interesting to bring up my meeting with the aforementioned professor.

""Apparently he's the professor of logic at the local  university, he can work out a whole load of things based on a few simple facts, wanna here an example?""

""Sure, go on...""

""Yeah, so, um... you have a dog house at your place?""

""No...""

I thought for a bit, trying to remember what the professor had told me earlier that week:

""Are you one of those gays then?""","Some neighbours had just moved in to the house next-door so we invited them over to our house for a meal,",5

The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house--there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" 

""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" 

""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? 

""He certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his ass and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. Reached over and yanked. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he yanked a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's ass hairs. 

The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but please stop using my ass for a scoreboard!""",Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner...,75

He swam like a fish! My wife said that we should go talk to him. At first, he was standoffish, but finally, he started talking to my wife. She looked him up on facebook on the way home and he seemed very impressive.

Apparently, she decided to cold call him for me, because I came home from work and found him in my living room, the next week. This time, he was really talkative. I invited him to eat, and he laughed and said that he was starving! He ate nearly a whole bucket of KFC chicken, a container of mashed potatoes w/ gravy, and two pieces of Hershey pie.

We became instant friends and even my wife loved having him over. He was super loyal. I travel for work, and he would always tell me not to worry because he would take care of my wife while I was gone. Once, I came home early from a trip and found him sitting in a folding chair, with a bottle of water, eating a cherry toaster strudel and wearing a rob! I was terrified! I hate to say it, but I thought the worst. It turns out that my wife had a heard a noise the night before and he came over because she was scared. Lol

He was always positive and encouraging. He told us about the 40% rule and then said, if you want something, then take it! It really helped us. My wife started dressing better and taking care of herself. She would go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week for hours. It was great to see her so happy and looking good.

One night, I shared something very personal with the Seal. I admitted that we had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have a child for years. He told me that it was a mental block. He told me a few unusual things that I could try with my wife. To my surprise, she loved them. He said that I should always tell her, ""If it doesn't suck then I don't do it!"", so that she would give me oral pleasure. He said that I had to ""know"" that she would get pregnant. 40% wouldn't cut it! Then, he leaned over, looked at me with a 1,000 yard stare and said that he ""knew""  she would be pregnant soon. He walked away without another word.

When I came home the next day, he was at my house. He walked out and met me at the car and looked at me again with that crazy look and said the same thing before he left. He had stopped by, just to encourage me! Everyday, when I got home it was the same thing. He was always there just to tell me that he knew she would be pregnant. It was amazing.

Sure enough, he was right! When I found out, he was the first person that I called. He answered the phone in his normal way, ""Hoo Yah!"" and then sat silently. I told him the good news but he was silent. He just hung up. I guess he got shipped out, because we never saw him again.

My wife wanted to name our son after him, but we realized that we didn't know his name! We had always called him Seal! My son, now 15, is the strongest kid in his school and captain of the swim team. I honestly believe that he wouldn't be here today, if Seal hadn't came along to help us.  That has been many years ago, but my wife still talks about Seal almost everyday.",I saw a navy SEAL swimming at the pool once.,0

Everyone in the second room was standing on their heads on concrete. The man thought that was even worse to spend the rest of eternity on his head on an even harder floor.

Finally the devil takes him to the third door and in that room everyone is up to their knees in shit and drinking coffee.

So on the 11th of February, she spoke to the two lovestruck rivals and challenged them.

""On Valentine's Day, each of you will get me a card - no gift, only a card. The one who gets me the card I like the most, will become my lover.""

Both the boys agreed to the challenge, but Joel was especially confident - he was quite artsy and a brilliant raconteur.

So using his last few dollars, he bought art supplies and got to work making the best card ever. He toiled through the deepest hours of the next two days until he made the best card ever: it was gorgeously decorated with the most beautiful poem.

On Valentine's morning, the boys both presented their cards to Gianna, who said she will send an individual letter by tomorrow morning telling them who is the victor.

Joel was up from the early morning on the 15th, finding Gianna's letter under the front door. The letter wasn't the good news he was expecting: Gianna had chosen Nathan.

Joel, sad and angry, confronted Gianna. Trying to control his rage, he burst into tears asking Gianna:

""Oh my dear Gianna, how I love you so, but did you not love how beautiful my card was?""

""It was indeed beautiful, Joel."" Gianna replied.

""Was my poetry not good?"" Joel sobbed.

""I loved the poem, Joel."" Gianna replied.

""Well I know it was better than Nathan's card. I bet he didn't even have as many words on his than mine!"" Exclaimed a now-irate Joel

""You're right Joel,"" Gianna replied. ""In fact his only had two words - and they won me over.""

Joel, in combined anger and intrigue, asked:

""WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE TWO WORDS ANYWAY?""

Gianna came up to his ear and whispered:

""American Express.""","Gianna, a beautiful woman, was in the midst of a love triangle with two best friends, Nathan and Joel",12

The eyes pointed out that they were the ones who saw everything, including whatever objectives the brain was going to decide to pursue, so they should be in charge.  

The arsehole tried to say something at this point but was interrupted:  

The ears said that they should be in charge because not even the eyes could look in all directions at once, whereas the ears were vigilant no matter which way the body was facing, and could even warn of danger when the eyes were shut.  

The heart said this was all very well, but without the tireless work it did in bringing blood to all parts of the body neither the brain nor the eyes nor the ears would last half a minute, so the heart should be in charge.  

Again the arsehole started to speak but was shouted down.   

The stomach pointed out that it had to process food before the heart would have anything worth carrying around, so it ought to be in charge.  

The hands said that they were the ones responsible for picking up whatever the brain decided on and the eyes saw, and without them the stomach would never get anything, so they should be in charge.  

The legs commented that they were the ones actually responsible for taking the body from place to place, so they ought to be in charge.   

The arsehole made a final attempt to put its case, but everyone else told it to piss off and shut the fuck up.  

This upset the arsehole so it decided to go on strike and see how everyone else liked it. Pretty soon the brain was feeling faint, the eyes had spots before them, the ears were ringing, the heart was fluttering, the stomach was queasy, the hands were clammy and the legs were wobbly. They all asked the arsehole very politely to get back to work, but the arsehole said that they'd had their chance to be nice about it and there was no way it was going back to work unless it could be in charge. And while the other parts of the body tried to hold out, it soon became clear that unless the arsehole got its way things were going to just get worse and worse, so eventually there was nothing for it but to give in.   

And from that day to this, whenever there is a body or organisation of any sort, there's always an arsehole in charge.","In the beginning, when Man was first created, all the members of the body held a meeting to decide who should be in charge.",190

They land in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, ""Greetings, Earthling.  
We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.

Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace.   
Take us to your leader or I will fire!""

The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  
'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien.  
He aimed his weapon  and opened fire.  
There was a huge explosion.  
A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien.  
'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his dick over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'",So two aliens find their way to earth,308

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""

When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""

Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.

Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Do not fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""","One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story that has a moral.",26

He approaches the room where the food is being served and he can already smell the delicious food. He arrives and sees that there is a big line at all the tables. He first gets in line for turkey because he loves turkey and wants to make sure he gets a full helping. He waits and waits in the line as his mouth waters. After what seems like forever he gets to the table where they pile the meat on his plate. He's so hungry he can't help himself so he starts downing the turkey. Dark meat first cuz that's his favorite. 

He then goes to the stuffing line as he continues to eat his turkey. He finishes it well before he gets to the front of the line so now he's standing there, mouth watering again for what feels like forever. He waits and waits and finally gets a big scoop of stuffing. Just like before he starts stuffing his face with the stuffing. 

He moves on to the mashed potatoes and again, his plate is empty as he waits because he just can't help himself with all this delicious food that reminds him of his grandma's cooking. He stands there in this line that seems to never end. Finally he gets a large dollop of mashed potatoes and drenches it in gravy. He eats it down in record speed. 

He thinks to himself, ""All this food is making me thirsty!"" He sees the table where there is a big bowl of a red, fruity drink. He walks up to the table pours a big glass and chugs it down. He pours another glass and again it's gone in seconds. The man is happy as can be with a big red smile. That's the end of the story, there was no punch line.

After much deliberation, and many ideas like,

Reform the educational system.

Invest in small independent businesses,

Offer free gym memberships and reduce the cost of fresh produce, so that people can afford fresh meals. 

Put National health services stock out to tender instead of paying the highest price for medical supplies 

More funding for the public services, so the police can deploy more officers, the N.H.S isn't as underfunded and lacking of staff as it is. and the fire brigade can expand.


They mull this over for several hours all in agreement something needs to change.

After they each vote, by writing down  a list of things that could be brought in.

The ballet counters notice only two words on every piece of paper, 

Puzzled his job is to only count so he thinks no more of it.


The next day the votes are in and they all assemble.

The speaker of the house addresses them all and says,
""The votes are in and you all for once unanimously agreed on one thing"" 

""All of you only wrote one thing even though we asked for a list"" 

""But the vote is the vote"" 

""And will be passed"" 


""Unanimously the vote is""

He's going out on a business trip and his mother is in hospital for a car accident, so the child has to stay with his uncle for a while. His uncle is a farmer, and so the boy arrives on the farm. He's only allowed to bring what he can carry, as well as his pet cat. So, he meets with his uncle and despite being a rather harsh man due to his work, he's well meaning. Not to mention, he seems to be quite a fan of cats ever since his wife met an unfortunate end at the hoof of one of the farms horses.

So the boy is going to bed, and he lets the cat out for the night. A few hours later, he wakes to the sound of screaming.


He comes outside and his uncle is running about absolutely swamped in baby chicks and kittens. They seemed to have just sprung up overnight. Hes trying to herd them all into a small, boxed off area but its so damn difficult while trying not to hurt them. The boy, naturally confused, asks what happened.
The farmer replies ""Your cat got into the chickens roost"", to which the boy replies ""Yea, so what?"". His uncle promptly shoots back, ""haven't your parents told you what happens when you leave a pussy and a cock alone in a house overnight?""","A boy, his uncle, and a cat on a farm.",10

A group of people evacuating stop by his house in a big pickup truck.

“Hop in and we can all get out of here together.”

The man refuses to leave.
“My god will save me,” is all he replies.

A few days later the waters have risen several feet and the man is forced to live on the second floor of his house to avoid the flood waters.

A rescue boat searching for survivors spots him sitting by his window and they boat over.

“Hop in and we can all get out of here together.”

Still the man refuses to leave.
“My god will save me,” is all he said.

A day later and the waters have risen and driven the man to seek refuge on his roof.

A coast guard helicopter surveying the damage notices him sitting on the roof and flys in to save him. A coast guard worker is lowered on the rope and offers to harness the man up.

“Hop in and we can all get out of here together.”

The man refuses again.
“My god will save me,” is all he says.

Another day later and the waters have risen over the top of his house. The man is swept away by the current and drowns.

At the gates of heaven the man sees god. He asks him, “God, I showed great faith in you. Why didn’t you rescue me?”

God replies, “I sent you a pickup truck, a rescue boat and a helicopter. What more do you want from me?”",My god will save me,55

Then the abdomen looked at him and said ""I think it may be your knees.  They have stopped bending, and your legs have become stiff."" ""Why have you done this, knees?"" Shouted the ant.  But there was no reply, so he shouted again.  ""Knees!? Why have you stopped bending and prevented me from walking?  I must be going now.  The colony needs food and I must complete me duty!""

The rules were simple: people would gather into small groups of 10 or 20 people and simply beat the living hell out of each other until everyone was either knocked out or dropped out. 

Now this really was never my thing, but for some people it was a blast. This place always had hoards of people; every year would draw a bigger and bigger crowd. At its peak it drew something like 50,000 people from all around the world.

Now it was about this time the hosts of the event realized they could be making some serious money off this event. Up until now they had been running it almost out of the goodness of their own hearts. They barely charged entry fees, just high enough to cover the venue and charges for cleanup. Anything left over would be given as prize money to the victor. But there was serious money to be made, so up the costs went.

The next year drew a much smaller audience. No one wanted to pay the absurd costs. Well, management had no idea how to react. They wanted to keep the money, but they had to find a way to pull in the crowds. So they came to a conclusion: ""maybe people arent showing up because it's too violent?""

The next year brought boxing gloves, padding, and all the bells and whistles of a ""safe"" fight. Of course this brought even fewer people. No one wants some wimpy, pathetic fight. 

Now by this point things were getting desperate. Management could no longer afford the venue, and had to schedule it outside in a small ring. 

This brought with it new rules. People would now be required to gather into a long line. 2 people would enter the ring, and they would beat and hit each other until one person tapped out. But with all the gear they had to wear they were basically limited to these weak little punches. Fights could go on for hours if no one stopped them. 

I think this is where the event finally fell. Over the last few years the lines would grow shorter and shorter. No one was willing to participate. 

I went during its final year, just to see what it was like. It was empty. Literally no one had come. Such an amazing event had become a joke. 

And unfortunately, this joke had no punch line. ",Street fighting,2

""The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need, a new suit."" He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see, size 44 long?"" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure!"". The salesman eyed Joe, then said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck."". Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"". Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see, nine-and-a-half?"" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure, why not."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see, size 36."" Joe laughed smugly, ""No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The shocked salesman shook his head, ""You can't possibly wear a size 34!

James and Jane were laughing at the jokes and having a good time. They looked at Jenny and to their surprise, Jenny was laughing too.

As the jokes went on, the comedian told the same joke twice. James was confused and wondered if the comedian had already forgotten that they had told the same joke already. James nudged Jenny: ""Haven't we heard that joke already?"" Suddenly, the entire audience stood up, pointed to James, and said ""Found the anti-vaxxer!"" And they threw James out.

After 30 minutes, it became clear that the comedy consisted of nothing but repeats. After the 10th repetition of a particularly bad joke, Jane groaned. The entire audience stood up, pointed to Jane, and said ""Found the anti-vaxxer!"" And they threw Jane out.

James and Jane stood outside the comedy bar, wondering why they were thrown out even though they were pro-vax. They needed to take Jenny home, but she was still inside. That's okay, they said, because they will eventually throw Jenny out because she is actually anti-vax.

3 hours later, the bar finally closed, and Jenny came out with the owner of the bar. Asking the speaker why they didn't throw Jenny out, the speaker replied ""Why should I throw her out? She's alright. She laughed the hardest out of all of the audience. She's one of us."" Jenny replied: ""I was laughing at you, not with you.""

He swears he doesn't have it and nods towards an older lady who may not have had all her peas in her pod... I see her putting 10 bucks in her wallet. So I wave to her and I said sorry excuse me that's actually my 10 bucks I just dropped it. She looks at me deadpan and says nope sorry it's mine. I found it. It's mine. And she just turns around. 

Now obviously I'm not going to beat up a slow old lady for 10 bucks... But I kinda wanted it back. And there's no way I'm calling the cops but man I'm annoyed. I decide to let it go and we walk out to the parking lot only to discover that she's parked 2 cars away... We sit in the car and Im like man what the fuck I want my 10 bucks but Jesus christ. 

My friend tells me I need to go and grab a grocery bag out of her cart and tell her I found it it's mine! And I'm like nah no way man if she called the cops I'd lose my job!! He says too bad you gotta do something. Bet on it? I said fuck it fine. He says we each call out a number 1 to 10 if it's the same number you go. I'm like fine whatever. We both yell out a number on the count of 3 and fuck off do we not say 7... So anyways i get out of the car cause now I sort of have to and I walk over to her cart and pick up a small bag on the top, smaller part of the cart. I'm sitting there holding it waiting for her to turn around but she's rummaging through her car for some time and now I feel like an awkward idiot so I run back to my car and throw the bag in my friend's lap and drive the fuck out of there. 

A few minutes later I realize how fucking stupid what I just did was... I nicked an old lady's groceries over 10 dollars... We feel guilty so we turn back around to give it back and apologize. Well are there not 2 cruisers with their lights flashing, talking to the lady who's absolutely exasperated pointing and yelling and calling the cashier over...

An extremely large, muscular woman, wearing a sleeveless sundress, walked into a bar.

""Which of you men will buy a lady a drink?""

 The bar went silent as the patrons tried to ignore her. 

At the end of the bar, was Boudreaux, a skinny little Cajun, who was as usual, VERY drunk. 

Boudreaux slammed his hand on the bar and said, ""Give dat Ballerina a drink!""

 Thibodeaux, the bartender, a close friend of Boudreaux's, poured the drink and the woman chugged it down. 

She turned again to the patrons and pointed around at all of them, again revealing her hairy armpit, and asked, 

""Which of you men will buy a lady a drink?"" 

Once again, Boudreaux slapped his hand down on the bar and said, 

""Give dat Ballerina anudder drink!"" 

Thibodeaux, finally approached Boudreaux and said, 

""Boudreaux mah fren', I know it ain't none of my business of course if you want to buy dat lady a drink, but how come you keep callin' her a Ballerina?""

“Oh, I see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“Well, I’d like to,” said St Peter, “But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.


As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”

The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”

Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”","An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her.",506

The man entered the house and saw his wife making an omelette. He told her ""You're supposed to use butter, not oil."" Immediately the wife slapped him and said ""Who's cooking? Me or or you?""

The man went up to the second story and saw his son playing a video game. He told him ""You're doing it wrong, you're supposed to-"" but the son slapped him, saying ""Who's playing? Me or you?""

Then he went to the third story and saw his daughter doing homework, and told her ""this is the wrong answer"" and the daughter slapped him, saying ""Who's doing homework? Me or you?""

Finally, the man went up to the fourth story. (At this point, hopefully your listener would say ""but you said there were only 3 stories!"" at which point you slap him/her and say ""Who's telling the joke? Me or you?"")

Try as he might every time he asks for their orders they all speak at once and it’s impossible to guess. What’s more many of them seem to be highly specific and personalised. 

After many failed attempts it is late at night, well past closing and so he finally gives up and leaves, with them still waiting for food.
Angered by the way they had belittled him for his constant “mistakes” he decides to calm himself down with a nice stiff drink of vodka and a round of golf.

A little later the policemen emerge from the cafe, start cruising around town and see him playing. They all decide it would be funny to go over to start harassing him for not serving them.

 While a few of them start beating him up, one of them starts flicking his cigarette ends at the man, unfortunately causing the waiters sleeve to burst into flame.

Screaming in pain he tries to get them to call an ambulance, but shocked by the situation they try to flee the scene.
Chasing after them back to where they had parked. 

Getting into the car they drive away, colliding with the man so hard as he tried to stop them that he flies strait through the windscreen. 

Still burning the man says that they please must help him otherwise the entire car will burst into flames killing everyone in it. With this the policemen all take out there guns and kill the man.

After reading the report of the incident all of the officers involved were given a promotion for apprehending such a dangerous criminal as after all:

 He refused to comply with police orders and was found driving under the influence. Not only this but he was involved in a viscous assault, followed by a police chase ending in a serious collision. Next he was observed breaking and entering into police property and had to be ended after threatening police with a fire arm.

post,asn2qe,2qh72,jokes,false,1550660689,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/asn2qe/help_needed/,self.jokes,,"I need some advice on a pretty serious decision.

I've suspected for some time now that my girlfriend has been having an affair. There have been a few signs which I think I may be taking the wrong way and wouldn't like to falsely accuse her, but the number of these little warning flags keeps increasing. She is constantly on her phone day and night, If she is not on it, it is in her hand or zipped up in her handbag which always goes with her. She may even be faking using the toilet as I am sure I have heard her having conversations in there. She started going out ""with the girls"" a lot recently although when I ask which girls it is always ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them"" or other such pass off lines.

I offer to pick her up but there is always an excuse and she gets a taxi. Ive always looked out for her ride coming home (which is getting later each time) but she always walks from around the corner, I can usually hear a car driving off as she walks towards our house. But if it really is a taxi, why not just get dropped off in front of the house?

Recently, I picked her iPhone up just to see what time it was and she went mental at me. screaming that I should never touch her phone again, and accused me of checking up on her.

Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my girlfriend. I think deep down I just don't want to know the truth but last night she went out again and I decided to brave it and check on her when she got home. I decided I was going to hide behind my car on the street which would give me a view of the junction that she gets dropped at so I could see which car she was getting out of and who she was with. It was around 2:30 am when she pulled up. As I turned to look, I placed my hand on the car (onto a small patch of rust which is forming on the edge of the rear light enclosure) and watched her leave her taxi in which she was alone.

The question is, should I worry about this rust spot? Can I fix it myself? or should I take it to a garage?",Help needed!,8

Hundreds of guests filled his enormous abode to mingle and drink with glee. During the festivities the rich man gathered everyone to the backyard.

“Come! I have something to show you all! As well as a challenge!”

His curious (also drunk) flock followed him out to what appeared to be a huge swimming pool filled with live alligators.

“What is the meaning of this?!” Exclaimed one man

The rich man replied. “I have so much wealth that I do not know what to do with it. I have more money than one man could ever hope to spend. Alas I am bored!”

“This is my 80 foot pool and it holds one hundred hungry alligators!” He proudly proclaimed.

“I am prepared to pay a cash prize of $10,000,000 to anyone who can swim from one side to the other without being harmed!”

His audience fell silent. No one was crazy (or drunk enough) to attempt such a feat.

“You’re a madman!” One guest bellowed out.
“A fools errand to be sure!” Another one shouted

“Yes, yes, I suppose you’re right.” The rich man nodded
.
“ I did not expect anyone to be willing to throw away their life for mere dollars. Back inside I suppose”

Just as the rich man and all of his guests are heading back inside the mansion, he hears a loud SPLASH.

“Out of my way!” He yelled, as he pushed his way through the crowd back to the pool.

Much to his surprise and disbelief, he sees a young man swimming for his life across the gator infested pool! The young man narrowly makes it to the other side safe and unharmed, climbs out of the water, doubles over hands on knees and begins to breath heavily. The rich man rushes over to him.

“Are you insane?! He shrieks.
“You could have died! Why would you even attempt such a stunt?! I mean the money is no problem, I’ll deliver it to you at once however, I must know what made you go for it? I’ve never seen anyone swim that fast in my life!”

A joke is something funny because unpredicatable that makes people laugh, giggle or smile. This is a a joke :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I met a shepherd, we talked about ewe.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that it takes a second to realize that ""we talked about ewe""  sounds like the well known sentence that rings a bell in your head ""we talked about you"", makes your brain uncomfortable because the concepts mismatch. The result is a good laugh (or again, maybe just a giggle).

# Meta-joke

A meta-joke is a joke *about* jokes. It should still be as funny as a joke, but includes the concept of someone telling a joke. For instance:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jim's friend tells him:  
&gt;  
&gt;""I have a joke for you: how many eggs can you eat in the morning, on an empty stomach?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't know"", answers Jim, ""I'd say a dozen"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""No, just one!"" answers his friend. ""After that, you're not on an empty stomach anymore!""
