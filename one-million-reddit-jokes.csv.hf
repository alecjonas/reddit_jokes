The fortune teller nodded and peered into her crystal ball. It lit up with various colors and different intensities  of light then by the end, sudden darkness. Her expression all the while changed from surprise to fascination to sadness. This made the man anxious to say the least.

""So? What did it you see?""

""Well, right now you have two paths you may take. One good and one bad.""

""What are they specifically?""

""The bad path puts you on a lonesome road. It is filled with sadness and you will soon fade from the minds of many people. You will not be recognized nor will you garner any riches, be it gold and other riches.""

""And the good?""

""The good path will make you great and well known among many. You will be ahead of everyone else and the numbers will flow to you, they will be on your side. But..."" The fortune teller stops and peers back into the crystal ball which flickered.

""But what? It already sounds great, I'd choose that in a heartbeat, so what more is there?"" Asked the man who got excited but became nervous once again.

""All this fame and fortune will lead this to become the worst thing which everybody hates and despises."" The crystal ball suddenly became as black as can be.

*Newton*

Newton raises his eyes in a mixture of confusion and surprise. How the hell did that coincidence happen? Why was his name printed on that fortune cookie sheet?  He finishes his meal, the thought still on his mind. He then goes to see the chef to ask what's going on. The chef replies that he has no idea and that it must just be a mistake.

Newton forgets about the matter entirely and goes home. Several weeks later, he comes again to dine again at the Chinese restaurant, since he's gotten a bit tired of pizza. He orders a fortune cookie and some noodles. When he opens the fortune cookie, however, this odd sight greets him inside.

*Newton, but*

Now the memories of his previous visit come flooding back. It can't be a coincidence this time, surely...but the chef still insists that it must be a coincidence. He gives up, and goes home.

Months later, the man is out on a date, and he stops at the restaurant again. They both go in. He just orders noodles this time but his date orders a fortune cookie. When the cookie arrives, she opens it and gasps. She immediately shows it to the man, who almost snaps at the sight of the contents.

*Newton, but where's*

The chef still denies that this is being done on purpose, of course, and the man gives up and instead decides to treat his date to some Italian food instead. After that, the date goes splendidly. they both strike it off and they start dating more often. Some months after that, the man proposes to her and she accepts. Then a year later, the wedding is about to be held. Both the man and his wife feel like the happiest people on earth. Their union as man and wife is done and they embrace each other in a passionate kiss. After that, a grand dinner is held, but the man recognises one of the caterers there. 

""Hey, aren't you the guy at that one Chinese restaurant?"", he asks. ""Yes, sir, but unfortunately it closed down a month back, so I have become a caterer for this place"", he replies. 

The man raises his eyebrows, remembering the entire fortune cookie thing. ""Say, that whole fortune cookie thing was just a coincidence, right?"" The chef nods. ""Of course, sir! If you'd like, I can make you one right now to prove it!""

The man reluctantly agrees, and at the end of the dinner the fortune cookie arrives. He slowly opens it, trying to remember the contents of the previous ones. ""Newton, but where's""...something? Where's what? A wife, perhaps? Was this just fate's way of foreshadowing his marriage today? Of course...he gives a contented smile thinking about it. It all makes sense. Maybe he shouldn't have gotten so upset over it after all. He breaks open the fortune cookie finally, and reads it out loud in his excitement.

It was a happy but isolated existence, so it came as a bit of a shock when eldest son Niel announced that he was off to seek his fortune amongst the bright lights of London. His parents tried to dissuade him but he was focussed on this particular dream and one day in early May he duly set off after a tearful farewell to his family. All they knew was that he would be heading for London WC5 and would be writing back with news and details.  


The Summer came and went in that idyllic but changeable area of Kerry. As Autumn approached there had still been no word from young Niel and his parents were worried sick. When the local Publican, Jack, announced that he would be visiting London next week to see his brother, the Dunnes quickly persuaded him to help find out how their boy was getting on in the big City.  


Jack duly arrived at Paddington Station in London the following Tuesday armed with the information he had been give .... London WC5.  


As he strode purposefully across the concourse he noticed a sign to the right - ""WC"". He immediately made his way through the door and down the stairs where he encountered a row of small doors with numbers on.  


Consulting his notes quickly, he made his way to WC number 5 and banged fiercely on the door.  


""Are you Neally Dunne?"", he demanded.  


""Yes, but there's no paper"", came a small voice from inside.

When they get there, St. Peter greets them and tells them, ""We only have one rule here in heaven. Don't step on the ducks.""

It's almost impossible not to step on a duck there's so many, and though they try their utmost to avoid standing on them, the first guy soon accidentally steps on one.

St. Peter then appears with the ugliest woman the guy had ever seen.

St. Peter chains the woman to the guy and says to him, ""Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman!""

The next day, the second guy also accidentally steps on a duck. Once again, St. Peter shows up and with him is another extremely ugly woman. He chains the woman to the second guy saying, ""Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly woman!""

The third guy has observed all this and as he really doesn't want to be chained to an ugly woman for eternity, he's extremely careful where he steps.

Indeed, he manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day though, St.Peter appears with the most gorgeous woman the guy has ever laid eyes on. She's tall, curvaceous, tanned and extremely sexy.

Without a word, St. Peter chains the woman to the third guy.

The guy happily says to the woman, ""I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all eternity?""

A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

After some drinks and a nice dinner out, they were walking to the bus stop to go home, when they passed by a brothel. They knew both of them were virgins, so after a quick conversation, they decided that there was no better way to finish of their night of celebration than by getting laid for the very first time.

They entered the brothel, chose a girl each and headed into seperate rooms to enjoy what would likely be the best night of their life.

Despite his best efforts, the first brother was struggling to copulate with his girl. He tried it in doggy, missionary, reverse cowgirl - just about every position he could think of. But nothing seemed to work.

It didn't help that he could hear thumping and thudding from the room next door, and his brother panting and repeatedly saying ""One, two, three  ahh. One, two, three ahh"".

After about 15 minutes, he gave up trying and walked out of the room, only to see his brother leaving his room too, gasping for breath and covered in sweat.

He said him ""that was terrible. I tried everything, but I just couldn't make it work. I feel so embarrassed"".

After giving their orders, chips and dip are brought out, as is customary in Mexican restaurants. As they're snacking on that, the food is taking a while to be prepared, and the father calls the waiter over.

&amp;#x200B;

Father: ""Is our food nearly ready? We ordered about 45 minutes ago.""

Waiter: ""Sorry about that sir. We've just had a change in kitchen staff. The new cook used to be a firearms salesman, so he's pretty new to this. Again, my sincerest apologies sir. Your food will be out shortly.""

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the hungry kids are devouring the chips and dip. Pretty soon, one of the kids has a puzzled expression, and says to the mother, ""I think we're out of dip."" The mother takes a quick look and sees that there's clearly a lot of it left, so she takes a chip and tries to scoop some of it up. To her surprise, the chip breaks in two. Thinking it odd, the mother says to the father:

&amp;#x200B;

""Honey, I think there's something at the bottom of the bowl.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reaching into the dip, the father pulls out a gun of all things! Stunned, he lays it on the table and demands that a waiter come over.

&amp;#x200B;

Father: ""What the hell is wrong with you people?! Why is there a gun in my food?!""

Waiter: ""Oh my...this is quite embarrassing. Allow me to get you some fresh dip. I don't know what could've happened, sir. We'll be sure to give you a full refund on your meal.""

&amp;#x200B;

Red in the face, the waiter takes the gun and quickly runs to the kitchen. From outside, the family could hear the waiter screaming:

When he put his hat on and sat back down his friend looked at him and said. 

""That was a real nice thing for you to do.""

The other old man sighed and said.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",Only read if you’re a monk,1

Student: Then what would you call a shape that only has *two* sides?

The teacher laughs at this absurd question

Teacher: There is no such thing as a shape with only *two* sides. 

Student: Why not?

Teacher: Because it simply cannot exist.

Student: But if a shape with *five* sides can exist and a shape with *six* sides can exist then why isn't a shape with *two* sides allowed to exist?

At this point, the teacher begins to grow frustrated with this student's poor understanding of shapes

Teacher: It is geometrically impossible for a closed shape with less than three sides to exist. *Do you understand!*

Student: I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree...

The teacher has officially had it with this student

Teacher: No we most certainly will not. If something has less than three sides, then it cannot be in the form of a closed shape. And until you understand that, we are not moving on from this lesson.

He follows the woman and indeed, as he enters the room, he sees a man masturbating furiously in front of a unique 17th century Swiss grandfather clock. ""You there! Cut it out!"" he shouts. The man looks at him, but doesn't stop. ""Please, you don't understand!"" he cries out. ""It's this fetish I've got. I can only get off by ejaculating on timekeeping instruments. I know it sounds weird, but I can't help it!"" 

Carl walks towards the agitated man, and tries to calm him down. ""Hey dude, I get it, we all have our quirks. But this clock is priceless, and I'm afraid you'll damage the woodwork. So I'm gonna have to ask you to stop."" The man shakes his head. ""Come on man, I'm this close, you gotta let me have this. I'm serious, I won't leave until I have my seed on one of these devices.""

The nun said “Well let’s see what we can do about that. You must either be catholic or single”
The cab driver agreed to both excitedly saying “yes sister! I am both! Catholic and single!”

The nun told the cab driver to pull into a nearby alley and gave him a kiss and much more. 

As the cab driver pulls out he begins to cry. He exclaims “Forgive me father for I have sinned!”
The nun asked “What is the matter son? Why have you sinned and why are you crying?”

The parrot calmly stepped out onto the man's extended arm and said:

She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.

This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters.  Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing.  Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report just by listening to the bells.

Sarah's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a fine specimen but, this morning, she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all!

When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring.  He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one.

Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.

The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Piece Prize"", they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well.

Clearly old Butch was an internet service provider in the making.  Who else but an internet service provider could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on the planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?

post,9v615h,2qh72,jokes,false,1541643891,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9v615h/3_wishes/,self.jokes,,"Woman was out golfing one day when she hit the
ball into the woods.
She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog
in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I
will grant you three wishes.""
The woman freed the frog, and the frog said,
""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get ten times of it!"" The woman
said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most
beautiful woman in the world.
The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this
wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis
whom women will flock to"".
The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will
be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""
So, KAZAM-
she's the most beautiful Woman in the world!

For her second wish, she
wanted to be the richest woman in the world.
The frog said, ""That will make
your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times
richer than
you. ""
The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's
his is mine.""
So, KAZAM- she's the richest woman in the world!

The
frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like to have a
mild heart attack.""

Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't
mess with them.

Attention

She immediately turned around and headed back to the dealer.   Once there, she found her salesman and began, rather excitedly, to complain that her radio was not working, and they must replace it since she

only had one radio station.   The salesman calmed her down and told her that her car radio was voice-activated, and that she would only need to speak aloud the type of music that she wanted and the car would

find it. She got into the car and started the engine and then said the word ""country,"" and the radio changed to a station playing a Dolly Parton song.   She was satisfied and started home.  

After a while she decided to try out the radio and said ""rock 'n' roll;"" the radio station changed and a song by the Rolling Stones came from the speakers.  

Quite pleased, the woman continued driving.   A few streets from her house, another driver shot through a red light causing her to slam on her brakes to avoid a collision.   The woman angrily shouted, ""Arsehole!"" 

The radio immediately tuned in to a political broadcast from Donald Trump.........

Cheryl toiled in poverty and obscurity until one day her anger brought the sibling rivalry to a peak and she decided to attack Sara at her factory.

So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."".

""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""

""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.

That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".

""Okay."" replies the dog, ""You have nine hundred sheep.""",A farmer has 895 sheep.,2269

The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""  
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""  
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.  
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

4. Employ the vernacular.

15. Be more or less specific. 
16. Understatement is always best. 
17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement. 
18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.

""Well I hit ye as hard as I can, and then yeh hit me right back. On gentleman's agreement whoever hits the hardest is the winner."" He replies.

One day, a wise old monk was working in the monastery garden planting things of all kinds, including date seeds.

A little boy came up to the fence of the garden and asked, ""Brother, why are you planting the seeds of trees of whose fruits you shall never eat?""

Once upon a time, in a magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Sorry, I can't tell you because you're not a monk."" he said.",Here's an old legend with a new twist,5

The Devil looks at his clipboard irritably.  
 “Look, I’ve got a problem. You’re due here about now, but I’m full. I’ll have to ID one of the temporary inmates, whose sentence is just about up, and give them an early release to make room for you. Follow me.”
He leads Trump to a door marked Chamber 1.The door grinds open. There is an Olympic size pool. Thrashing around in the pool is Richard Nixon.  
Nixon dives, tries to retrieve an underwater object, misses, comes up empty handed. He must do this for years and years before is sentence is served and he can go Up There.

“I can’t swim!” protests Trump.

With a grunt, The Devil leads DT to Chamber 2.  

The door to Chamber 2 creaks open. 
In Chamber 2 is a quarry. The sun beats down. And in the quarry is a lone figure, in the person of Jimmy Carter.  
 
Carter is breaking rocks with a sledgehammer. Sweat pours off him as dust and grime adhere to his sweaty skin. 
Trump shakes his head. “Not with my arthritis,” he says, motioning toward his shoulder. Shaking his head in disgust, the Devil leads Trump to Chamber 3.  

The door to Chamber 3 swings open.  
In Chamber 3 Trump sees a door on the right and another on the left. In the middle of the chamber Bill Clinton is handcuffed to a bed. The door on the right open. And who enters Chamber 3? 
None other than…  

Monica Lewinsky !!  

Trump has to pinch himself to believe what happens next.
Ms Lewinsky offers Clinton a sultry look. 
Slips off her gown… and she is wearing nothing underneath.  
She lowers herself onto Clinton…  
And proceeds to do what Monica Lewinsky became (in-)famous for.  
Trump shifts uncomfortably.  
“Shouldn’t we leave ’em alone?” he asks. The Devil reminds Trump where they are.  
The show goes on.

Clinton’s face takes on a blissful look.  Ms Lewinsky’s head jerks back suddenly. With a grimace of utter disgust on her countenance she swallows hard. Wipes her mouth with her forearm, stands up puts her gown back on blows Clinton a kiss and a wink and exits through the door on the left.  

“That’s it?” asks Trump “Stay put,” grunts the Devil.
From behind the chamber there is the sound of a shower running, then someone brushing their teeth and gargling.  
A minute later the door on the right opens again there stands a freshly showered Monica Lewinsky.  

She once again drops her gown…and the process repeats.  
Lewinsky goes back to the shower, scrubs, gargles and reappears.
She reappears at the door on the right, and the process repeats before she exits through the doorway on the left, and the process repeats.  
 
It repeats again and yet again.  

And the process repeats, and repeats, and repeats.  
“Well?” barks the Devil at Trump.  
“Hey, Chamber 3,” answers Trump unhesitatingly.  
“Are you sure?” demands the Devil.  
“Never been surer,” beams Trump.  
In Admin, the Devil opens a drawer and produces a contract. He pricks Trump’s finger. “Sign here,” demands the Devil. Trump complies. “And here, here and here.”  Trump signs. The Devil stamps the documents, binds them and puts them into a folder, which he drops into a filing cabinet drawer.  

“Follow me,” orders the Devil.  
They return to Chamber Three.  
Clinton lies on the bed, waiting in anticipation for the next performance.  
“Miss Lewinsky!” barks the Devil.  
His voice is drowned out by the noise of the shower.  
“Miss L-E-W-I-N-S-K-Y-Y-Y!” roars the Devil  
“Coming, coming!” comes a plaintive whine from the shower.  
A minute later Monica Lewinsky enters the chamber through the door on the right. She is dressed in the gown, and is freshly showered and groomed. However she looks flustered at being rushed.  
“What’s the big hurry all of a sudden?” she complains.  
“You’re being released,” says the Devil; “your replacement has arrived.”","Trump snuffs it, and arrives at the Pearly Gates",20

So he goes to this skydiving company and says he want to go skydiving and his instructor is this old Egyptian man who used to be a paratrooper obviously very experienced so he and the tourist go through training for the 1st day and two more.

On the third day they go through the final things to do including pulling your chute. So the tourist asks “what do I do if my chute doesn’t open ?”
And the instructor says “you have a second string you can pull for a back up” and shows him on the backpack. So then the tourist asks “well what if that doesn’t work” and the instructor says “well then you’re a dead man, but I know a secret that worked for me once when I was in the military”

Then the tourist asks “and that would be ?”
“You have to cross your legs and say Allah three times with you hands clapped together”
The next day the man jumps out the plane and after a short while he pulls his first chute that doesn’t work then he pulls his second one and that doesn’t work now he’s freaking out thinking he will die. The he remembered what he was told so it was his only chance.

He quickly claps his hands and crosses his legs and says “Allah Allah Allah” and then a massive hand appears out the sky and catches him, gently it puts him down on the ground the man rejoiced, says “thank god” 
The hand then smashes him

The family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.
Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.
When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied: “I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”

“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”

The little girl replied, “I will if those assholes from Lowe’s ever deliver the damn drywall.”",On the Job Training,4

post,9utlvj,2qh72,jokes,false,1541546262,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9utlvj/the_debt_very_long/,self.jokes,,"Manoj was a mostly honest man. He had been collecting taxes for years in the small town, and even though the townsfolk cried that the king was a tyrant, Manoj collected taxes and said 'fair is fair'. Since he had been able to survive under the king's reign, he had little compassion for those who came up short on their taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, no one is perfect, and one day, Manoj heard his daughter crying that she did not own a nice dress. Something happened inside the mostly-honest man, and he made a decision, a very bad decision. That day, when he finished his collections he went to the cellar of the tax-house which shared a wall with the butcher next door, and loosened a brick enough to hide one penny where no one would find it. As soon as he finished the deed of concealing the coin, he went back to his regular, mostly honest life, and felt quite good about the fact that he would soon have enough to buy his little girl a nice dress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Noticing her father's \*joi de vivre\*, the girl asked pappa why he was so happy. He told her it just felt good to do an honest day's work, so she asked him about work. He told her and, perhaps because his mind was ever-so-slightly guilty, he mentioned how hard it was to catch people who hid money from the tax collector. She nodded and smiled and went back to playing, but the next day, after her father went to work, she followed him and observed, eventually getting distracted by the smell of fresh bread.

&amp;#x200B;

When Manoj returned home, his daughter surprised him with a cheerful smile and a proclamation:

&amp;#x200B;

""Sandhu the Tanner is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

Amazed, Manoj asked the girl how she knew, and she replied that she had gone to the bakery and climbed up to the roof, and had seen Sandhu hiding coins in a bucket behind his shop. Skeptical, but unwilling to doubt his little princess, he asked her to come to work with him the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj asked Bagrah, the deputy collector to accompany him to Sandhu's shop the next day, with his daughter following. It took only moments for Sandhu to break down and confess, and as Bagrah dragged him off to face the king's justice, he asked how they had known. Manoj's daughter pointed to the roof and said ""secret rooftop lookout"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj was stunned, but he patted her on the head and took the hidden coins back to the tax-house for record. So overwhelmed with pride, Manoj found it impossible to resist taking one of the coins and adding it to the stash behind the brick in the basement, in the cool wall which was shared with the store-room of the butcher next-door. He now had two cents!

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, Manoj's daughter greeted him with the declaration:

&amp;#x200B;

""Quimble the dyer is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

When he asked how she knew, she said she had been out walking and was distracted by flowers, but noticed that someone was hiding something in the garden behind the building.

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj and Bagrah confronted Quimble the next day and sure enough, he had been hiding taxes. When asked how he had been caught, Manoj's daughter pointed to the shelves of flowers and said ""peeking through the flowerpots""

&amp;#x200B;

As with the time before, Manoj used this discovery to add to his own stash. He now had three cents. He did notice, however, that the wall which the tax-house shared with the butcher was colder than he had remembered. Worried it might be an omen, he decided to stop stealing, but...

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, Manoj's daughter greeted him with the declaration:

&amp;#x200B;

""Gangan the porter is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

When he asked how she knew, she said she had been out walking and was distracted by the fancy guests at the hotel, and noticed that someone was hiding something under a statue.

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj and Bagrah confronted Gangan the next day and sure enough, he had been hiding taxes. When asked how he had been caught, Manoj's daughter pointed to the hotel wall and said ""hole in the wall overlooking your hiding spot""

&amp;#x200B;

As with the time before, Manoj gave in to temptation. He now had four cents. He did notice, however, that the wall which the tax-house shared with the butcher was \*even\* colder than he had remembered. Was it covered in frost? Worried it might be an omen, he decided to stop stealing, but...

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, Manoj's daughter greeted him with the declaration:

&amp;#x200B;

""Zanu the mummer is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

When he asked how she knew, she said she had been out walking and was distracted by a lovely song, and while she watched a singer she noticed that someone was hiding something in a caravan.

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj and Bagrah confronted Zanu the next day and sure enough, he had been hiding taxes. When asked how he had been caught, Manoj's daughter pointed to an alley and said ""dark alley overlooked darker crime""

&amp;#x200B;

Though this phenomenon was becoming ominous, Manoj was feeling quite proud (though, to be honest, Banghu was getting a bit jealous). Again, Manoj used this discovery to add to his own stash. He now had five cents. The wall which the tax-house shared with the butcher was actually showing signs of frost. Worried it might be an omen, he decided to stop stealing, but...

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, Manoj's daughter greeted him with the declaration:

&amp;#x200B;

""Someone the near the fountain is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

When he asked how she knew, she said she had been out walking and was distracted by the sound of the falling water, and noticed that someone was hiding something in a crack of the fountain's plaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj and Bagrah wnet to the fountain the next day and lay in wait, sure enough someone, Tata the groom, came and tried to hide more coins in the fountain. When asked how he had been caught, Manoj's daughter pointed to the other side of the fountain and said ""watery crack hiding peeker""

&amp;#x200B;

As with the time before, Manoj used this discovery to add another coin, the last one he swore to himself, to his stash (this was probably a good idea, since Bagrah was getting very jealous of Manoj's success). He now had six cents, but very ominously, the wall which the tax-house shared with the butcher had ice on it. Worried it might be an omen, he decided to stop stealing, as surely six cents was enough to buy something nice for his daughter, but...

&amp;#x200B;

The very, Manoj's daughter greeted him with the declaration:

&amp;#x200B;

""Someone else in town is hiding money from you""

&amp;#x200B;

When he asked how she knew, she said she had been out walking and was distracted by the smell of delicious food, and she saw someone hiding something.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day Manoj and Bagrah followed her to the market. They too smelled the delicious food she had spoken of. She led them past the cooking stalls to the door of the butcher's shop. When she led them inside the butcher, Grappo, greeted the girl and asked if she was back to take another ice-pop, but she said no, and walked to the back room. Manoj was suddenly very concerned, and Grappo mistook it for concern about the daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

""Mister Manoj"" he said, ""please do not worry. it is odd that a girl so young should ask to enter my ice-room, but you see, at this time of year the weather is so hot that I add so much ice to my ice-room that the basement is like a winter-palace, so I keep ice-pops there for my own children. Is it okay that I have given her one?""

&amp;#x200B;

Manoj was not the least comforted, but sensing something was off, Bagrah pressed him to follow the girl into the ice-room. They went down the stairs and Manoj's own daughter said

&amp;#x200B;

""Someone on the other side of that wall is hiding money which belongs to the king in behind the bricks""

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately realizing the explanation, Bagrah seized Manoj's arm and called him a thief. Devastated that he had been caught by his own daughter, but also confused, Manoj asked her how she came to know of the six cents he owed to the king.

&amp;#x200B;

She pointed to a small hole in the wall and said

&amp;#x200B;

They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again.

He says ""1, 3, 5, 7, 9"".

Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.

He says, ""Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen.

The truck driver watched, horrified, as dozens of nerds started walking out of the nearby woods, attracted by the computers.  Thinking quickly, he pulled a rifle out of his cab and started shooting at the nerds.

One day he decided to test how big a lie had to be before anyone believe him. So he told some people a true story. 0 people believed him. Weird. So he added a small lie to the same tale and told a few more people. Well, that time only 1 person believed him. Then he added a another small falsehood but only 1 guy bought it. So he changed the story and added a bigger lie. This time 2 people believed him. The lies kept piling on. 3 people believed his latest lies, then with more changes came more suckers! There were 5, then 8,13, 21, 34!! It spiraled out of control!

One day, the zoo's famous orangutan dies suddenly. Not wanting to close the exhibit, the zoo approaches Dave with a proposition. Dave is to dress up in a realistic orangutan suit and pretend to be the orangutan, until the zoo can secure another animal. While skeptical, Dave agrees to the idea and begins his first day as an orangutan. 

He begins by doing normal orangutan activities, until he's sure that the zoo guests do not see through his disguise. Eventually, he begins to really interact with guests through the glass to the exhibit, making faces at them and putting his hands up to theirs. The orangutan exhibit soon becomes a big hit, and every day Dave does new things to make the guests laugh. 

The orangutan exhibit is situated adjacent to the lion habitat, and one day Dave decides to top all of the funny things he's done before. He climbs up the wall that divides the habitats and begins to walk along it, taunting the lions below. A big male lion notices him and tries to jump up at him. Dave easily dodges and continues to mess with the lion. The crowd is hysterical. Dave starts hanging off the ledge, taunting the lion even more, when suddenly he slips and plummets into the lion den. Terrified, he begins screaming. 

""Help! Help! The lion is going to eat me!!!""

I was stressed out and not thinking very fondly of the Christmas season right then. It was dark, cold, and wet in the parking lot as I was loading my car up with gifts that I felt obligated to buy. I noticed that I was missing a receipt that I might need later, so, mumbling under my breath, I retraced my steps to the mall entrance.

As I was searching the wet pavement for the lost receipt, I heard a quiet sobbing. The crying was coming from a poorly dressed boy about 12 years old. He was short and thin, and had no coat. He was just wearing a ragged flannel shirt to protect him from the cold night's chill. Oddly enough, he was holding a hundred dollar bill in his hand. Thinking that he had gotten lost from his parents, I asked him what was wrong.

He told me his sad story. He said that he came from a large family. He had three brothers and two sisters. His father had died when he was nine years old. His mother was poorly educated and worked two full time jobs. She made very little to support her large family. Nevertheless, she had managed to save two hundred dollars to buy her children Christmas presents. The young boy had been dropped off on the way to her second job. He was to use the money to buy presents for all his siblings and save just enough to take the bus home. He had not even entered the mall, when an older boy grabbed one of the hundred dollar bills and disappeared into the night.
""Why didn't you scream for help?"" I asked.

The boy said, ""I did.""

""And nobody came to help you?"" I wondered. The boy stared at the sidewalk and sadly shook his head.

""How loud did you scream?"" I inquired. The soft-spoken boy looked up and meekly whispered, ""Help me!""

I realized that absolutely no one could have heard that poor boy cry for help. So, I grabbed his other hundred and ran to my car.","Late last week, I was rushing around trying to get some last minute shopping done.",14

""Joe, Joe, how are you?"" he greets his old buddy after getting his attention.

""Not so good,"" says Joe.

""Why, what happened?"" Steven queries.

""Well,"" Joe says, ""I just went bankrupt and I've still got to feed my family. I don't know what I'm going to do.""

""Could have been worse,"" Steven replies calmly. ""Could have been worse.""  
 

A month or so later, Steven again encounters Joe, in a restaurant. ""And how are things now?"" he asks.

""Terrible!"" says Joe. ""Our house burned down last night.""

""Could have been worse,"" says Steven, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.

A month later, Steven runs into Joe a third time. ""Well, how goes it?"" he inquires.

""Oh!"" says Joe. ""Things just get worse and worse. It's one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!""

Joe nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: ""Could've been worse.""  
 

This time, Joe grabs Steven by the shoulders. ""Wait a minute!"" he says. ""I'm not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past few months we've run into one another, and every time I've told you the latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: 'Could have been worse.' This time, for God's sake, Steven, I want you to tell me: how in Heaven's name could it have been any worse?""  
 

Steven looks at Joe with the same little wisp of a smile. ""Could have been worse,"" he says. ""Could have happened to me.""",It could have been worse,2

Everything was fine until the couple went down for dinner. The girlfriend had dropped her fork. The waiter immediately saw this and asked them, ""Do you want a f\*ck?""

The couple, although a bit disturbed, told him no. There were no more incidents until the couple went back to their room. There was no sheet on the bed, and the quick-eyed waiter saw this and asked them, ""Do you want a sh\*t?""

By now, the couple was not that welcoming of the waiter, as you would imagine, and hurried outside to enjoy the ocean. However, the waiter finally realized he had made some mistakes, and followed them outside.

On the beach, the couple had already changed into their swimming suits. The guy was sitting under a parasol and the girl  had just came out of the water, and had bits of sand all over her body. The waiter spotted them and quickly ran toward them.

The couple was not pleased to see him, but decided to forgive him after they heard him genuinely apologize for the things he said.

Hoping to start a friendly conversation to strengthen their bonds, the waiter decided to comment about the sand on the beach.",A German friend told me this one. A couple went to an exotic island for a vacation.,5

Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his fla
