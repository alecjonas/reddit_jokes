After much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. 

When he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem.

 Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. 

He could lower the huge throne for use during the day and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. 

This was truly the best of both worlds for the king.

Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him. 

The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones.""","There was once an island kingdom whose people were all fabulously wealthy. Even though they could have afforded to live anywhere they wanted, tradition dictated they stay on their tiny island home.

Somehow I won – I guess I just got lucky, but she turned off the game and started sulking, and didn't speak to me for a while. I didn't want our meetup to end like this, so I tried to motivate her:

He asks his wife what his slogan should be and she says: ""Well you don't beat me, the kids, or your cow, so use that.""

So Juan runs for city council using the slogan: ""I don't beat my wife, I don't beat my kids, I don't beat my cow.""

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. They vote in the election and Juan wins in a landslide. So now Juan is a city council member and he's doing a great job. He fixes potholes and helps local schools. Someone suggests he runs for mayor since he's so well liked. Juan thinks: ""Yeah I'm doing a great job I should run for mayor.""

So Juan runs for mayor. He thinks: ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and he uses his slogan from the last election. ""I don't beat my wife, I don't beat my kids, I don't beat my cow.""

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. They vote in the election and Juan wins in a landslide. So now Juan is the mayor and he's doing a great job. He lowers taxes and fixes traffic lights. Someone suggests he runs for governor since he's so well liked. Juan thinks: ""Yeah I'm doing a great job I should run for governor.""

So Juan runs for governor using the slogan : ""I don't beat my wife, I don't beat my kids, I don't beat my cow.""

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. They vote in the election and Juan wins in a landslide. So now Juan is the governor and he's doing a great job. He brings more tourism to the state and repaves highways. Someone suggests he runs for congress since he's so well liked. Juan thinks: ""Yeah I'm doing a great job I should run for congress.""

So Juan runs for congress using the slogan : ""I don't beat my wife, I don't beat my kids, I don't beat my cow.""

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. They vote in the election and Juan wins in a landslide. So now Juan is in congress and he's doing a great job. He's getting bills passed and reaching across the aisle. Someone suggests he runs for president since he's so well liked. Juan thinks: ""Yeah I'm doing a great job I should run for president.""

So Juan runs for president using the slogan : ""I don't beat my wife, I don't beat my kids, I don't beat my cow.""

And people go nuts for it. They love Juan. So much so, that Juan's opponent in the presidential race tells the public to vote for Juan. Juan wins in a landslide and now he's the president. But this time he's not doing such a good job. He's not making good deals with foreign countries, taxes go up, and there's road closures everywhere. The public turns on Juan and they're looking for anything to use against him.

The pressure gets to Juan.

One day he comes home and his wife hasn't made dinner yet and he gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset... 

That he beats his wife.

And just as he realizes what he's done, his kids come running into the kitchen yelling and screaming and he gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset...

That he beats his kids.

And he realizes what he's done and goes to see his cow to calm down. He starts to milk his cow, remembering simpler days when he was just a farmer in a small town. And just as he's about to finish filling the bucket with milk, the cow kicks it over. He gets so mad, he gets so angry, he gets so upset...

That he beats his cow. 

And he's so disappointed in himself. He's let down his wife, his kids, his cow, and his country.

Well one of the White House staff see this and leaks it to the press. The public is livid. They hate Juan. He lied to them! He does beat his wife! He does beat his kids! He does beat his cow! They cry for impeachment. Juan decides to hold a press conference to address the nation.

Juan gets up on stage to make his speech when someone in the crowd yells ""Down with Juan!"" and shoots him with a golf gun.

Not sure what a golf gun is, but it sure put a hole in Juan.",Farmer Juan wants to run for city council,1

A U.S. Marine General was about to start the morning briefing to his staff. While waiting for the coffee machine to finish brewing, the General decided to pose a question to all assembled.

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep. He posed the question of just how much of sex was “work” and how much of it was “pleasure?”

A Major chimed in with 75%-25% in favor of work.
A Captain said it was 50%-50%.
A Lieutenant responded with 25%-75% in favor of pleasure, depending upon his state of inebriation at the time.

There being no consensus, the General turned to the Private First Class who was in charge of making the coffee and asked for his opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young Private First Class responded, “Sir, it has to be 100% pleasure.”

The General was surprised and as you might guess, asked why?

“Well, sir, if there was any work involved, the officers would have me doing it for them.”

The room fell silent.

God Bless the enlisted man.

The head monk tells him, ""one last thing, you must take a vow of silence, but you may speak to words to me, once every 2 years."" The man agrees again, and begins his journey.  Over the next 2 years, he learns the ways of monkdom, he eats with the other monks, he cleans the monastery, he maintains the gardens, he meditates, and does it all silently.

The head monk pulls him aside one day and says, ""It has been 2 years since you first came to us, what words would you like to say?""

The man thinks, and then replies, ""bed hard"".

The head monk just nods an acknowledgement, and the man goes back to his chores.  He continues this way, cleaning, meditating, eating with the other monks day in day out, and eventually another day came when the head monk again tells him that he may speak two more words.  

The man, without needing much time to think says, ""food bad"".

Again, a patient nod is given by the head monk, and again the man goes back to his quiet simple life at the monastery.

Everything remains the same over the next two years, but when the head monk finds the man for his opportunity to say two words he can clearly see that the man is bothered.  He tells him again that he may speak two words.

The man just says, ""I quit""

The head monk nods, and then replies, ""I'm not surprised. You've done nothing but bitch since you got here.""",A man gets sick of it all and joins a monastery,73

The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

Since he is hungry, he plans to order a sandwich, but he is a man of great courtesy, so he wants to order one with plenty in stock. 

He gazes at the menu and sees a sandwich made of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing on rye. He asks the waiter, “How many sandwiches of this variety do you have?” The waiter responds, “3. The Number of Reuben.” Dumas decides that this is too little and looks from a different sandwich. 

He then finds one with roast pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and yellow mustard. He asks the waiter how much of that sandwich they have and he responds, “1. The Quantity of Cuban.” 

Finally finding a sandwich he hopes that the cafe will have enough, it is ham and cheese between French Toast, he asked the waiter the quantity of the sandwich. The waiter does not know so he goes back into the kitchen to check. Dumas pulls out his notebook and writes. 

While writing a contemporary sits down by Dumas. The waiter returns and says “69.” The contemporary thought the waiter was talking to another table and asks Dumas, “What is this?” The waiter responds, “The Count of Monte Cristo.”",A long literature joke.,2

Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch.

The woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.
The little boy says, ""Dark in here.""

The man says, ""Yes, it is.""

Man - ""That's nice.""
Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$150""
Man - ""Sold.""

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.

Boy - ""Dark in here.""
Man - ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a Wilson infielder's glove.""
The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy,""How much?""
Boy - ""$350""
Man - ""Highway robbery. Sold.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your gloves, let's go outside and have a game of catch.""

The boy says, ""I can't, I sold my ball and my glove.""
The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""
The boy says, ""$500""
The father says, ""That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that... that is way more than those two things cost.
I'm going to take you to church and make you confess your greed.""

He contacts him, and they agree on a price of £1, which is paid up front. The man tells Arthur that his wife shops at Tesco on Saturday mornings. 
That Saturday, Arthur goes to the Tesco, sees his mark, comes up behind her, and in one smooth motion slips a garrote over her neck and kills her. However, a store employee saw this and came running over, bad move, he too ends up garrotted. Arthur realizes he has to move quickly, and heads to the exit. The store manager has seen what happened, and is coming down toward Arthur. He's hoping his few years in the army a decade ago serve him well, but he is no match for Arthur, who as they grapple, manages to get his hands around the managers neck and squeeze the life out of him.
Arthur heads for the exit, but there are 2 security guards. He tries to barrel past, but they are having none of it. They scuffle, Arthur gains the upper hand, and one of the guards is dead, the garrote limp around his neck, but then the second guard manages to smash Arthur's head against the wall, and he goes down, unconscious.
The police are called, and justice begins to run its course.

A girl turned up on a blind date only to find that the guy had no arms or legs. Apparently he was a military vet who lost his limbs in action in some war.

Still not wanting to be rude or seem politically incorrect, she decided that it's just dinner and it couldn't hurt.

Much to her surprise, the guy was a great conversationalist and really interesting and they just clicked.

They got back to her house and things get hot and heavy.

As the clothes start to come off the guy hesitates a bit and asks that the lights to be turned off because he doesn't want to be so vulnerable on a first date.

She understandably agrees and the lights are turned off and she experiences the most intense lovemaking of her life. The orgasms were intense.

In the morning she told him that he was the greatest lover he ever had. He thanked her for a great night and for her kind words. He then confessed, ""I didn't want you to find out right away, but I also lost my penis in the war.""

She was flabbergasted. But how then? He couldn't finger her or use hands, and it was certainly not a tongue she felt last night.

She was stumped.",She was in good hands,12

""Another round,"" the man says, putting a stack of money on the counter. The bartender obliges, and again the two companions down their drinks. This continues several times over, until both man and giraffe look well and truly sloshed. Finally, the man gets up, places a tip on the counter, then stumbles off of his stool towards the exit. The giraffe attempts to follow, but simply collapses unconscious on the floor.

Unfortunately, neither of them has much luck, until all of a sudden, the priest feels a huge tug in his line. With some help from the fisherman, he reels in what must be a thirty pound largemouth bass.

Forgetting himself, the fisherman cries out, ""Woah, look at that big son-of-a-bitch!""

Appalled, the priest responds, ""Excuse me?"" 

The fisherman doesn't want to break ties with the priest, and he sees only one way out. ""Oh, no, Father, you misunderstand. This fish is called the son-of-a-bitch.""

""Oh, of course. I never would have known. Forgive me, my son.""

The fisherman cleans the gargantuan bass. They wrap up their day of fishing and head back to the priest's home, since they've decided to cook up the bass for dinner. The priest walks into the house with his cooler, and presents the fish to his cook.

""Look at this big son-of-a-bitch I caught!"" he says.

""Oh my God! It's the biggest I've ever seen! But are you sure you should be using that language, Father?"" the cook responds.

""Oh, don't worry. This fish's name is 'the son-of-a-bitch.' The fisherman told me so.""

""Oh, I understand. I'll start cooking it right away!""

As it happens, this priest is good personal friends with the Pope. By chance, the Pope happens to be in town, so he stops by to see his old friend. He is invited to stay for dinner.

The fisherman, the cook, the priest, and the Pope all are enjoying their dinner, when the Pope speaks up. 

""Forgive me, friends, for I know that gluttony is a sin, but I simply can't help myself from eating this marvelous fish. I must know who is responsible.""

""Well, I caught the son-of-a-bitch,"" the priest says.

""I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch,"" the fisherman says.

""And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch,"" the cook says.

The Pope looks around the room, astonished. The other three men realize they may have made a great mistake.

After a solid minute of silence, the Pope says, ""You know, you motherfuckers are alright.""","In a small town there's a priest who makes good friends with his congregation. One Sunday, a fisherman invites the priest to go fishing with him.",117

The bear, his throat scratchy and dry, growls back at the barkeep, ""Gimme a beer!""
The bartender continues to work the crossword puzzle he had started earlier, and without even looking up, just shakes his head slowly, takes a drag off his cigarette, and says, ""Sorry, but it's against the law to serve beer to brown bears at bars in Billings.""
The bear just stood there in disbelief, squinting his eyes, trying to get a better look at the bartender to see if he had a smile on his face. The bear stands up and puffs his chest out, looking as intimidating as possible. ""What the fuck do you mean, you don't sell beer to brown bears at bars in Billings?""
The bartender replies matter of factly, ""Just like I said. We don't sell beer to beligerent brown bears at bars in Billings.""
The bear, really thirsty and agitated by this point, threatens the bartender, saying,""Look! If you don't give me a goddamned beer right now, I'm going right down there to the other end of the bar, grab the first person that looks good, and I'm going to eat them right here in front of everyone!""
The bartender fills in another crossword answer, obviously completely unimpressed with the bears bravado. 
""Look, buddy, I already told you, WE DONT SERVE BEER TO BELIGERANT, BULLY BROWN BEARS AT BARS IN BILLINGS! Simple as that.""
The bear is completely enraged, and storms down towards the end of the bar, intent on making good on his promise. He sees a hot young lass, laughing with her friends, completely unaware of the bears dilemma, or his resulting bad mood. The bear slams one big massive paw straight into her face, knocking her out cold, and sending everyone else in the bar scrambling for the exits. The bear began tearing the girl apart, devouring everything, and leaving nothing behind except a huge bloody mess all over the billiards tables. As the bear finished his meal, he noticed the bar was completely empty now, except for himself and the bartender, whom was still leaning against the cooler behind the bar, working on his puzzle. The bear is in complete disbelief at how much difficulty he is having getting this slags attention.
""SOooooo..."", says the bear, ""I think it's about fucking time you get me my goddamned beer! Don't you?""
A smirk starts to form on the bartender's face, once again slowly shaking his head while he talks, and wipes away the ever-present sweat from his brow. ""Nope. I sure don't. This is the last time I am going to say it. We do not serve beer to BELIGERANT BULLY brown bears at bars in Billings... that are on drugs.""

After a couple of bags was transfused, the life of the sheikh was saved. After hearing what the rabbi did, the sheikh sent generous gifts to the rabbi. These included bricks of gold, tons of cash and luxurious cars he didn't even know existed. 

Years passed and the Sheikh needed blood transfusion again, the rabbi was informed and again without hesitation, donated blood. The sheikh's life has been saved once again, and knowing the donor, he never hesitated to send a ""Thank You!"" letter and a bouquet of flowers.

The rabbi, confused, called the sheikh and asked why he only received a letter and a bunch of flowers, to which he answered, ""You see my friend, I now have Jewish blood running through my veins.""",The Rabbi and the Sheikh,18

As they drew closer Peter said “Before I can let you pass into heaven you each need to answer a question.

He turned toward sister Enid and asked have you ever had any experience of the male penis?

Sister Enid blushed and put her head down and told St Peter that when she was younger she accidently caught a glimpse of her brother when he was in the shower.

Don’t worry said Peter Bath your eyes in the font in front of the gates and then pass into heaven.

He turned to sister Steph and asked the same question about her experience with the male penis.

She went bright red and started to mumble away about how before she took holy orders she was a bit wayward and once gave an old boyfriend a hand job.

Don’t worry said St Peter wash your hands in the font in front of the gates and then pass into heaven.

At that moment sister Clarence and sister Mary ran towards the font and started fighting in front of it. St Peter was not amused and shouted at the two women to stop… Once calm had been established he asked sister Clarence what it was all about.

Oh St peter she said I am so sorry but I just wanted to rinse my mouth out at the font before sister Mary washed her arse",4 nuns....,5

The man sees a very nice looking greyhound sitting there.
""Do you really talk?"" he asks the greyhound.
""Yes,"" the greyhound replies.
After recovering from the shock of hearing the greyhound talk, the man asks, ""So, tell me your story.""
The greyhound looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the SAS.
""In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a greyhound would be eavesdropping.
""I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years.
But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Heathrow to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired.""
The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the greyhound.
""Ten quid,"" the owner says.
""£10!!? But this greyhound is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""
""Because he's a lying bastard. He's never been out of the garden!!.",A man sees a sign outside a house - 'Talking greyhound For Sale.',23

The man is confused, but the frog speaks again, “ribbit, 9 iron”

To prove the frog wrong, the man pulls out his 9 iron and swings at the ball. 

Hole in one. 

The man bends down and says “you must be a lucky frog”

The frog replies, “ribbit, lucky frog”

The man takes the frog to the next hole and the frog goes, “ribbit, 3 wood”

The man pulls out a three wood and swings. 

Hole in one.

“Wow you really are a lucky frog, what’s next?” the man asks.

“Ribbit, Vegas.”

So the man takes the frog to the casino and walks up to the roulette table and asks the frog, “what’s the bet?”

“Ribbit, $6000, black, 6.”

“That’s a million-in-one bet,” the man says. He puts down the bet anyways and he hits. 

The man then goes and gets the most expensive penthouse in all of Vegas. 

“How can I ever repay you?” the man asks.

“Ribbit, kiss me”

So he kisses the frog and it turns into a 15 year old girl
