post,d66hf3,2qh72,jokes,false,1568854167,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d66hf3/disgusting/,self.jokes,,"I was walking past a gay bar pumping with music the other day.

It was some Nickelback song. And keep in mind this bar was packed full of guys.

Actually, before I go on…

I just want to acknowledge that this is not going to be a popular joke!!

In fact if you’re offended easily, I’d rather you just stopped reading now.

Because this one will cut deep. But honestly, I was disgusted by this and I need to get it off my chest.

Still with me? Alright

I grew up in a small Aussie town. Out in the bush. Still, I consider myself tolerant of the choices other people make.

So when I was walking past this gay bar last week, music blaring and guys everywhere, I wasn’t going to say anything.

The only people around the door were these two men standing out the front anyway. Big guys too. Obviously spent a lot of time in the gym.

One was in a blue singlet and the other wore a mesh tank top.

They were each drinking a beer and they seemed to be *very* flirty. Either they were dating or they’d just met and hit it off. I don’t know which.

Anyway, as the music kept reverberating out the door, the guy in the blue singlet put his hand on the other man’s arm and I froze in my tracks.

I’ll accept a lot. But something about the whole situation just wasn’t right.

But like I said, I’d been taught to be accepting, so I put my head down and continued on my way.

An hour or so later I was walking back on the same street. And I could hear the music from at least a block away.

Louder. And louder. And **louder**.

By the time I got back to the gay bar the same two men were still out the front.

This time though, the guy in the blue singlet was much drunker. He was swaying and stumbling onto the sidewalk. Almost in time to the music that came from inside the open doors.

So get this, the other guy catches him and their eyes lock. There’s a moment where they just look at each other. And all the while the music is just bursting out onto the street.

At this point the guy in the blue singlet leans forward like he’s about to kiss the other guy and I’ve fucking had enough.

I can handle a lot in my city. But some things just disgust me.

I stormed towards them. My hands shaking and my heart beating out of my chest. No longer able to hide my true thoughts as I said…

&gt;“You were listening to Nickelback when I walked past earlier. And you’re *still* listening to Nickelback now!”

Nickelback disgusts me.

Not in my city.",Disgusting!!,19

The pilot and co-pilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The co-pilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered
 with sunglasses. 

At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway. 

The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying,
 and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical. 

When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne. 

Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to kno when to take off!",[Long] a blind joke.,7

He comes in with a scowl on his face and a furrowed brow, his expression showing a frustrated yet pensieve look about him. He asks for a plain, black coffee.   

The barista compassionately eyed the man for a moment and asked, ""Excuse me, I can't help but notice you seem seem upset, is everything alright?"" The programmer replies, ""Yeah, yeah I'm fine... I just have this project at work where I need to integrate several complicated functions into one software application, but they're all written in different languages and nothing I do seems to work!"" The barista understandingly smiles, and suggests he go walk his dog and mull things over. He thanks her, and decides it would be a good idea to get some fresh air and get some circulation going after sitting for so long in front of his computer at work, so he sets out on a short trek down the nearby street.   

Incidentally, he walks past a pet shop, and upon seeing the animals in the window, his dog, stops, turns to his owner and begins to bark excitedly. ""You want to go in boy?"" he asks. ""Come on, let's go check it out.""    

The dog immediately makes for the window section of the shop he had seen from outside, which contained a large, dull brown colored constrictor snake. The top of the enclosure was open, and not very high off the ground, which the programmer's dog took full advantage off, sprinting headfirst to get to the snake. The programmer, surprised by the sudden explosive movement, spills the rest of his coffee, getting it everywhere - all over his shirt, the floor, and even both of   animals got  in front of him got splashed with the  now-lukewarm brew.    

Immediately, the dog whimpered and retreated from the  mess as far as the leash would allow him, and the snake recoiled and likewise put as much distance between him as he could to the puddle of coffee that had formed in the enclosure. The pet shop owner jogged over to clean it up, and, amid profuse apologies, waved down the programmer's offer to help  and said it was all okay, no real harm was done. As soon as the coffee had been mopped up, though, the dog went back to trying to get at the snake, but now the man was ready and held the leash back a safe distance.

""Oh, I gotta smoke up this here weed. You should come up and help me."" replied the         monkey.

   So the monkey and the lizard are smoking up the weed, getting pretty fucked up and   philosophizing about how harsh the jungle can be. After  awhile, the lizard starts to get thirsty. 

""Ill be right back. Gonna get a drink from the river."" 

The lizard heads to the river for a drink, but is so high that he falls in the river, and starts to drown. An alligator sees him drowning and feels bad for him. If the alligator had a son, he would look a lot like that lizard; he'd be damned if he let that little lizard drown. Carrying the lizard safely to the shore, the alligator asks,

""What happened lizard? How could you be so careless man?

""I'm fucked up. Gator, I'm really fucking high. This monkey in a tree has got sack of budah he needs to-

""A monkey-

""Yeah, in a tree-

""A monkey in a tree got you so high you nearly drown? I gotta meet this monkey.""

So the alligator heads into the woods in search of the monkey. There, plain as day, is the monkey with huge blunt smoking away.

""Hey monkey!"" shouted the alligator.

The monkey took a long confused look at the alligator and said,

""Holy shit man, how much water did you drink?""",A lizard is walking through the jungle ...,62

Finally,  the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took  the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another.  They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few  minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man,  wiping the sweat from his brow. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks'  he said. 'I had to strangle that bitch to death'.",The FBI had an open position for an assassin,381

This once again gets the woman pissed-off and she decides that instead of 3 minutes in the freezer, she is going to keep the parrot in for 5 minutes.

Well the parrot has had *lots* of time to think this time, and remorse gives way to desperation, and finally to anger so that the adrenaline will allow him to continue to live.

FINALLY the woman opens the freezer door, takes out the near frozen parrot and asks... ""Well, have you learned your lesson?""

Against her parents' wishes, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.

Noe Schitt later married Mr. Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock. Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.

Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout their childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. Thewedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg,Byrd, and Horse.

Trump frowns. ""I already have the smartest people. Just the best, everyone knows it. I'm the best at picking people. What makes... How do you think you have the best people?""

The Queen takes a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy. You just ask them to answer an intelligence riddle.""

The Queen pushes a button on her intercom. ""Please send Theresa Ma- wait, no, I forgot... send *Boris Johnson* in here, would you?""

Boris Johnson walks into the room. ""You what, maam?""

The Queen smiles. ""Answer me this, please, Boris. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""

Boris thinks for a minute, counts on his fingers for a bit before sheepishly replying ""...me?""

""Yes! Very good,"" says the Queen, tossing Boris a biscuit.

Back at the White House, Trump asks to speak with Vice President Mike Pence.

""Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and father have a child, okay? That kid- it's not your brother and it's not your sister. So it's someone else, and you've got to tell me who that kid is. Who is it?""

""I'm not sure,"" says the Vice President. ""Let me get back to you on that one.""

Mike Pence goes to his advisers and asks every one, but none can give him an answer. He even tries praying, but God doesn't give him an answer. Even Mother couldn't help him. Finally, he gets to the end of his secret contact list and sends Vladimir Putin a call.

Mike shouts, ""Hello, your Excellency. Can you answer this for me? Your mother and your father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?

Putin responds back, ""It's me.""

Mike Pence smiles. ""Thank you very much, boss!"" and goes back to the Oval Office to speak with Trump.

""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's Vladimir Putin.""

Trump gets up, thinks it over, and responds, ""What riddle? I have no idea what you're talking about.""

So he went to her for advice about how to fix this issue.

She came up with a solution and told the jailer to call every inmate to the common area except an inmate named Ria. She told all of them that over the course of the next one week they all must convince Ria that she had to cut off Joanna's right toe when in fact Joanna had lost the same in an accident the previous year.

A week later, when Joanna was sleeping Ria entered her cell only to realise that Joanna didn't have a right toe.
Suddenly the entire prison got back it's electric supply.

All of them were shocked and went to Joanna for an answer.
She replied saying ""My toe conned Ria and hence we got power to the cell.""",An entire prison was facing electricity outage for a year.,17

“Alright bud, you’re only getting in today if you can make me laugh, so why don’t you tell me about how you died.”

The man looked at Saint Peter and said, “Oh man, it was awful! I was absolutely sure my wife was having an affair, so I left work early to come home and try to catch her in the act. When I got home, sure as shit there she was, naked on the bed! I looked all over the apartment, but I couldn’t find the guy anywhere. So I went outside on our 25th story balcony, and there he was!! Hanging over the edge by his fingertips! So I ran inside, and grabbed my hammer and ran back outside and started smashing his hands and fingers with it! He finally let go, and he fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so I ran inside and using all of my might, I grabbed my refrigerator, picked it up, and threw it over the rail and on top of the guy, crushing and killing him!! But all of the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and I died.”

Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let the poor soul in. 

Another man came walking up to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter told this man the same thing—that in order to get in, he was going to have to make Saint Peter laugh. So the second started to tell Saint Peter how he died. 

“Oh man, it was awful! I was doing aerobics out on my 26th story balcony of my apartment, when all of a sudden a flock of birds came out of nowhere and started attacking me! I was trying to get away, but I fell over the edge of my railing! However, on my way down I managed to grab the railing of the apartment below mine...but then this maniac suddenly showed up and started smashing my hands and fingers with a hammer until I let go! Fortunately for me, I landed in some bushes, but then some guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!

Saint Peter chuckled again, let the second guy into heaven, and was realizing he has found a way he could really start enjoying his job! About that time, a 3rd man comes walking up to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter gave him the speech about needing to make him laugh, and asks him how he died.

“Oh man, you’re never going to believe this shit! Alright, so picture this—I’m butt naked and hiding in a refrigerator...”","It’s getting crowded in heaven, so one day Saint Peter decides to only accept people who make him laugh.",2706

The bartender says back ""oh no that's our challenge jar, put $20 bucks in it and you can take a swing!""

The man thought well shit that's alot of money, I'll take a swing, and dropped a twenty dollar bill in the jar. ""Alright I'll take a shot what do I gotta do?""

The bartender reached under the bar,  pulled out a bottle of Jim beam, and sat it on the counter in front of the traveller. ""First things first you gotta drink that whole bottle of whiskey that we've been tryna get rid of for a while now. Drink it quick too don't babysit it. After that we got a mean ass rotwiller in the back with a rotten tooth. Tried to pull it, but the damn dog won't let anybody in there. After that tooth is pulled, go on upstairs. There's an old whore up there that's been retired for years now and just can't find a man that'll show her a good time. Go on up there and brighten her day for us. Once you're done with all that then that jar is all yours!""


The traveller thought man thisll be a piece of cake. So he picked up the whiskey and drank it down real quick. He stood up and stumbled a bit but made it out the backdoor of the saloon to go handle the dog. There was a lot of squealing and whining for a minute, and then it got quite. The traveller kicked open the backdoor, covered in blood and cut up from the dog fighting him.

Once he got inside he looked at the bartender and slurred,

The redhead is mortified. ""Oh my, I am so sorry,"" she says as she pops her eye back into place. ""Let me buy your dinner to make it up to you.""

So he joins her table and they enjoy a wonderful meal together. Afterwards they go to the theatre followed by drinks at a bar. They talk, they laugh, she shares her deepest dreams and he shares his. She listens.

After paying for everything, she asks him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap. He says yes and they return to her place.

He ends up staying the night. The next morning, she cooks a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy is amazed at how everything has been so perfect and how incredible this woman is. He can't believe his luck. ""You know,"" he said, ""you are the perfect woman, are you this nice to every guy you meet?""

Through their hard work, they became well known in the DC area and bumped elbows with politicians. 

One summer, they decided to hold a fourth of july party and invite all the members of congress. However, they disagreed on one thing. Lucy liked big parties with lots of guests, while cindy liked more intimate gathering with fewer guests. So they compromised: cindy would throw a party for only senators, and lucy would throw one for the members of the house of representatives.

The parties were a hit! And every year after that, they threw excellent parties with the same arrangement. Senators would gush over cindy's private affair, while lucy threw ragers for the house. 

In their old age, as luck would have it, they were both on their deathbed at the same time. Lucy asked Cindy if she believed in reincarnation. ""Yes, I do in fact"" Cindy responded. Lucy proposed that on July 4th, fifteen years from then, they should meet on the capitol steps and reminisce about old time. 

Lucy was re-born to a wealthy family, and lived a privileged life. On July 4th of her fifteenth year, she walked up the capitol steps, where she accidentally stepped on an ant. She waited for hours for cindy, when she realized in horror that cindy must have been the ant! Lucy felt confused and horrible.

Distraught, she went to the nearest buddhist temple and told the monk their about their similar lives and their careers. When she started explaining how she would throw parties for house members, and cindy for senators, the monk stopped her. 

""You said she just threw parties for senators--no house members allowed?"" the monk asked.

""Yes, that is correct. Why does that explain why I was reincarnated in such a good life while cindy became a lowly bug?""

This time, he rushes out of the stadium to get to the Torero and he asks the cashier, again, for the giant meatballs. “Sorry, last order just got served,” the cashier says, “but if you get here early tomorrow i’ll save it for you.” 
At this point, the man is determined to try this dish. Having seen 2 bullfights already, he decides to skip them and go straight to the Torero the next day. He waits forever after ordering, and finally, his food comes out. His plate has two tiny meatballs on it. “Hey, I ordered the giant meatballs.” complains the man.

 The cashier looks at him and says, “Well you see, the bull doesn’t always lose.”",A man goes to Spain,18

More guests began arrive, all with similar explanations of what mood they were supposed to be dressed as. Pretty soon a couple of Indian men showed up at the door, fully naked. One of them had hollowed out a pear and jammed it on the end of his dick, and the other had his dick in a carton of custard.

The man was pretty dumbstruck. He had no idea who they were, why they were here or why on earth they were  naked. Lost for words, he said ""hiya fellas, what are you dressed as?""

Her son had taken an extreme interest in First Nations culture in the past years going as far as packing his room with First Nations ornaments and trinkets and even changing his name to Spirit Eagle. However, the interesting state of his room was over shadowed by the fact that Spirit Eagle was standing, fully nude, in the centre with his arms outstretched and hands together above his head. Apparently, Spirit Eagle had been like this all day and was refusing to eat, drink or move. The psychiatrist approached Spirit Eagle and asked what he was doing to which Spirit Eagle responded “I am teepee”. Confused the psychiatrist asked if Spirit Eagle would at least drink some water but only got the same “I am teepee” response. Concerned but lost on what to do the psychiatrist informed the mother he’d be back the next day and that she should let him know if anything changes that night. Around 1 am the psychiatrist is woken by a frantic call from the mother saying Spirit Eagle had moved. Racing to the house the psychiatrist entered Spirit Eagle’s room to find he was now standing in the exact same spot only he had lowered he’s arms to shoulder height and bent them to form an arch of sorts. Intrigued the psychiatrist then asked Spirit Eagle what he was doing to which Spirit Eagle responded “I am wigwam”. Once again confused and concerned the psychiatrist promises Spirit Eagle’s mother that he will figure out what’s wrong and cure Spirit Eagle. As such over the span of a month the doctor begins investigating First Nation’s culture through books and living with tribes. He spends hours combing through records of similar cases trying to find an answer. All the while Spirit Eagle is switching between his two poses every day. After a month of almost constant research the psychiatrist returns to the home. He locks himself in Spirit Eagle’s room and after hours of work opens the door to reveal Spirit Eagle dressed and sleeping in a normal position in bed. The mother thanks the psychiatrist endlessly for many minutes while the psychiatrist being the humble man he is deflects the thanks only wishing he had figured out the cause of Spirit Eagle’s condition much sooner. The mother then asks what the problem with her son was to which the psychiatrist responds “Well I’m not sure exactly why, but it seems that your son was just two tents”

""Sure,"" said the president, ""I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!"" The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 am as a witness?'' ""Sure!' replied the confident president.

That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.

The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!""

The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.

""Well, okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure."" Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

She replied, ""Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 am today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.""",The bank president's balls.,41

BJ: Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they will tell you. Everybody knows who I am.

Cashier: I am sorry, Mr Johnson, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them.

BJ: Come on please, I am urging you, please cash this cheque.

Cashier: Alright sir, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without an ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the Thames into a cup of tea held by the bank's chairman without spilling a drop. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

Another time, Gordon Ramsay came in without an ID. To prove who he was, he made delicious chicken parm right here on my table, called the branch manager a fucking donkey, and fired everyone at the fish and chips joint next door. With that we knew who he was and cashed his cheque. So sir, what can you do to prove that it is you and only you?

Johnson stands there thinking and thinking and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank. There is nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. I have absolutely no idea what to do.""

The other guys laugh, assuming that he’s joking, and Larry says “Shit, my buddy Artie just got out of prison and he’s the meanest son of a bitch you’ve ever met. I bet he would do it for a buck.  He’s crazy.”  

Bill gets Artie’s number and meets up with him the following Tuesday . Artie agrees to kill Bill’s wife for just one dollar but only if Billy agrees to let him do it his own way. “The fun part is learning the routine, and even making yourself seen every now and then before finally killing them. Give me a few weeks, but I’ll get it done” Bill and Artie shake hands and Artie begins the process .

He sits outside Bill’s house and follows his wife each day. He figures out that every Tuesday, Bill’s wife goes grocery shopping at Food City. So on the fourth Tuesday, Artie follows her into the grocery store .

As he’s following her in aisle 4, Bill’s wife turns and confronts him... loudly.

“Why are you following me ?! Leave me alone!”

The woman’s confrontation surprises Artie, and he reacts by grabbing her by the throat and choking her to death. Although it wasn’t quite according to his plan, he figures he got the job done and turns around to retreat to his car only to find two older women standing there, mouths agape.

Artie, knowing he’s been caught and that these witnesses have the potential to put him back o prison, immediately springs into action and kills both women, leaving all three dead in aisle 4. 

Unfortunately for Artie, the commotion had caught the attention of many other shoppers, and he was arrested before he could reach his car. Upon his arrest, he spills everything about how Bill had hired him and paid him only a dollar to kill his wife and that the other two women were just collateral damage.  

The next day, the headline of the local paper read:

“ARTIE CHOKES, 3 for $1 AT FOOD CITY”

As the tribe's land was near several rich gold mines, the king and his people were extremely wealthy. 

During the woman's time with him, the king fell hopelessly in love with her, as she was very beautiful. When it came time for her to leave to return to the United States, the king called her into his palace and spoke passionately to her via the interpreter. 

""King Paolo begs you to remain here and be his wife. He will grant you any three requests within his power; whatever you ask will be yours."" 

Flattered but not desiring to remain in the Amazon forever, the woman decided to ask for impossible favors to avoid having to turn the king down and hurt his feelings. ""Tell the king that I accept, but if he cannot fulfill my three requests, I must leave immediately. My first wish is for a 50-carat diamond engagement ring and 25-carat bracelets and necklaces to match.""

When the request was relayed to him, the king nodded without hesitation and responded in primitive English: ""Okay, okay! I buy, I buy!""

The woman frowned, not expecting the king to be able to fulfill the ask. She decided to make the next request truly impossible: ""My second wish is to live in a home exactly like this one."" She pulled up her phone and displayed a picture of a nine-figure Beverly Hills mansion with three pools, gatehouses, acres of perfectly landscaped property, indoor basketball courts and theatre rooms, the whole nine yards.

When the interpreter explained the request to the king, he waved his hand and nodded eagerly. ""Okay, okay, I build! I build!"" 

He motioned to his nearby advisors, who immediately contacted the finest architects in Brazil to consult on the project. In exchange for several tons of gold, the architects designed an identical residence and brought in several construction companies to begin work immediately. They brought in solar panels and hydroelectric units to power the buildings. Paying triple the usual rate, the king had land cleared and construction completed within days. It was some real Extreme Makeover: Home Edition shit. 

Dumbfounded and a bit concerned, as she still had no desire to remain in the rainforest for the rest of her life, the woman went before the king with her final request, determined to come up with something that no amount of money could provide. ""Tell the king that the man I marry must have a penis that's 12 inches long.""

Looking horrified, King Paolo arose from his throne and strode around the room muttering to himself, first angrily and then sadly. He seemed to be thinking desperately, searching for options. But finally, he shook his head sadly, and spoke in a tone of resignation: ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.""",A woman visited an Amazonian tribe on a research trip...,1580

A man was dining alone in a fancy restaurant and there was a Gorgeous redhead sitting at the next table. He had been checking her out since he sat down, but lacked the nerve to talk with her.

Suddenly she sneezed, and her glass eye came flying out of its socket towards the man. He reflexively reached out, grabbed it out of the air, and handed it back.

'Oh my, I am so sorry,' the woman said, as she popped her eye back in place. 'Let me buy your dinner to make it up to you.'

They enjoyed a wonderful dinner together, and afterwards they went to the theater followed by drinks. They talked, they laughed, she shared her deepest dreams and he shared his. She listened to him with interest.

After paying for everything, she asked him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap and stay for breakfast. They had a wonderful, wonderful time.

The next morning, she cooked a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy was amazed. Everything had been so incredible!

'You know,' he said, 'you are the perfect woman. Are you this nice to every guy you meet?'

'No,' she replies.

I was cleaning out my wife's grandpa's cellar and found 12 bottles of his home-bottled grape wine under the steps. My wife told me to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or else. I agreed to do the unpleasant task.

I withdrew the cork form the first bottle and poured the contents down the sink, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I extracted the cork from the second bottle, did likewise, and drank one glass, just to check the taste to see if the old fellow knew his wine making. He did. 

I then opened the third bottle, and poured it, too, down the sink, but not until drinking one full glass to check the purity. It was very good. I did this, also with the fourth bottle. One glass for myself, and the rest down the sink. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next, and drank one sink out of it and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork from the bottle, then corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour. 

When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the bottles, corks, glasses and sinks with the other, which were 29, and as the house came by I counted them again, and finally had all the houses in one bottle, which I drank. I felt so foolish that I couldn't go upstairs and congratulate my wife to tell her what a great winemaker her grandpa was.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,71

""They suck your dick while they whistle? That's impossible!"" 

Then he passed another sign: ""Whistle Blowjobs - 5 miles"" 

And another: ""Whistle Blowjobs - 1 mile"" 

At this time he was so curious about it that he started to consider the idea.

""Whistle Blowjobs - turn right"" The last sign said

Then he turned right, and saw a small wood cabin on the woods, with a beautiful blonde woman on the front. 

""Hey!"" he said

""Hey there honey!"" She replied

""You do the Whistle Blowjobs yourself? What it is all about?"" He asked

""Yes honey, I do! And I'll suck your dick while whistling the tune of really famous pop songs"" She said

The man was astonished"" How could it be possible? Imagine the control you would need to have to perform such an act. Imagine the skill that woman must have on her mouh and tongue!"" 

He got so curious that he tried: ""Oh lady, I want one!"" 

""100 dollars"" She said

""100 dollars? well that's expensive.."" 

""Not expensive for my whistle blowjob honey!"" said the woman.

So he accepted and walked inside the cabin. Then the woman said:

""To perform the act I need all lights out, so you don't see exactly what I'm doing and the magic ain't ruined"" 

""Ok!"" He replied, already laying down and taking down his pants. 

Then the woman started sucking his dick, every movement perfectly executed, then she started to whistle the tune of the song Californication, from Red Hot. 

The man was really fucking surprised, how could that be possible? 

When she finished, he asked for another round, for another 100 bucks

""Ma'am, could you do it while I'm standing?"" 

""Yeah sure"" She replied, and started blowing him while he was standing

But this time the man was in arm's reach from the light switch, willing to discovery how such incredible blowjob was done.

Soon she was going to start, he flicked the light switch, iluminating the room, just to see her glass eye sitting on the table next to him.","A man was driving on the freeway when he saw a sign that said ""Whistle Blowjobs - 10 miles""",123
