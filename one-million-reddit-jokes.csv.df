Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,23

One day she tells me ""My husband's going out of town on business this Sunday. Why don't you come over? I'll be alone in the house :-)""

""What if he comes back while I'm there?"" I ask.

""Oh he won't, don't worry.""

""Yeah, but what if he does?"" (I'm not the one to take any stupid chances at my age.)

""I'm sure he won't, but if he does, you just start cleaning the windows. I'll tell him you're from the cleaning company. Anyways he keeps complaining about how his mom keeps their house cleaner than I ever could. I'll just tell him it was meant to be a surprise for him. He won't suspect a thing.""

It sounds like a brilliant plan! I tell myself ""Man! She's not only smoking hot, she's also smart!... and she wants ME!""

So, I show up next Sunday and just my luck, the dude comes back within minutes, saying his client cancelled on him. I silently thank her for suggesting an easy way out in advance and immediately get to cleaning the windows. Seeing him giving inquisitive glances towards me, Joyce comes to my rescue. Explains how she wanted to surprise him with a sparkling house. 

He starts complaining (like she had told me already) how she's useless and now she's wasting money hiring a cleaning company. She says there was a promotion going on and she apparently got a great deal. Man! The woman can think on her feet!

He finally calmed down, and gets on my case. Micromanaging every bit of the cleaning. Gets me to clean their windows, do the dishes, clean the kitchen, garage, attic… makes me mop, vacuum, do the laundry. I didn't complain once. In fact to make it look more convincing I put in some extra effort. A lot of extra effort.

Finally after six hours of back-breaking work, (the house was filthy by the way) it seems there's nothing left to clean. He calls out to Joyce and asks how much he needs to pay me. She says she's already paid in advance to my office. So the husband tips me a twenty. I thank him and leave. Quietly thanking my luck.. Man what a close save!

Joyce has blocked me on Facebook since the incident. I think it's a smart move, why take another risk?",I'm a middle aged man. I have many friends on Facebook. Some of them are women. I spend quite a bit of time chatting with them. Life is good!,11

Buy him a drink and he’ll tell you.”

The man, lets call him Harry, walks up to the man with the big orange head and says “Hey, do you want me to buy you a drink” and big orange head man replies with “You wanna hear the story don’t you?” Harry said “Sure, if that’s okay.” So the big orange man said the following:

“So I was strolling down the beach, right? As I was walking along I stubbed my toe. I looked down to see what it was and it was a really old kettle looking thing. I picked it up and as I was dusting sand off of it there was a flash of blinding white light and out popped... a genie! I was in shock! Anyway, he said in an incredibly loud voice “YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM A 10,000 YEAR IMPRISONMENT! YOU HAVE 3 WISHES!”
So I said “yeah sure. My first wish is to be stupidly rich.” And all of a sudden there were grills on my teeth, rings on my fingers and I had AirPods in my ears! It was fabulous! So I said “Wow! My second wish is to be married to the most beautiful and lovely woman in the world!” And suddenly I got a tap on the shoulder. I turned around to see who it was, and it was the most beautiful, kind looking woman looking at me lovingly. It was great! And so, and you might agree that this is where I went wrong... my third wish was “I want a big orange head.”

Harry then left the bar, wondering why this had happened to him.",A man walks into a bar and sees a man with a big orange head...,2

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No, this is no good; I've got his problem with my shoulder.
I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.


Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

When he went to the post office to send the letter, he met the mail deliverer Joe. Joe said he would deliver the letter.

The man waited a few days and went back to the post office since he didn't receive a letter back. He saw Joe and asked him if he delivered the letter. Joe said he left the letter in the mailbox, but no one took the letter, so he brought it back the next day.

The man was upset that his daughter ignored him. He left a copy of the same letter every single day at the post office, in the hopes that she would answer one of them someday.

Joe noticed the man sending letter after letter, day by day, for months. His curiosity got the better of him after some time, and he decided to read one of the letters before delivering it. He was astounded at how useful the man's advice was and decided this was worth sharing with everyone, so he called up a local newspaper company.

The newspaper company sent a reporter to come speak with Joe, who told them, ""A man sent the same letter every day for months to his daughter, who never answered the letters. Read the letter! It has some very good information that could help the whole world out.""

The reporter, instead of being interested in what the letter said, was interested in the man's dedication of sending the same letter every day to someone who never responded. The reporter wrote an article and sent it to Joe to look at before publishing.

When Joe looked at it, he said, ""It's outrageous! The reposting gets more attention than the original content!""","A man had an adult daughter who he loved dearly but rarely met. He decided to send her a letter, and in it was hundreds of pieces of advice to help her succeed in life.",6

""Oh, geez, yeah hey Cindy!"" I awkwardly spat out as I sort-of remembered that night, weeks ago. ""You know, this is my work phone, I'm not supposed to take personal calls. I mean, how'd you even get this num-""

""Well I'm calling to explain,"" she interrupted. ""I'm pregnant! And it's definitely yours, and if you don't marry me,"" she sobbed, ""I'm going to take my own life and the child's!""

They talk. They connect. They end up leaving together.

They   get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment she   notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with   soft,sweet, cuddly teddy bears. There are three shelves in the bedroom,   with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed   in rows, covering the entire wall! It was obvious that he had taken   quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched   by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.

There   were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears   covering the length of the middle shelf,and huge, enormous bears running   all the way along the top shelf. She found it strange for an obviously   masculine guy to have such a large collection of Teddy Bears, She is   quite impressed by his sensitive side but doesn’t mention this to him.

They   share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she   finds herself thinking, ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!   Maybe he could be the future father of my children?’

She  turns to  him and kisses him lightly on the lips He responds warmly.  They  continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts  her in  his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off  each  other’s clothes and make hot, steamy love.

She  is so overwhelmed  that she responds with more passion, more  creativity, more heat than she  has ever known. After an intense,  explosive night of raw passion with  this sensitive guy, they are lying  there together in the afterglow. The  woman rolls over, gently strokes  his chest and asks coyly,

""Well,how was it?’

The guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says...

The door opens to a rather withered old Monk, who greets the man. “I am the Head Monk of this monastery. Can I help you?” The man asks for refuge overnight and is taken up into the guest bedroom for the night. 

During the night, the man decides to take a walk around the monastery to pass the time. He comes across a old, degraded wooden door, surrounded by golden material on the hinges. He attempts to open the door but, unfortunately he fails. He goes back to sleep and in the morning, asks the head monk what was in the door. The head monk states: 

“Sorry, only monks are allowed to know what is within that door. I apologise.”

The man replies with “Alright, how do I become a monk then?” To which the Head Monk replies with 

“You must count every grain of sand on the mainland of Albion, aswell as every pebble. Then you must come back to me.” 

The young trainee monk heads out on his quest to be a monk, spending over 20 years counting every grain of sand he comes across and then every pebble in a painstaking journey which nearly costs him his sanity. Throughout his entire journey, the image of that door rests solely on his mind, until he returns to the Monastery and tells the Head Monk his findings. 

“Very good, disciple. You are now a monk. Here is the key to the door.”

The man is handed a wooden key, which remarkably fits into the door and it opens, revealing...

A silver door. He returns to the Head Monk, who then gives him a silver key. Upon unlocking the silver door, he is greeted by...

A golden door. He groans and returns to the head monk, who gives him the golden key. He returns and opens the golden door, only to find...

A ruby door. He goes to the monk, and screams “How many doors are left! I’m sick of this!” 

“It’s ok, this is the last one I promise.” He hands him a ruby encrusted key, one of the finest vintage. The newly made monk returns to the ruby door and opens the hallowed door. He gazes in absolute awe at the sight he came across. It was a sight of which nobody would’ve ever imagined they’d see in their life. You know what it was?

He saw all sorts of things. Ate the greatest food, drank the sweetest wines, sipped the smokiest whiskeys. He climbed mountains, swam in rivers, cycled through valleys and sailed the seas.

Finally, he ended up his trip in The Netherlands. It just so happened that when he was arriving, there was a special festival happening there called De Hoofddorpenpol. Once a year the people of The Netherlands gather together dressed in traditional Dutch footwear and fire bows and arrows into the night sky to celebrate the ancient Dutch Gods.

Upon coming across the wild ritual, it turns out my father promptly had a heart attack in fear of his life and dropped dead.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the priest spoke no Yiddish, they agreed that it would be a “silent” debate.

On the chosen day the priest and rabbi sat opposite each other. The priest raised his hand and showed three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the priest waved his finger around his head. The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The priest brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the priest stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. The Jews had won.

Later the cardinals met with the priest and asked him what had happened. The priest said, “First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. The rabbi responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins, and the rabbi pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue.”

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he’d won. “I haven’t a clue,” said the rabbi. “First, he told me that he was going to beat me in three rounds, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that I was beating around the bush and I told him to get straight to the point.”

The third son grabs his duck. The rest of the family try not to laugh, as they know the least successful son will have no luck.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

 The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. 

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

 The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

 ""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.","A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. She spends $15,000 and looks sensational.",3

A farmer got pulled over by a state trooper for speeding, and the trooper started to lecture the farmer about his speed, and in general began to throw his weight around to try to make the farmer uncomfortable.
Finally, the trooper got around to writing out the ticket, and as he was doing that he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around his head.

The farmer said, ""Having some problems with circle flies there, are ya?""

The trooper stopped writing the ticket and said -- ""Well yeah, if that's what they are -- I never heard of circle flies"".

So the farmer says -- ""Well, circle flies are common on farms. See, they're called circle flies because they're almost always found circling around the back end of a horse.""

The trooper says, ""Oh,"" and goes back to writing the ticket. Then after a minute he stops and says, ""Hey... wait a minute, are you trying to call me a horses back end?""

The farmer says, ""Oh no, officer. I have too much respect for law enforcement and police officers to even think about calling you a horses back end.""

The trooper says, ""Well, that's a good thing,"" and goes back to writing the ticket.

'Can I have a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie?'

The barman is amazed, but gives the rabbit a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie.

The rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie. He then leaves.

The following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie.

The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the Toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed.

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The next night there is standing room only in the pub.

Coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending.

The barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The barman says, 'I'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker, but we are right out of them Ham and Cheese Toasties.'

The rabbit looks aghast.

The crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says,
'We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.

The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will like it.'

The crowd's bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.

The barman, with a roguish smile says, 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends. I know you'll love it.'

'Ok,' says the rabbit, 'I'll have a pint of beer and a Cheese and Onion Toastie.'

The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie.

He then waves to the crowd and leaves....

NEVER TO RETURN!!!!!!

One year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time.

When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

The barman says, 'Who are you?

To which he is answered,
'I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.'

The barman says, 'I remember you. You made me famous.

You would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. Masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

The rabbit says, 'Yes I know.'

The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't have any Ham and Cheese Toasties. You had a Cheese and Onion one instead.'

The rabbit said, 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it.'

The barman said, 'You never came back, what happened?'

'I DIED', said the rabbit.

'NO!' said the barman. 'What from?'

After a short pause, the rabbit said ...

The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench.  


Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment.  


He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . ""In fact"", he pointed out, ""some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society"".  


After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, ""Would you like to know what the painting is really about?""  


""Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery"", asked the couple?  


""Because I am the artist, who painted the picture"", he replied, ""In fact, there are no African Americans depicted at all.

Once they are brought to the guillotine, the doctor is asked whether he wants to lie on his back, and see the blade coming down, or lie on his front, and die a much more sudden death. 

To this he replies: “I do not fear death, let me see the blade come down!” So they lay him on his back and tie him up. 

The blade comes down, but miraculously gets stuck half way. “It is the will of Allah for you to live, you can leave.”

The teacher is next, he is asked the same question, to which he also replies: “I am not afraid of death, let me see blade come down!” So they lay him on his back and tie him up.

The blade is released, but is once again caught half way down the guillotine. “It is the will of Allah for you to live, you can leave.”

The engineer is last, and they ask him the very same question, to which is answers the same: “I am not afraid of death, let me see the blade come down!” So they lay him on his back and tie him up.

The engineer looks up at the guillotine, and his eyes light up.

So the brunette goes online and finds a bull for sale in the city stockyards, about three hours away. The price of the bull is listed as $5,000.

Sadly, their inheritance wasn't much beyond the ranch, and the sisters only have $4,000 in the bank. The truck used for hauling animals is old, and gets terrible gas millage, so the brunette doesn't want to drive the truck to the city unless she knows for sure that they are going to buy.

Explaining this to the blonde, the brunette tells her sister, ""When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll let you know that you need to come."" The blonde replies, ""Great, I'll be here waiting.""

The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he wasn't going to drop his price, of $5,000 but since she is in desperate times, he will go down to $3,999, no less. The brunette reluctantly hands over her $4,000 in cash, and the seller gives her $1 in return. 

After paying, the brunette walks down the street to a telegram office. She walks in and says, ""I need to send a telegram to my sister letting her know that I've bought a bull for our ranch. She needs to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.""

The telegraph operator says that he'll be glad to help her, and adds, ""It's just 99 cents a word."" With just a dollar in her pocket, she realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.

She thinks for awhile, then asks, ""Can you send the word, 'comfortable?'""

The telegraph operator shakes his head. ""How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'""

The brunette explains, 'My sister's blonde. The word's big. She'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull.'

And the brunette waits.

And waits.

And waits.

Hours go by, and the blonde sister never arrives. 

Angrily, the brunette gets back in her car and drives back to the ranch. She bursts in the door of the farmhouse. Upon walking in, the brunette is shocked to see her sister sitting at the table, pants off, masturbating, and watching a video of a rodeo.

“Sister, what are you doing?!?!” she yells.
