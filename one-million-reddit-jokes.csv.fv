When he gets there, the devil comes over to welcome him. The devil then says, “Sometimes it gets pretty uncomfortable down here.”

The man says, “No problem. I’m from Tampa.”

So the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 100, and the humidity up to 80. He then goes back to the Tampa man to see how he’s doing. To the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.

“No problem…just like Tampa in June,” the man says.

So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Tampa man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.

“No problem. Just like Tampa in July,” the man says.

So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.

He says, “No problem. Just like Tampa in August.”

Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.

When he goes back now to see how the Tampa man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Tampa man replies…..

Here are the scorecards from the event:
__________________________________________________

CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint
from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's
the worst one. These Texans are crazy.
__________________________________________________

CHILI # 2 - ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I am
supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to
give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw
the look on my face. __________________________________________________

CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have
been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer
before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the
front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.
__________________________________________________

CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other
mild foods, not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste
it. Is it possible to burnout taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing
behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT
just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?
__________________________________________________

CHILI # 5 - LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
considerable kick. Very Impressive!

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the
cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no
longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics.
The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me
brain damage; Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly
on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses
me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those
rednecks! __________________________________________________

CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and
peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
Superb!

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric
flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through
the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. She
must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe
my ass with a snow cone! __________________________________________________

CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili
peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge
Number 3, He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing
uncontrollably.

FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't
feel a damn thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it
is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid
unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my
damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've
decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any
oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole
in my stomach. __________________________________________________

CHILI # 8 - Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not
too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot.
Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell
over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going
to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?

FRANK: (Not available for comment.)",Texas Chili Cookoff,14

As he hopped out of his truck this rather elegantly dressed gentleman floated down the marble steps towards him, introducing himself as the owner of the property. The gardener enquired, ""what do you do to afford such a place?"" The man quietly replies ""I am a purveyor of fine women and owner of many gentleman's clubs.""

A pimp then, thinks the gardener, and off he went about his day's work.

As the day grew late, and home time grew near, the gardener set about watering a patch of grass just at the side of the front steps. The elegant man came out, insisting that he would water the grass himself. The gardener obliged and went home.

Upon his return later that week, the gardener found that the elegant man had left the hose in an awful state, kinked and un-coiled, and, being a rather particular gardener, threw it over his shoulder and stormed into the house in a fit of rage.

As he stormed in, he saw the elegant man back-hand a woman that clearly worked for him.

The gardener threw down the burden from his shoulder and said ""I simply cannot work for a man that treats his hose like this.""",The Particular Gardener (OC),5

And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg.  Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.

 And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?""And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?""

And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).""

Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.

To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).

And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.

And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are.""

And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""  ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.

Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.

 It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).

 That is how it all began. And that's the truth.

The museum had announced a new exhibit and he was extremely excited to be one of the first people to ever see it, since he got some early access tickets. When he got there, there were about 12 other people who had also gotten a ticket for today, so he assumed that it was going to be a pretty private experience.

After about 10 minutes of waiting, a guide led the 13 of them to a dark room, where they had a presentation of what this new exhibit was going to be. A man walked up to the podium, and began to present his slides.

“Ladies and gentlemen, archeologists have found one of the most mind-boggling discoveries ever, and we have the privilege to be one of the first museums in the world to have a full-fledge exhibit for the public to learn about this incredible moment in human history.” 

He rambles on for a while and then finally gets to his point.

“Fellow history buffs, we have uncovered an ancient man’s entire estate, that is *made of excrement.*”

Joe was shocked. Baffled at how incredibly ridiculous this was. However, as the presentation went on, he became more and more intrigued. The presenter went on to talk about how the man who they believe to have made his estate had uses his own poop, his animals poop, and any other excrement he could find to forge his tiny ‘cabin’ and stables for his farm animals. The presenter then finished his presentation and led the 13 of them to the newly built exhibit.

The exhibit was completely full of information on how he used feces to mold it into whatever he wanted and form many things. It also goes on to stating that the general smell of his estate could be smelled from miles away, and the estate itself was able to ward off any other raiders, who just couldn’t stand the smell. It also went on to assume that the man in question had anosmia (total loss of smell) but the cause for it is unknown.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the most exciting part of the tour,” said the tour guide as he grabbed the attention of the small audience. “We actually have a piece of the fossilized excrement here in house. And we are excited to reveal it to you first.” He then led the group to a curtain that had been blocking part of the room.

The tour guide then pulled back the curtain to reveal a tall, skinny object that was made completely of very old feces. Around 4.5 foot tall. The presenter then told us that this object was more than likely used as a prop to hold up the fence that the ancient man built for his farm.

After hearing this, Joe examined the object and then looked up at the huge sign that labeled the exhibit piece.

*“This is a shit post”*",Joe visits his favorite museum's new exhibit.,34

She just chuckles a bit and thinks who would be so stupid to buy him. After a few minutes curiosity takes over her and turns back to the man. When she gets there she asks the  man ""How could be this small dog  a warrior??"". The man answers "" He is the most dangerous one among them"" - says the man - ""You just have to command him in a proper way"" 

The man places a small tool besides the dog and says the command properly : Warrior dog, warrior dog, STOOL!!

There once were twin boys, age six, that had developed extreme personalities. One was a pessimist and the other a total optimist. Concerned, their parents took them to a psychiatrist.

First, the psychiatrist treated the pessimist. Trying to brighten his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room filled with toys. But instead of yelping with delight, the little boy burst into tears. “What’s the matter?” the psychiatrist asked. “Don’t you want to play with any of the toys?”

“Yes,” the little boy bawled, “but if I did I’d only break them.”

Next, the psychiatrist treated the optimist. Trying to dampen his out look, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with horse manure. But instead of wrinkling his nose in disgust, the optimist climbed to the top of the pile, and began gleefully digging out scoop after scoop with his bare hands.

“What are you doing?” the baffled psychiatrist asked.

A Canadian park ranger is giving some ramblers a warning about bears, “Brown bears are usually harmless. They avoid contact with humans so we suggest you attach small bells to your rucksacks and give the bears time to get out of your way. However, grizzly bears are extremely dangerous. If you see any grizzly-bear droppings leave the area immediately.”

“So how do we know if they’re grizzly bear droppings?” asks one of the ramblers.

A young monk arrives at the monastery. He is assigned to helping the other monks in copying the old laws of the church by hand. He notices, however, that all of the monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript. So, the new monk goes to the head monk to question this, pointing out that if someone made even a small error in the first copy, it would never be picked up! In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.

The head monk, says, “You make a good point, my son.”

He goes down into the dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are held in a locked vault. Hours go by and nobody sees the head monk. The young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him banging his head against the wall and wailing.

Well, he'd eventualy come to a rocky patch of land, and hit a particularly large one.

The airbag had saved him, but that was it for his car.

So, pondering on what to do, and looking at the mechanical meter which tracks the miles traveled, (an old compulsion of his) he came to the conclusion that he couldn't be more than 30 miles from the town he'd last bought gasoline in.

It was starting to get late, but the doors were great ventilation, and the car roof provided shelter from the hot sun, so he spent the night in his car, determined to find his way back during the light hours.

As the sun began to rise, the Man had a startling realization.

He had drunk all of his water while driving around, and didn't have a drop to spare.

But, he realized, he might as well bring something, and so he filled his water bottle with wiper fluid, it was a rich, tempting blue.

He applied some sun-block, grabbed an umbrella, and set off in the direction he thought he came from.

He walked all day, and as he walked, and walked, he began to wonder if he was heading in the right direction.

The click-clack of his shoes on the rocky land and the feeble swoosh~ of the wind over the rocks were the only sounds he could hear, and the lack of distraction gave him plenty of time to think about how he'd die.

He kept walking, more desperate to reach town than ever.

*Had* he passed that dry riverbed in the suv?

*Had* he driven over sandy dunes?

He had no certainty, but he thought he remembered doing doughnuts in the dunes, so he continued that way.

As night fell, he slowed down, and finally stopped.

He spent the night with the umbrella over his head, and his back on top of his shirt.

He felt sunburnt, in spite of the sunblock and umbrella.

He woke thirsty, incredibly so.

All he had seen were stubby little cactuses and dried shrubs, there was no way he'd get water before he reached town.

So he set out again, in the direction he *thought* was correct.

As he walked, that third sweltering day, the bottle of sloshing wiper fluid grew more and more tempting.

He knew the rule of threes.

Three minutes without air, three weeks without food, three days without *water,* then you die.

It was certainly possible to last longer, in the best case scenario.

But wandering through a sweltering, freezing desert was not the best case scenerio.

He had forgotten how cold the desert could get at night, and had been shivering while he tried to sleep.

He figured that if he didn't find town, today was his last day.

So on he marched, the click-clack of his shoes becoming a dull shuffle as he plodded on through the sand.

As he walked, he kept to the valleys between dunes, trying his best to stay in the shade as long as possible, but soon the sun was nearing its peak in the sky, and so he was forced to use the umbrella once more.

He re-applied his sunblock, and on he went, weak from dehydration and sunlight.

He came to what must have been the tallest dune yet, and decided to climb it, after all, he may as well have a look around, to see if town was nearby.

He'd travelled about 14 miles a day, so he must have come near it by now.

He lost his footing often, and he eventually gave up on standing, so on he crawled to the top of the dune.

At last, it's come to this, the hackneyed, cartoonish image of a man, crawling up a dune, alone in the desert, his clothes ragged, his beard even more so, and long as well.

Except he barely had the beginnings of a stubble, and his clothes were in decent condition, if a bit sandy.

Years from now, someone would find his dried up corpse, picked apart by scavengers, and wearing perfectly serviceable clothes.

All they would need is a good shake-out and a wash, and they would be good as new.

He would have laughed, if his throat wasn't so raw, and dry.

He was so near the top, but it was all too much, he felt terrible, and could barely breathe.

He decided to try some of the wiper fluid.

So he took a small mouthful, and swished it about, and swallowed a small amount by mistake, so he quickly spat out the rest.

It tasted awful, but he waited, hs mouth did feel slightly better, and his throat was a little less raw, he could certainly breathe again.

So on he crawled, up the rest of the way to the top of the dune.

He tried to hold his head high, but he was getting weaker, so he sat down in the sand, holding his umbrella over his head like a proper lady with her parasol.

He chuckled at that.

He looked out over the vast desert, and all he saw, for miles and miles, were dunes.

He had failed, this was it.

So, he decided to drink some more of the wiper fluid, he was sure they put something in it to keep winos from drinking it for the cheap alcohol content, but he was also sure it would just make you vomit, and he was dying anyway.

As he took a large swig of the refreshing blue liquid, he spotted something, and he immediately spat in surprise.

There was a large hole in the sand, a black spot in the middle of a valley in a circle of the dunes.

His dune was just beyond the edge of this valley.

It loojed to be hexagonal, or perhaps circular, but he didn't care, it looked made, *designed,* perhaps there he would find water.

So he began a mad crawl for the black spot, his umbrella forgotten, and his bottle in hand, he began a rapid tumble down the dune.

The sand was hot, and he curled and cowered, covering his face, especially his eyes.

He clamped his mouth tight-shut, and soon he had rolled to a stop, his body battered and scorched, with sand in places no sand should be.

He had stopped at the spot, which he now knew was a raised platform, and so he struggled to sit up, and to crawl onto it.

He slowly crept across the black stone, and perhaps his nerves had been fried with his skin, or perhaps he was at last beginning to hallucinate, but the stone almost felt-

*Cold.*

Here he was, in the middle of a desert, his watch reading noon, the sun high overhead, on a black stone, and it felt *cool.*

This was it, soon the beautiful women would come to serve him ice cold lemonade, or a cool beer, and he would say,

""Are you well?""

And they would say yes, and giggle, like him, an-

Wait.

He *heard* that, *he* didn't say it, somebody *else* said it to him!

He bolted upright, trying to see who had spoken.

As he looked around, his vision blurry, he blinked a couple of times, he turned, and then, he saw it.

In the stone was a carving, seated beneath some kind of glossy coating like one sees on a dining table.

It looked like a massive tree, reduced perfectly to two dimensions, somehow encases in the stone.

And from the trunk of the tree, in the center of the platform, rose a knot in the bark, a gnarled lump of stone which looked perfectly real, and from this massive knot rose a white post.

The post sat at an angle, about forty-five degrees, and from down in the knot, a long snake rose up, and laid itself across the post, lazily staring at him.

He scooted back in fright, the snake was *massive,* it must have been 15 feet long at least!

He knew from descriptions by the locals that this was a rattle snake, but he heard no rattling whatsoever.

Perhaps it was someone's pet, and so it wasn't alarmed by him?

That would explain the voice.

His throat once more dry, he wrestled with his water bottle, and managed to swallow some of the ghastly stuff.

His voice came out, feeble and dusty.

""H-hello, is someone there? I-s this your pet snake? May I please have some water, I'd like to not be thirsty anymore, please!""

He drew a final, ragged breath, and he heard the voice say, 

""Coming up.""

And just as he lost consciousness, he saw the snake rear its head, and lunge for his shoulder, and he felt it bite him.

""-tter?""

His head was pounding, but he felt almost delightful, aside from the pain in his shoulder.

""¿Whuh,"" he grunted out, seeking a repeat.

""Mister, as I said, are you feeling better?""

He bolted upright, a scream of agony on his lips, and so he screamed, or at least he tried to.

Water burst from his mouth, pouring out over the cool stone, and pooling in the sandy valley around it.

It seemed to frighten his unseen companion, who didn't speak at all.

He tried to scream until his throat was raw, only able to pitifully froth and gargle, so he gave up, swallowing instead.

It felt good to swallow the water, though it was not exactly cold, it was cool enough to be refreshing.

Once he'd had his fill, it stopped flowing.

He could speak.

""I feel better now, no thanks to the snake bite.""

He heard a chuckle.

""Terribly sorry, but that's just how I am.""

Now his vision was somewhat clear, the snake was talking.

His misery forgeotten, he spoke.

""Can I ask you a question? How are you doing that? Talking, I mean. What do you mean that's how you are? Why did you save me? What *is* this place?""

The snake grinned.

""That's five questions, but I'll try my best to answer them all.""

""First, *Jack,* you may *indeed* ask me questions.""

Jack shuddered at the mention of his name.

""Second, I have no Idea how I talk, just as I have no idea how you got here, why you were born, or what my purpose truly is.""

""Third, well, I'll return to that.""

The snake winked.

""Fourth, because you *asked* me to.""

""Fifth, I can't tell you, not yet.""

The snake shook his rattle, and slithered up to Jack, coiling around him and finally resting his head on Jack's shoulder.

""For the sake of convenience, and in the interest of courtesy, My name is Nathan, but you can call me Nate.""

Jack shifted slightly, and looked into Nate's eye.

""Where did you get your name, Nate?""

Nake flicked out his tongue.

""Samuel gave it to me. He believed anything that can talk should have a name, and so he gave me mine. I really liked Samuel, so I'm quite happy to have it.""

Jack could hear as much from Nate's words.

""Now, before you start asking more questions, might I suggest making another request? I'm certain you just drank quite a lot of wiper fluid, so I think you should hurry, before it makes you blind.""



This one's a *really* long story, and I have other things to do.

I'll try to keep updating it to completion, when I have free-time.","So, there's a man crawling through the desert.",0

The cat was trying to drink water that had spilt on the tarmac near it. The boy saw that the tarmac was dirty, and was worried that the cat would get sick if it kept drinking the water. He started to slowly walk towards the cat while taking out his water bottle from his school bag. Once he got close enough to the cat, he unscrewed the cap of his bottle, poured water into it, and laid the cap down on the tarmac for the cat to sip from. 

The cat looked at the cap full of water, and after hesitating for a moment, the cat began to lick the water from the cap. The boy did this a few times for the cat before noticing a tag on its neck. He bent down to look at the tag. The tag read: “Daisy”, and had an address on it. The boy knew that the address was only a 15 minute walk from where he was now. The boy pet the cat and then picked it up, and began walking to the owner’s house. 

After about 15 minutes, the boy finally arrived at the house. He let the cat down so that he could knock on the door. He heard light footsteps approaching the door before the door suddenly opened. A girl that he recognised was standing behind the door. It was a girl from his school that he had seen walking around before. Before the boy could take say anything, the cat meowed behind him and the girl’s smile turned into shock. “Daisy!” She cried in relief as she went around the boy to pick up her cat. 

The boy turned around to the sight of the girl on the floor hugging her cat. “I found him on my way back to school” said the boy. The girl said that the cat had been missing for almost a week. She was relieved. The girl said thank you and pulled the boy in for a hug. His cheeks had turned bright red and he was embarrassed to pull away from the hug, because he knew she would be able to notice. The boy went back home, heart still fluttering from the experience. 

For the rest of the school year, the boy was too shy to approach her and he graduated high school without talking to her again. He went to college at a place where none of his friends had gone. He was alone and had to try to make friends. When he entered his first class, he was surprised to see the girl sitting in the front row by herself. He had no excuses not to sit next to her. He sat down and asked her: “How is Daisy?”. She turned around, at first looking confused, but then she smiled when she recognised him. “She’s great!” She said not knowing what else to say, only knowing she was happy to see him. The boy looked at her and her smile, and it looked just as beautiful as the day he returned her cat. This was the beginning of their relationship. 

15 years later, they had been married for 6 years, and they still had Daisy. The girl had been fighting cancer for the past year. The boy would be by her side as she underwent the treatments. The doctors told him she didn’t have much time left. The boy would lie at her side as she rested and when she was awake, he would talk to her all night, reminiscing all their years together. Unfortunately their time together was cut short. She passed away when they were both 33 on February 14th. 

The girl’s last words before entering her final sleep were: “I love you, darling. Please take care of Daisy when I’m gone”. The boy wept hearing these words and would weep more the next morning. Some time passed and the boy stopped being sad. He realised that he shouldn’t be sad that she was gone, instead he should be happy she was ever here. Even though the boy had lost his wife, he could still stroke her pussy everyday.",A Valentine’s Day story,25

Peeping out from between the trees, he saw a female elephant weeping in distress, so he swaggered up to her and said ""It's okay, chill, I'm not gonna hurt you.""  

And the elephant looked down her trunk and said, ""It's not you, little guy, I trod on a splinter and I can't get it out of my foot, and it really hurts and I don't know what to do.""  

So the mouse said, ""Okay, how about I take a look at it?"" and the elephant lifted her foot and sure enough, there was a splinter, big enough to hurt but far too small for an elephant to get a grip on. So telling the elephant to hold it right there for a moment, the mouse reached up, dug his sharp little teeth in the huge splinter (huge to him, anyway) and braced himself, and with a couple of good pulls it was out.   

The elephant tested the injury carefully and found she could put weight on it again, and said ""Thank you so much - if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.""  

""Well,"" said the mouse, ""just between the two of us, I've always wondered what it would be like to bang an elephant - what do you say?""  

Tickled by the cheek of the request, and thinking it would be no great imposition at that, the elephant graciously agreed, and squatting a little, she was able to lower her tail within reach so that the mouse could scamper up it, and pretty soon he was commencing operations and banging away vigorously.  

A passing gorilla, offended by this licentious display, crossly seized a chunk of fallen branch and bounced it off the elephant's head before loping off into the trees, at which the outraged elephant squealed in pain and surprise. Whereupon, without missing a beat, the mouse, eyes screwed tight shut, yelled:  

""Yeah, *take* it, bitch! Take it *all*!""",A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood,4

So he called for all of his subordinates, and announced a new prestigious title to which all are given candidacy; the title of “Duke of the Best Joke”.

&amp;nbsp;

Not wanting to disappoint, Finance Minister Granger immediately ordered a search for the most expensive comedian in the land. But alas, the comedian could not even manage a giggle from the High King.

&amp;nbsp;

Garrett, Head of Tourism, brought a team of horses to the castle square, where they jumped over hurdles of fire, balanced on large balls, and performed many other tricks. Yet Eldarion yawned. This was not what he was looking for.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, it was Oswar’s turn, Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was well known that Oswar had a knack for negotiation, and was very well liked as the ambassador of the Reunited Kingdom. Much of the peace was owed to him. After racking his brains and using his connections, he brought a group of Ents with him. Each Ent held in his hand a Palantir, the Crystal Ball used for long range communication that is now mass produced under the rule of Eldarion.

The High King gave a puzzled look at the Ents communicating with each other through the Palantiri, before uncontrollably laughing and falling off his throne. Before long everyone was laughing at the sight.

&amp;nbsp;

And so it came to be, that Oswar was conferred the title. It became known across Middle Earth that how Minister Oswar won the title of the Best Joke is Intercom Ents.","Eldarion, son of Aragorn, High King of the Reunited Kingdom, was bored.",50

""Horns or Tail""

This time, tha awnser's ""Tail"". The demon then bend the guy over, and sticks a red tail right in between the man buttcheeks. He lets out a sonorous ""Ouch"" as a single tear rolls down his face.

The Jehovah's Witness awnsers ""Tail"", and as expected, the demon bends him over and sticks a red tail in the aforementioned spot. He lets out an ""Ouch"" aswell and a single tear rolls down his face, as he starts walking towards hell.

Once inside he finds that a dance party is taking place, with all kinds of sinners and damnated people dancing with joy. He decides to get to the dance floor and start dancing, ""I'll be here forever"" he thinks ""might aswell enjoy it"". He dances like never before, to music never heard before. And as he's having the time of his life, the movement causes the tail to fall off. Not wanting to feel out of place, he picks it up and puts it again between his buttcheeks. He resumes dancing, but a few moments later the tail falls off once again. And so, he picks it up and places it in his bottom. This goes on for a while, the tail falling off and the Jehovah's witness picking it up and putting it in its place. The music is loud and the lights shift in all tones of red.

Suddenly, he wakes up. He is on a room of what seems a cheap motel. He remembers that he's on a pilgrimage trip out of town. He looks to the side and finds his partner sleeping on the right side of the bed, with a smile on his face. As the pain on his posterior intensifies, he connects the dots and decides to wake his partner up to confront him.

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it for a second, Galem replied, ""ya know, buddy, you're right. You deserve this. You take this win and I'll pull up right behind you. You've been a great friend, it's the least I can do!""

&amp;#x200B;

As they're getting ready to start the race, Gollum is ecstatic. He's actually going to win one! This is his day! Finally, after an eternity, the gun fires and the gates fly open. They're off! In true fashion, they jump out in front of everyone and firmly build their lead. It's neck and neck! Galem and Gollum! Back and forth! Everyone is on the edge of their seats, it's one of the most exciting races they've seen! As the finish line approaches, Galem falls back and Gollum moves to the front. His moment is finally here! He's going to win! But right before they cross the finish line, Galem slingshots up and takes the win. Gollum is furious!

&amp;#x200B;

""What the hell, man?"" Gollum raged as they got back to the stables. ""You said this would be my win!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Dude, I am so, so, sorry. I got lost in the moment and forgot! Tell ya what, tomorrow is the last race of our career before we retire. You can win that one. You can go out with your first victory!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah! I like that!"" Gollum replies. His anger fades and he starts to concentrate on the upcoming race.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, they're back in the gates and Gollum is practically salivating over his impending win. The gun fires, the gates open, and they're off! Just like before, it's neck and neck, back and forth! Galem and Gollum, Galem and Gollum! As the finish line approaches, Gollum is sure he's got this. But! Just like the previous day, Galem swoops ahead and takes the win by a hair. Gollum feels his spirit break as he realizes that he will end his career without a single win to his name.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later, Galem and Gollum are relaxing at the farm that they both retired to, enjoying the spoiled treatment that they are being lavished with, when Gollum speaks up:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey man. I still don't know what it feels like to win. But I still want to know. Can we have one more race? One that doesn't matter for points or ranking or anything like that? Just you and me around this barn. And please, just this once, let me win. It's all I've ever wanted.""

&amp;#x200B;

Golum immediately replied, ""absolutely, friend. I still feel bad for how I treated you when we were racing and I want to make it up to you. We'll start at dawn, race until we can't race any more, and you'll know what it's like to feel that sweet, sweet victory.""

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, as the sun barely started peeking over the horizon, both horses shot out of the barn like bullets. Around and around they went, kicking up dust and dirt and grabbing the attention of every other farm animal within earshot. Back and forth, back and forth, Galem and Gollum, Galem and Gollum. Just like old time! As they put the laps behind them and the finish line approached, Gollum was firmly in the lead. His victory was close! But, just like before, Galem swung ahead and took the win. Gollum couldn't believe what had just happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Gollum stomped his way up to a nearby chicken and started to rage, ""can you believe that? What nerve! He said he would let me win! And he didn't! Even in a race with no prize!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

To which the chicken, with confusion in his eyes, replied:

""Holy sh\*t, a talking horse!""

One of my best friends aunts is a nun, so he invited me to go with him. I went once, immediately got hooked, and now we go every Tuesday night.  I told my wife that I had to work late Tuesday nights, then me friend and I would go place bets on the nuns. 

Eventually my wife got suspicious and thought that I was having an affair.  When she confronted me about it, I had no other option but to tell her about the fight club. Obviously she didn’t believe me, so I told her I’d bring her with us the next time we went. 

Tuesday rolled around, and the three of us went to the nunnery. To my wife’s astonishment, when we walked in, two of the sisters were going at it while men cheered them on from all sides. 

We watched the rest of the fight, and it was a brutal one. In the end, one of the sisters landed a mean uppercut that knocked the other one out. The crowd erupted in cheers.  Out of nowhere, the nun that one ran up to me and kissed me right on the mouth in celebration.  Time froze, and my wife couldn’t believe what was happening before her eyes, and she stormed out. That night my wife left me, and I haven’t seen her since. 

So that’s the story of how my wife things I’m having an affair with a nun.

She relayed that she wanted to find a woman to date, to woo, and to romance. She wanted to find another stable partner to add to our marriage.

After she laid all of this on me, I became curious—especially having never considered this proposition before.

I told her I was proud of her for expressing her feelings. I said, “Sweetie, I really appreciate this step forward in your personal growth. You’ve never done something like this before. I feel like this a great moment for you.”

 The man thinks to himself  ""Oh how bad could it be?"", and decides to go over to his girlfriend's house. He decides to take his old cycle to go to her house, but the downside was that everytime it rained, he had to grease the chains so that it wouldn't get stuck. He decides to carry some Vaseline along with him incase it rained. 

When he reaches his girlfriend house, he notices that everyone indeed is quiet and no one's making any sound. ""They must be taking it seriously then"", he thinks to himself, and he sits at the dining table for dinner. He has a look at the sink and sure enough, there was a pile of unwashed dishes, and a very unpleasant odour coming from them. Slightly weirded out, he turns his attention to the food that was served and begins to eat. He realises that he can take advantage of the non-speaking situation and under the table, slides his had up his girlfriend's leg and begins to finger her. Seeing that no one said anything, he take it one step further and undresses her right there, infront of everyone and starts fucking her. The mother is horrified and the father beings fuming with anger, but neither of them say anything, keeping the challenge in mind. The man takes complete advantage of this and proceeds to even undress the mother and starts fucking her too! The father, now filled with utter rage, tries to keep his mouth shut with all his power, as he absolutely did not want to touch the disgustingly dirty dishes.

 Suddenly, they hear the loud rumble of thunder, and it starts to rain outside. The man immediately remembers about his cycle, and pulls out the container of Vaseline that he brought to grease his cycle's chain. The father sees this and screams :

""Stop right there! I'll do the dishes and even clean the entire house! Just don't come near me!""",A Rainy Day.,32

""Gentlemen,"" he says, ""my horse is right outside and I need to go to the toilet right now. When I come back, I will go check outside and, if my horse is not there, it will mean everything will have to be just as it was that time when I was in Texas. Don't let it happen here.""

Without saying a word more, the cowboy walks to the toilet and closes the door. Every single person in there starts talking between them and asking 'what was it that happened in Texas?' non-stop without getting an answer from anybody. The bartender certainly didn't know, and it seemed as if nobody had gotten any news yet of what happened in Texas the time the cowboy was there.

The cowboy is taking too long and everybody almost start panicking and praying for whatever happened in Texas not to happen in there. They get progressively more agitated each minute that passes. The fear in that room grows so strong that nobody leaves his seat or wants to do it at all, not even to check if the horse is still outside or if anything happened with the cowboy.

Luckily, the cowboy comes out walking calmly and fixing his belt. The room gets quiet once again while the cowboy keeps walking towards the exit. He gets to the door, opens it and takes a step outside to check on his horse. With the room still in silence, the cowboy steps back in and looks around with a face of satisfaction.

""Gentlemen, you did well. My horse is still outside. Keep on drinking in peace. Farewell fellows.""

Everybody in the bar sigh in relief. As the cowboy walks outside and is climbing on his horse, a guy from the bar comes running to him.

""Sir,"" the guy says in haste, ""you put everybody in the room in deep anxiety for whatever happened in Texas. The tension could be felt in the air as nobody knew what was it that happened over there the time you where in Texas. Sir, please, could you tell me what was it that happened in Texas?""

""Oh,"" the cowboy exclaims, ""in Texas my horse was actually stolen.""",A cowboy is riding his horse in a small town and decides to stop at a bar to go to the toilet,21

Later, the boy hears them arguing again, picking out the phrase “penises and vaginas.” He then goes his dad to find out what this phrase means, to which has dad responds: “It means coats and hats.”

That evening, the family was getting ready to have guests over for dinner. He walks past his dad in the bathroom, who has just cut himself shaving. “SHIT!” he yells. The boy asks him what this new word means, and the father tells him it just means shaving cream.

Next he goes down to the kitchen where his mom is cutting the turkey for dinner. She accidentally nicks her finger with the knife and drops a loud f-bomb. Again, with his great sense of curiosity, the boy asks what that word means. “It just means cutting, honey.” the mom replied. 

Just then the guests arrived for dinner. The boy decides to go answer the door and let them inside. After they all come in, he proceeds to say to them: “Good evening, bitches and bastards. May I hang your penises and vaginas? My dad is in the bathroom wiping the shit off his face and my mom’s fucking the turkey!”

He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be.

He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him-he's done this many times before.

His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for an easy entrance. You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues.

""No, Sir!"" came the reply.

As a bagpiper, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost on the way and, being a typical man, didn't stop for directions. I finally arrived an hour late and found the funeral director had gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the grave diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. 

I played out my heart and soul for this poor man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before. And as I played ""Amazing Grace,"" the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together.

When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""",Amazing Grace,10
