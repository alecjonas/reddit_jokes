What exactly is your plan mr President?"" To which George w Bush says "" well we plan to bomb and kill 1,000,000,000 Iraqis and a big titty blonde woman"" the man, again in complete shock, replies ""Mr President I don't mean to question your strategy and reasoning, but why would you kill a big titty blonde woman??""

They walk around and come upon a shack. A giant log is leaned up against this shack and they think to themselves “PERFECT!” They walk back to the hole, stand the log up and shove it down the hole. They listen ... but never hear it hit the bottom. 

A few moments later they hear a goat. It’s running as fast as it can. It gets to the edge of the depression, jumps ... and does a NOSE DIVE down the whole. “BAAAAAaaaaaaaaa....” (but ... they never hear it hit the bottom).

So, they give up. This hole is just immeasurably deep. They walk through the forest a ways and then they come upon a farmer. 

Farmer: “Hey, fellas ... have you seen a goat anywhere around here?”

One day everything is going as normal and a pastor gets in the cab. He asks to go to the other side of town, and so they do. Almost immediately the taxi is stuck behind a cyclist who just doesn't go out of the way, but is going way too slow for motor traffic. After 20 minutes of torture finally a spot opens up to pass the cyclist. Even better, it's the perfect opportunity to knock that prick off the road onto the pavement. A few seconds before impact, though, the taxi driver remembers his passenger and decides he couldn't do such an evil thing in the company of a pastor. The taxi driver makes to pass the cyclist very closely, as to still scare him and suddenly the pastor darts towards the door and swings it open. The door hits the cyclist hard on the back and he's sent of flying over the road into a lantern post. Dumbfounded, the taxi driver looks at the pastor.

Since he wasn’t physically impaired he remained in the military and eventually became an Admiral.  


However, during his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.  

One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Gunnery Sergeant for his personal staff. 

The first Master Chief was a Surface Navy type and it was a great interview. 

At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?” 

The Master Chief answered, “Why yes. I couldn’t help but notice you are missing your starboard ear, so I don’t know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.” 

The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office. 

The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, “Well yes, you seem to be short one ear.” 

The Admiral threw him out also. 

The third interview was with the Marine Gunnery Sergeant . 

 He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Master Chiefs put together.  

The Admiral wanted this guy, but went ahead with the same question. 

“Do you notice anything different about me?” 

To his surprise the Gunnery Sergeant said, “Yes. You wear contact lenses.” 

The Admiral was impressed and thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. “And how do you know that?” the Admiral asked. 

The Gunny replied, “Well sir, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with only one ear.”","A young Naval Officer was in a terrible car accident,",16

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.

The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""

The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in this side of the planet and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in this village. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule'.""

The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?""

The farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up.""

The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. 

His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees !

His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. 

The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie.

Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet.

“OK,” he says,
“how about taking a stroll round there again and we can do it for old time sake?”
“Ooh Henry, you devil, that sounds like a good idea,” she answers.

He’s hanging on to her hips for dear life.This is the most athletic sex imaginable. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground.
The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life that he didn’t know.
After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, still watching thinks, that was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I’ve got to ask him what his secret is!
As the couple passes, he says to them,”That was something else! You must have been having sex for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? You must had a fantastic life together. Is there some sort of secret?”

EDIT: Grammar

Once on a quiet little farm, there lived a Little Horse. Every day he would watch the Big Horse, a racing mare, run outside doing laps along a track just outside the stable. One fine day while the horse was doing her daily practice a border collie, who was best friends with the Little Horse, came up to him to talk. ""What's wrong Little Horse?"", she asked, ""you look kind of down.""

""Miley"", said the Little Horse, ""for years and years and years and years and years, I have seen the big horse run around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. I want that kind of stamina. I want that kind of speed. I want to run like she does.""

""You might want to try asking her! She might know a few tricks. There she is, taking a break at the water barrel! Don't be shy! Go talk to her!""

""I guess it's worth a shot...""

With modesty in his heart, the Little Horse went up to the Big Horse while she was drinking from the water barrel, and said:

""Big Horse, for years and years and years and years and years, I have seen you run around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. What is your secret of staying so quick?""

""Easy"", said she, ""stay off of the carrots and potatoes, and eat plenty of fresh oats and hay. Be sure to do 100 laps a day, and give yourself plenty of sleep and an early start before the rooster crows.""

""Oh, thank you! Thank you!"" said the Little Horse, ""I will do everything you say, and someday I'll be as fast as you!""

The Little Horse galloped happily away. The Big Horse took another drink, and whispered ""that'll be the day...""

For a full year, the Little Horse did exactly as the Big Horse said. He got a restful 9 hours of sleep from 8 to 5, before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. The owner of the farm, surprised to see the little horse up so early, attempted to reward her with freshly picked potatoes and carrots. The Little Horse backed away timidly, remembering what the Big Horse said. The farmer left the vegetables on the ground by the Little Horse's stable, and I am happy to say that they were never eaten, although they gave an awful smell. The farmer's wife had to take them away, and gave the farmer a scolding after doing so. Although the Little Horse couldn't quite get to 100 at first, he started at 20, then at 30, then at 40, and so on until he could do 100 laps per day for almost 3 seasons. At last, he finished the 366 days (it was a leap year) with 324 laps without getting tired! (Give or take one or two.) He whinnied triumphantly! ""Finally I'm ready!""

The Little Horse went up to the Big Horse, still drinking from the water barrel after doing laps, and said to her:

""Big Horse, for years and years and years and years and years, I have seen you run around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. Today, thanks to your advice, I have become like you. I stayed off of the carrots and potatoes the farmer tried to give me and instead ate plenty of fresh oats and hay. I didn't do 100 laps at first, but I got from 20, to 30, to 40, eventually 100, with my record now sitting at 325 without getting tired (give or take one or two). I also gave myself 9 hours of sleep every day from 8 to 5, before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. I would love to show you my speed! Let me show you how fast I am!""

I am sorry to say that the Big Horse was not at all impressed or flattered by what the Little Horse had said, but was instead rather annoyed to be talking to the Little Horse, blathering on about farmers, and records, and hours of sleep. However, she did not want anyone else to scold her for sending the Little Horse away, so she said, ""Alright! Show me your paces!""

The Little Horse ran fast as lighting around and around the track. All of the other animals gazed as the Little Horse ran round and round the track quick as a motorbike without struggle. They whispered to each other in awe: ""He's amazing!"" ""He's marvelous!"" ""Colossal!"" ""Stupendous!"" ""He's a champion!""

It was at ""champion"" when the Big Horse yelled ""All right that's enough!"" The Little Horse stopped dead in his tracks. The Big Horse, with a face as red as the sun, went up to the Little Horse and said:

""Little Horse, I know that for years and years and years and years and years, you've seen me run around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. I know that thanks to my stupid advice, you have become like me (or so you say). You stayed off of the carrots and potatoes the farmer tried to give you and instead ate plenty of fresh oats and hay. I know you didn't do 100 laps at first (you must have been fat), but you got from 20, to 30, to 40, eventually 100, with your record now sitting at 322 without getting tired (give or take one or two), and you also gave yourself 9 hours of sleep every day from 8 to 5, before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. I've had enough blathering about farmers, records, and hours of sleep. I've also had enough about the animals calling you a champion when you're most obviously not. It's degrading! Go away and don't steal my rightful title!""

The Little Horse was shattered. He did not expect to have his hero call him out in this way. He stood in silence for a bit, and began to tear up. He held them back, and yelled at the Big Horse, saying:

""You are nothing like I had imagined you would be! You're stuck up and rude! You might run fast, but you don't have the manners for it!""

The Big Horse turned to him. ""Oh yeah? Well at least I can still run faster than you!""

""How about a race? If I win, I become the new race horse!""

""Well if I win, I'll make sure you never run on this farm again!""

The Little Horse hesitated. ""You're on! One week! The track! Be there!""

The farm animals gasped. They didn't expect to see a challenge like this in their lifetime, let alone from a Little Horse like him. The border collie went up to the Little Horse: ""Are you sure you want to go through with this? This is a real tall order, and I don't want to see you go.""

The Little Horse said ""Miley, for years and years and years and years and years, I've seen the Big Horse run around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. I know that thanks to his advice, I've stayed off of the carrots and potatoes the farmer tried to give me and instead ate plenty of fresh oats and hay. I know I didn't do 100 laps at first (I must have been careless), but I got from 20, to 30, to 40, eventually 100, with my record now sitting at 326 without getting tired (give or take one or two), and I also gave yourself 9 hours of sleep every day from 8 to 5, before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. But you know something: I've had enough blathering about farmers, records, and hours of sleep. I've also had enough about the animals calling me a champion when I'm most obviously not. I'm going to earn that title! I'm going to beat that Big Horse in the race! But first I need to practice. I need to practice harder than I ever had before.""

So the Little Horse worked harder in a week than he had ever worked in a whole year. Thanks to his scheduling, he gave himself 10 hours of sleep every day from 6 to 4, way before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. The farmer had usually given the Little Horse oats and hay to eat every day instead of fresh potatoes and carrots, but this time the Little Horse had stuck with green grass instead. The farmer was puzzled, but even more so when his wife came to him with 4 bags of oats, and scolding him about that and a large pile of uneaten hay in the Little Horse's stable. The Little Horse had done 300 laps, just as he did every day, but counted himself up through the days. It was the same at first, but then it was 350... 400... 475... then on the last day, the Little Horse gave a miraculous 546 without getting tired! (give or take 3 or 5). The Little Horse cried out to the setting sun: ""Watch out Big Horse, here I come!""

The race was about to start. All of the animals were lined up against the fences. The Little Horse was waiting at the starting line, until at last the Big Horse showed up.

""You're up early this morning"", he said.

""I am, and I've been up, ready for this race.""

""You want to back out now, before you make the biggest mistake of your life? I might spare you the humiliation and exile, you know.""

""You can forget it, Big Horse. I'm ready to beat you.""

The gopher started the race. ""First one to 50 laps is the winner!"" The Little Horse smiled: he could do it in his sleep! The Big Horse scooted her hooves on the ground: she always did this before a big race.

The gopher held up his arm. ""On your mark... get set...

...GO!""

Boy what a race it was! The Little Horse got neck and neck with the Big Horse for a full 30 laps. A year and a week ago from today, the Little Horse would have never gotten this far, lucky to even get 10 laps before the Big Horse would beat him, and here he was racing against her, by a nose! Cows were mooing and stomping! Sheep were baaing and shaking! The farmer's wife had even gone outside to see the commotion, and scolded the farmer on what a terrible job he was doing to keep the noise down around here! It truly was very exciting.

It was until the next lap that the Big Horse got a little extra lead. Then a little more. And a little more. The Little Horse tried, but he just couldn't keep up with the Big Horse. This is where the Little Horse had made his mistake: he had counted laps instead of time. Rather than test out how fast he could run, he had tested how far. Thus, he didn't challenge himself for speed, and had instead challenged himself for stamina. The Little Horse realized this mistake, but only too late: the Big Horse had beaten the Little Horse by a full lap.

The Big Horse galloped in triumph! She beamed in selfish glee, taking a victory lap, and said:

""You see who is the champion, Little Horse! You see who is the true race horse! Now, it is time for you to keep up your end of the bargain: leave this place, and never come back!""

The Little Horse, sadder than he had ever been, even sadder than he had been a week ago when the Big Horse insulted him, bowed his head down in defeat, and walked out into the pasture. The other animals felt so sorry for the Little Horse, and were very angry at the Big Horse. No one had talked to her for weeks and weeks on end. The Big Horse took no notice at first, but eventually her habits begun to change. 

Every morning the Big Horse would wake up promptly at noon, far after the rooster crowed. She stopped eating oats and hay, and had instead accepted candy and ice cream from the children who came to visit her every day (you can imagine what the farmer's wife must think about that). The Big Horse would usually race around the track doing many laps, but no one had come to see her. She went down to 200. 100. 50. 20. 10. Eventually, she did not practice at all for many days. She lost races. She became very fat. Her manager came by discussing of selling her off to another farm. The Big Horse was heartbroken, and had no one to share it with. ""I just want someone to talk to...""

It was then that her wishes were answered: the border collie Miley went up to the Big Horse. The Big Horse looked up. Miley hesitated for a while, then spoke.

""Big Horse, I know you get tired of hearing about the Little Horse... but he sees you as a hero. For years and years and years and years and years, Little Horse has seen you running around the track outside, faster than any animal or any machine, and for hours and hours and hours without getting tired. He loves you so and thanks to your advice, he's stayed off of the carrots and potatoes the farmer tried to give him and instead ate plenty of fresh oats and hay. He didn't do 100 laps at first (you have to start somewhere), but he got from 20, to 30, to 40, eventually 100, with his record now sitting at 551 without getting tired (give or take 3 or 5), and he also gave himself 10 hours of sleep every day from 6 to 4, way before the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. But you know something: I can see you've had enough blathering about farmers, records, and hours of sleep. And I see that none of the animals are calling you a champion, and I can see you're not at the moment, unfortunately. Regardless, the Little Horse did everything for you, and all you did was send him away. I plead you, no I BEG you, go back to the Little Horse. Tell him all is not lost. Tell him he may not be the fastest, but he's an amazing horse regardless. He won't listen to me, but he might listen to... his hero...

Please... just go out and find him... we miss him so...""

The Big Horse looked quizzical, and said ""Gee, a talking dog.""",The Little Horse: An Inspirational Children's Story,14

Man 1: Well, you see, when your homeless and have nothing to eat this is sometimes what we have to resort to

Lawyer: I see, that's no way to live, why don't you come over to my place and I'll get you something to eat

Man 1: Id love to but me and my family of 3 couldn't possibly take up that offer

He then points to his family who are under a tree, also eating grass. The lawyer notices and then goes up to the other man

Lawyer: You couldn't possibly turn down a nice meal at my place could you?

The other man looks pitifully at the lawyer and replies, ""I would love to but me and my family with 6 kids couldn't possibly take an offer like that."" He then points over to another tree where is family too, is also eating grass.

After some convincing of the 2 men and their families, the lawyer guides them to his limousine which they all get in, it's a little tight however as fitting that many people in a limousine is a rather tough task to accomplish.

Once they are all settled in, one of the men look at the lawyer and say, ""I really appreciate you taking this time to help us get a good meal that we really need during these tough times"". The lawyer then replies

So this guy was driving through the desert, it was a hot day and his car was an old junker. About 5 miles outside of town the car finnally kicks the bucket. So, with no other choice, the guy begins to walk to town. After what feels like hours the guy stumbles upon an oasis in the middle of some dunes.

At the center of this oasis is a lever with a snake on it. The man approaches the snake, curious but afraid at the same time. As he approaches the snake begins to speak to him: ""Hello friend, my name is Nate. I am the protector of this lever here. This lever is the most dangerous in the world. If you were to switch it you would destroy the world and life as we know it. I'm supposed to kill anyone who stumbles upon this place, but this is your lucky day. I have a proposition for you: Take my son with you back to the city, let him explore it with you, teach him the way of life and this world so that when the time comes that he needs to replace me he will understand what he is protecting.

The man agrees and takes Nate's son back with him to the city. Every few months they both drive back to tell nate all that they have seen and explored until one day the man receives a message that Nate needs to see him and his son immediately; he is dying. So they get into the man's car and make haste to get to Nate before its too late. The man knows his way to the oasis now since they have been driving to and from it frequently. As he is cresting the final dune to get into the oasis the worst possible thing happens: the breaks go out on his car. As the car is racing down the dune at a high rate of speed the man looks up and notices that he is headed straight for the lever. But Nate isn't on the lever he is curled up a few feet to the side of the lever. The man is left with two choices: 1) Run over the lever and destroy the world and life as he knows it or 2) Run over Nate with his son in the car and ruin any chance that Nate has to pass on his duty to his son. The man didn't have much time to think but made a desicion:

Better Nate, then lever. ",It's worth it,25

Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."" Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise? ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.
""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.
Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?"" His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?",''My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave'',149

And somewhere along the way, they get into an argument -- as they always did -- about who among the three should host dinner that night. You see, they're all very passionate dinner hosts. 

One of the mohels says ""You should come to my house, I have the most beautiful house in the village!"" 

The other mohel says ""No, you should come to my house. I am the best chef in the village."" 

Then the vicar goes ""No, you should both come to my house. I have the best wine!"" 
This bickering goes on for about 20 minutes, until finally in the heat of the moment, the vicar yells ""Very well! We shall decide who the host his, with the cards."" 

""So it shall be god's will."" says one of the mohels. 
And so, they all start playing. It's an intense game. Many mind tricks, bluffs, everyone plays to the top of their abilities. An hour passes. Two. Then in the third hour, the vicar lays down his cards to the dismay of both of the mohels. A royal flush. Both the mohels were practically blown away. The perfect hand!

""Impossible!"" says one. 

""It is god's will."" the other shrugs.

""Then so you shall come to my house!"" said the vicar, pleased with his luck.. And to the vicar, went the mohels",Two Mohels and a Vicar are playing cards,10

Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered a baby girl. ""Hold that lantern up, don't set it down there's another one!"" said the doctor. Within a few minutes he had delivered a third baby.

""No, don't be in a hurry to put down that lantern, it seems there's yet another one coming!"" cried the doctor.

In the chaos of storming the beach he drops his rifle. Panicing, he runs to his Sergent and tells him what happened. The Sergent hands him a peice of driftwood and says ""Now anytime you see a Kraut, just point this stick a him and should 'bangity bang bang'""! Our intrepid marine is doubtful, but he follows orders, and next time he sees a German he points the stick at him and shouts ""bangity bang bang""!


To the marine's shock, the German falls over dead. The marine pushes further up the beach, and sees another German. Bangity bang bang! Again, he falls over dead. The marine pushes forward onto the farmland behind the beach and kills a few more Germans in this fashion. He spots a particularly portly German approaching from over a hill - ""bangity bang bang""! The German keeps on running at him. ""Bangity bang bang! Bangity bang bang!!!""


To the marine's dismay the German keeps running, undeterred. As he gets closer, the marine can hear the German saying ""tankity tank tank"".",A marine hits the beach on D-Day,4

He sits upright and looks out the window and knows immediately that it came from the temple next door. He curses himself for moving to such a stupid location, but it was his first night in the house and after all, he had no way of knowing this would happen before he moved in. 

In the morning he goes over to the temple and asks them to explain the noise he heard last night. The Head Monk explains to him quite plainly that he can’t say what the noise was because it was part of the sacred monk initiation ritual and only monks could know the origin of the screaming. The man is, of course, annoyed at this response but accepts it, mutters something about “stupid monks” and goes home. 

That night, the same thing happens again. He is awoken by the scream and is frustrated enough that he goes back to the temple in the morning and asks to be a monk. The Head Monk says that he is pleased that the man would like to join their order and explains that there is just one task that the man must complete in order to join (and he confirms that the man will learn the cause of the screaming as well). The task is to unlock the blue door with this key, the monk says, and hands the man a perfectly normal looking key. 

The man is a little confused, but, more or less excited to see what the screaming is coming from.

So the monk leads the man into a small, square room with a door on one edge and a beautiful table in the middle, maybe 1 ft square and 4 ft off the ground. The door is red, but the man only has the one key so he tries to unlock it anyway. Much to his surprise, the door unlocks and opens but the key disappears only to magically reappear back on the table. No matter, the man thinks, he goes and grabs the key and walks through the red door into another room. 

This room has a green door in it, so the man once again unlocks the door, loses the key and sees that its back on the table. He knows he’ll need it for the blue door at least so he walks back through the red door and into the room with the table, grabs the key, and walks back through the red door and then through the green door where he finds a long hallway. He heads down the long hallway and at the very end finds an orange door. He tries the orange door (its locked of course) and once again puts the key in to unlock it. 

The key once again disappears and the man assumes its back on the table in the first room so he heads down the long hallway, through the green door through the red door and finds the key on the table. He picks it up and heads back out through the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway and through the recently unlocked orange door and he finds himself in an elevator. No lock on the elevator and only one button, so the man presses the button and begins his ascent. The elevator doors open to another door, this one is yellow, and is unfortunately locked. So the man uses the key only to see it disappear once again. So the man turns around and heads down the elevator and then through the orange door and down the long hallway and through the green door and through the red door to find the key on the table. He picks it up and walks back out through the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway, through the orange door, up the elevator and through the yellow door at the end. He now finds himself in a grand circular room with eight doors! 

Much to his dismay, none are blue. But he is a dedicated and methodical man so he picks a door at random and decided to work in a circle from there. So the first door he picks is black. He goes to open it and it’s the same story, the key disappears. So he turns back to go out through the yellow door, down the elevator, out the orange door, down the long hallway through the green door through the red door and grabs the key. He takes a second to breathe before going back out the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway, through the orange door, up the elevator, through the yellow door and then checks the black door. He swings it open to reveal a brick wall. Still having hope, he moves to the next door, this one is white. He goes to unlock the door and as soon as he does, the key disappears. The man goes out through the yellow door, down the elevator, out the orange door, down the long hallway through the green door through the red door and grabs the key. Then he travels back out the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway, through the orange door, up the elevator, through the yellow door and then checks the white door. This door has another wall. Luck is really not on his side today. 

So he skips the next door, hoping for some good fortune and unlocks the gray door. I think by now the magic of the key is generally understood so of course he has to go back out through the yellow door, down the elevator, out the orange door, down the long hallway through the green door through the red door and grabs the key. Then he heads out the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway, through the orange door, up the elevator, through the yellow door and then checks the gray door. This door leads him to a twisting hallway. He travels through the hall and finds a pink door at the very end. He unlocks the pink door and immediately turns around to grab the key. Hes walking down the hallway and he thinks that he probably should check to see if that door led anywhere so he could know if he had to go back down the hall again. But, our man is lazy so he makes it to the circular room, goes out the yellow door, rides the elevator down, goes through the orange door, walks down the long hallway, walks through the green door and then through the red door to grab the key resting on the table. He takes the key through the red door, through the green door, down the long hallway, through the orange door, up the elevator, through the yellow door, into the circular room, through the grey door, down the twisting hallways and up to the pink door which he opens to find another wall. So he heads back through the twisting hallway and stands in the circular room again. He goes back to the door he skipped, its purple. He uses the key to unlock it and remembers to open the door and check. Much to his excitement, there is a blue door on the other side of the room! So he heads out through the purple door, out through the yellow door, down the elevator, out the orange door, down the long hallway, through the green door and through the red door, barely stops to grab the key and then heads back through the red door, then the green door, then down the long hallway then through the orange door then up the elevator then through the yellow door into the circular room and then through the purple door. Hes finally confronted with the blue door. He goes up to it, hand shaking in anticipation, and opens the door. At long last sees where the screaming was coming from. I really wish I could tell you, but you're not a monk.

She looked over in the corner and saw one of those weight machines that tells your fortune. So, she thought to herself, ""I'll give it a try just to see what it tells me.""

 She went over to the machine and put her nickel in and out came a card that said, ""You're a nun. You weigh 128 lbs., and you are going to Chicago, Illinois.""

 She sat back down and thought about it. She told herself it probably tells everyone the same thing, but decided to try it again. She put her nickel in, and out came a card that read, ""You're a nun. You weigh 128 lbs. You're going to Chicago, Illinois, and you are going to play a fiddle.""

 The nun said to herself, ""I know that's wrong. I have never played a musical instrument a day in my life."" She sat back down. From out of nowhere, a cowboy came over and set his fiddle case down next to her. The nun picked up the fiddle and started playing beautiful music.

 Startled, she look back at the machine and said, ""This is incredible! I've got to try it again!

 Back to the machine she went, put her nickel in, and another card came out. It said, ""You're a nun, you weigh 128 lbs., you're going to Chicago, Illinois, and you're going to break wind.""

 Now, the nun knew the machine was wrong. ""I've never broken wind in public in my whole life!"" Just then, she tripped, fell off the scales and broke wind.

 Stunned, she sat back down and looked at the machine. She said to herself, ""This is truly unbelievable! I've got to try it one more time.""

 She went back to the machine, put her nickel in and collected the card. It said, ""You're a nun, you weigh 128 lbs., you have fiddled and farted around and missed your flight to Chicago!!!""",A nun was going to Chicago.,19

On the last lap I slowed down a bit and felt something. Something bit me right in the ass. All of a sudden I flew past my opponents and came in first. It was incredible!”

The greyhound continued to eavesdrop, incredibly interested.

The other two horses were blown away. Horse two suddenly gets excited, “That’s so weird! I was in a race last month and was lagging in last place. Something bit my ass too! I ended up speeding up and coming in first place!”

The third horse was shocked; “This happened to me too, what is going on?!”

Not able to contain himself, the greyhound exclaimed, “You guys will never guess what happened to me in my last race!”

The horses went silent and all looked at each other surprised. One of the horses breaks the silence,

“Hey look you guys, a talking dog!”

A beautiful, well endowed, young blonde, goes to her local pet store in search of an exotic pet. As she looks about the store, she notices a box full of frogs. The sign says: Sex Frogs! Only $20 each! Money Back Guarantee! (Comes with complete instructions).

The girl excitedly looks around to see if anybody's watching her and whispers softly to the man behind the counter, ""I'll take one."" The man packaged the frog and said, ""Just follow the instructions carefully.""

The girl nods, grabs the box, and is quickly on her way home. As soon as she closes the door to her apartment, the girl takes out the instructions and reads them thoroughly, doing exactly what it says to do:

1. Take a shower.
2. Splash on some nice smelling perfume.
3. Slip into a very sexy teddy.
4. Crawl into bed and position the frog in place.

She then quickly gets into bed with the frog and, to her surprise, nothing happens! The girl is totally frustrated and quite upset at this point. She re-reads the instructions and notices at the bottom of the paper it says, ""If you have any problems or questions, please call the pet store."" So, the girl calls the pet store.

The man says, ""I had some complaints earlier today. I'll be right over."" Within five minutes, the man is ringing her doorbell. The girl welcomes him in and says, ""See, I've done everything according to the instructions and the damn thing just sits there.""

The man, looking very concerned, picks up the frog, stares directly into its eyes and sternly says: ""Listen to me! I'm only going to show you how to do this one more time!""",Sex frog,1588

They've known each other for a while, 15 years roughly. So they feel pretty comfortable with each other talking about more...sensitive topics. On this occasion, Fred decided to ask Michael about his son as it was something that had been nagging him for a while but he didn't want to pressure Michael into talking about him and his ex if it was too soon. But keeping the question 'bottled up' for so long had proven too great. It was something he needed to know. 

Fred: ""Michael, I'm sorry if this is a touchy area, but I've always wondered: how come your kid ended up living with your ex after the divorce?""

Michael paused, his smile fading slightly as he lowered his glass of beer and turned to Fred.

Michael: ""*sigh* Well, to put it bluntly, the court ruled that I was 'violent' and 'unstable', an unfit father.""

Fred was obviously shocked by this revelation, exclaiming, ""What?! You, violent or unstable? I've never heard such nonsense. I don't think I've ever ever met anyone as kind and even-tempered as you.""

Michael continued, saying, ""Well, Mary told this story to the court about how I came home late one night. I was tired and annoyed by my long day at work. I sensed a sneering, a mocking in Mary's tone. I don't know, I must have flipped. I grabbed the first thing at hand and since we were standing in the kitchen and I was in front of the fridge, I...I emptied a bowl of trifle over her.""

""...Ah. So she got custardy.""

For those wondering, I didn't really come up with this, not entirely at least. This is a modified version of a sketch on the British comedy show, A Bit Of Fry And Laurie. I've seen this particular joke and this sketch so many times, I decided to make my own version and post it here. ",Two friends are talking in a bar...,16
