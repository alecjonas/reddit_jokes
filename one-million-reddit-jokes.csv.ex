Father: ""Ohhh, I wish you hadn't said that. Angela is also your sister.""

This went on a few more times, and finally the son was so mad, he went straight to his mother crying.

Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch. The woman’s husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.

The little boy says, “Its dark in here.”

The man says, “Yes, it is.”

Boy ~ “I have a baseball.”

Man ~ “That’s nice.”

Boy ~ “Want to buy it?”

Man ~ “No, thanks.”

Boy ~ “My dad’s outside.”

Man ~ “OK, how much?”

Boy ~ “$250?

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.

Boy ~ “Its dark in here.”

Man ~ “Yes, it is.”

Boy ~ “I have a baseball glove.”

The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, “How much?”

Boy ~ “$750?

Man ~ “Fine.”

A few days later, the father says to the boy, “Grab your glove, let’s go outside and have a game of catch.”

The boy says, “I can’t, I sold my baseball and my glove.”

The father asks, “How much did you sell them for?”

Boy ~ “$1,000?

The father says, “That’s terrible to overcharge your friends like that…that is way more than those two things cost. I’m going to take you to church and make you confess.”

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

The boy says, “Dark in here.”

The priest says, “Don’t start that crap again.”",A woman is having an affair during the day while her husband is at work,6

I'm tall, and lethargy is my middle name. 

I guess I've always been like this. For as long as I can remember. Most kids say they wanna be an astronaut or a doctor, and here I am thinking ""Man, I just wanna do.......nothing.""

Now, let's back up a bit. Maybe try and understand where I come from. 

The year is 2006.

It was a particularly fun summer day. No school, no homework, no getting in trouble for not doing homework. It was the perfect time to spend on me, myself, my interests and my hobbies.

I was chillin on the 'puter when my mom shouted my whole name furiously. 

*""John Lethargy Quincy!!""*

I was supposed to take the trash out, and I didn't. Cuz again, I am hella lazy. I ain't proud of it, though.

I reluctantly got up from my desk chair and I decided to take the trash out. All the time I was thinking about how much I wanna be in my chair right now. 

After putting the trash out, I went back to my room to maybe boot up a game or something, but I kept getting distracted by my mom's loud ass screams from the trash can, so I took the trash back in. 

I got chewed out by mom. Hard. 

You can still see the bite marks on both my arms and left asscheek.

Anyways, after having my fill of human contact for the whole month, I went back to my room. I guess I just wanted to be  away from people for a bit. Maybe browse through some Facebook. 

Cue me scrolling through an endless feed of people saying dumb shit. Here's some off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

*""OMG GUYS MY BEST FRIEND JUST PROPOSED TO ME IM DYING""*

*""I'm a proud gun owner, and I am sticking to my guns!""*

*""OMFG HELP GUYS I PROPOSED TO DAISY AND SHE GOT HER PHONE OUT AND THEN PROCEEDED TO DIE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME""*

*""Why does the government give corn syrup a federal subsiDEEZ NUTS LMFAO""*

*""hey guys is this a good place to ask for a friend? asking for a friend""*

&amp;#x200B;

After seemingly blinded by unchecked stupidity, I stumbled upon an advice that changed my life forever.

*""you guys should check out Powerless on Channel 6, it's great. :)""*

&amp;#x200B;

I just couldn't think of anything better to do, so I decided to try the show. 

Only, it wasn't a show. It was a trip.

It was a show about a guy with no superpowers, in a world where everyone had superpowers. He roamed around looking at people doing cool shit while feeling guilty about not being able to do cool shit himself. There was also this side story arc about an animate....potato? Fun stuff. 

I got into the show, and I was amazed at how much I was able to relate to the protagonist. His journey throughout the show and how it forged him into the person he was later on.

Not long after, the series finale dropped.

And the whole thing ends with a cliffhanger. 

I've never been more pissed in my entire life. I spent so much time with this guy, I can't even get to see the end of his story?

Some people were praising the series creator for being ballsy enough to end a popular show on a cliffhanger. Some people shat on him for not giving them a satisfying ending. After a sizeable uproar, he came out and said,

""You're supposed to guide yourself to your own ending.""

According to some people, he meant that the ending of the show signified that we should carve out our own destiny, and that the protagonist is supposed to be an avatar for the viewer themselves. According to other people, he's just trying to come up with a deep-sounding explanation that actually doesn't make any sense.

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people.

A guy named Joe Smith, from Muleshoe, Texas, claimed to know everybody, and a big Texas oilman challenged him when Joe says he knows the governor of Texas. The bet is on, and the oilman flies with Joe to Austin and the governor’s office. Joe tells the secretary he would like to have a word with the governor, and in a moment the governor rushes out and embraces Joe and pats him effusively on the back, and they jaw a little and Joe proves his point.

The oilman says, 'Well, I bet you don’t know the President of the United States' and Joe claims he does, so another bet is made. They fly to Washington, and when the word is passed to the President, he comes out and Joe greets him by his first name, and the President responds, indeed, as if Joe is an old personal friend.

The oilman is frustrated and says he is sure Joe does not know the Pope, but, of course, Joe says he does indeed know the Pope, calling him by his first name. So off they fly, in the oilman’s plane, to Rome and the Vatican. When they arrive, there is a huge crowd in the square before the Pope’s palace. Joe instructs the oilman to wait there while he goes to see his old pal. Pretty soon, the Pope comes out on the balcony, waving to the crowd, and there beside him is Joe, with his arm around the Pope. Suspicious, the oilman stops a street sweeper in the crowd and asks him if the man dressed in white is really the Pope.

The cyclist asks his friend to help by allowing him to tie his bike to the back of the friend's Ferrari while the Ferrari accelerates gradually to help the cyclist increase his speed.

The cyclist and his friend get on the road one morning to begin their training.

Everything is going according to plan until at one spotlight a Lamborghini pulls up next to the Ferrari and challenges him to a race. Being a speed demon, the cyclist's friend cannot help himself and as soon as the light turns green, he begins accelerating until reaching speeds upwards 150mph! The cyclist, still tied to the Ferrari, begins to desperately ring his bell ""ring-ding-ding-ding, ring-ding-ding-ding"", but his friend cannot hear him over the loud roar of the engine.

At the next stoplight, a Bugatti pulls up next to the two cars and challenges both of them to a race. As soon as the light turns green, all three cars accelerate until reaching speeds upwards 200mph! The cyclist, exhausted but unwilling to leave his bike unattended while still tied to the Ferrari, again begins to desperately ring his bell ""ring-ding-ding-ding, ring-ding-ding-ding"", but again his friend cannot hear him.

While this is going on, a traffic cop sees everything but decides not to chase them. Instead, he returns to the station to talk to the Captain:

""Sir, effective today, I am resigning from the traffic police.""

Captain: ""But you only have 2 years left until you can retire with full benefits, why in the world would you decide to resign now?""

""How about you?"" He asks the middle-aged couple.

Discovering that the baby had seriously soiled his diaper, the boy went to his parents' room and found his mother sound asleep. He went to the maid's room, where, peeking through the keyhole, he saw his father in bed with the maid. The boy's knocking went totally unheeded by his father and the maid, so the boy returned to his room and went back to sleep. The next morning he reported to his father.

Son: ""Dad, now I think i understand what politics is.""

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.  

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.
I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).  

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.
My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.
After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.

Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.
My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.
Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.
But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.  

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.
It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.,268

When he realizes what is going on, he starts screwing both of them. He can't believe what's happening. Next morning, still surprised by last night's events, he goes downstairs to settle the bill. ""How was your room sir?"" asks the receptionist. ""Excellent, I will come back again. What do I owe you?"" asks the man. 
""Well. actually, sir, we are doing a promotional offer. Not only do you not have to pay but we give you $10 as a welcome gesture,"" says the receptionist. ""What?"" says the guy, very surprised indeed. ""That's amazing."" He takes the ten-dollar bill and wanders off, debating whether his buddies will believe him or not. Needless to say, after a few days he's told all his friends and neighbors about room 13 and the amazing night of passion. The next week one of his buddies goes to check out the room. ""Room 13 please."" ""Certainly, sir, here's your key."" After he gets in bed, at the same time, 2 o'clock, three girls this time, extremely horny, get in bed and screw his brains out. The next morning, not only does he not have to pay, but he too gets $10. After a month, everyone knows this hotel and especially room 13. Everyone that stays in room 13 gets the same treatment: a good screw and a ten bucks. 
After a few weeks, the story reaches the President. The President decides to check the story out for himself. He visits the hotel and asks for room 13. He gets the keys and goes upstairs. After a couple of drinks he gets in bed waiting patiently for the naked girls to appear. Indeed at about 2 0'clock in the morning two naked ladies come to bed. They are as horny and wild as all the stories the President has heard. The President gets his pecker out and screws the both of them all night long. This is the night of his life. Next morning he goes to reception and when he asks how much the bill is, the receptionist says, ""Nothing to pay, sir. Actually, we are doing an introductory offer. Here's $50 as a welcome gesture.""

She felt hungry one morning and went to her kitchen to make a ham and cheese toastie.

She thought this would be a good time to practise using her left hand. However things didn't go well: she cut her finger on her left hand when she tried to slice up the ham and cheese; she burnt her left hand on the toastie maker when she tried to close it; and when she tried to cut her toastie into triangles, they looked more like awkward trapeziums.

The girl, looking at her catastrophic attempt at making a toastie with her left hand, let out a long, steady sigh. Her pet parrot, who spoke fluent English but didn't understand social norms, asked her why she sighed so heavily. She replied ""my finger is bleeding, my hand is burnt, my toastie looks totally unappetizing and I forgot to get a plate for it as well"".

But she was not going to give up trying that easily.

She went to the kitchen cupboard to get one of her fancy ceramic plates. She carried on trying to use her left hand despite the state it was in. She tried her best to take the top plate from the stack without disturbing the rest, but the lack of dexterity and control in her left hand accompanied with the injuries that it had sustained from before ended up in all her expensive ceramic plates toppling out of the cupboard and smashing into pieces on the floor.

The girl, looking at the state of her kitchen, let out a long, deep sigh. Her pet parrot asked her why she sighed so heavily again. She replied ""now I have no plates to eat my toastie off of and those were very expensive plates. There's only one potter in the area that makes plates like those and his business is slowly deteriorating; he may not even make these plates any more"".

But she was not going to give up trying that easily.

The girl put on her coat and shoes and placed her pet parrot on her shoulder before walking to the potter's ""Extravagant Ceramics"" shop. She opened the door and looked around the shop. There was nobody behind the counter or in amongst the shop aisles. She tried looking in the office, but there was no one there. She tried calling out, but there was no response. She tried looking in the adjoining warehouse with the high ceiling to no avail until the parrot pecked her cheek to draw her attention and pointed his wing upwards towards the warehouse rafters.

About 30 feet above the floor, hanging from the rafters with a rope around his neck was the old potter whose failing business had unfortunately driven him to suicide.

The girl, looking at the nightmarish sight, particularly the horrific noose around the potter's neck, let out an extremely long, exasperated sigh, which lasted far longer than the previous two sighs combined.

The parrot asked her why this sigh was the longest yet.

The girl replied:

""The longest sigh of a right-handed trying girl? It's the high potter noose"".",There once was a right-handed girl who tried her best to be left-handed every now and then...,6

The girl had brought some presents for her father, which included a cool looking boxer. 
The people in the village were accustomed to wearing a lungi ( a large cloth which is wrapped around the waist ) over their boxers. The father was no different. He was so happy to get the colorful boxer which he thought he can wear under his lungi.

So he would wear his boxer and the lungi over it, and then fold his lungi till it is well over his knee so that he can flaunt his boxer. The people who saw the boxer were curious and asked, ""Wow, what a cool looking boxer, from where did you buy this?"" His usual reply was, ""My daughter is a nurse in America , and she bought it for me"" . He was proud to let others know that his daughter was a nurse in the US and also the trouser was from US.

One day, the man forgot to wear his boxer and instead just wrapped his lungi around his waist. As he went out to the town, as usual ,he folded his lungi. And this time, to show the full grandeur of his boxer which he thought he was wearing, the lungi was folded well above his upper hip.

As he reached the town, an old lady was shocked to see it and asked him, ""What nonsense is this!!?"".

He is sitting on a ledge on the roof, rubbing his face and groaning. She is standing on the roof, looking up at him. Her companion is there, a social worker also, looking at them both.

&amp;#x200B;

""*Look at this guy, you have to be here to believe this. Amber called and asked us to check on her friend here*. **Oh, um, sir, we need to ask you a few questions, okay?!**""  


""Please hold your questions until the end of the presentation. Half the factory is finished! This is the hard work of the people working on it. You did this, this is your accomplishment, this is your hard work. Any questions?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, sir, how is work?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, yeah, work is amazing! We're making humanity an interplanetary species!""

&amp;#x200B;

""A car company. Is making humanity an interplanetary species. Mmm hmm. Sir, umm ... you are staying clean and dry, are you not?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, yeah. If you don't have your health, nothing else matters.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, about that. *Assistant, over to you. He's been called out for being on red wine mixed with a rare Imidazopyridine hypnotic.* Oh, um, take this down, please come to the community center for a test, okay?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I need to ask you for the next question, please.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, okay. At work, did you not call a rival a pedo?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, um. These statements were just imaginative attacks; even if offensive, such speculative insults are by their nature opinion and protected by the first amendment. I hope that answered your question, umm, ma'am, is it?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Hoh. Are they. Next topic. In any case, my condolences for your loss, which brings me to my next question, how are you getting along with your ex-wife?""

&amp;#x200B;

The homeless man pauses. ""**I need to ask you for the next question, please**.""

&amp;#x200B;

""But sir, your legal battle was expensive and given that other than on paper you have no wealth whatsoever and your income is approximately a dollar per year, which even many homeless men exceed, you are at risk for legal expense related destitution, a risk shared by a tax evasion convict with dyslexia in the United Kingdom that did time, who was once told by his schoolteacher that he would end up in one of two places, one of which presciently was prison and the family's greatest claim to fame up to that point was wastepaper bins. Also, Wikipedia lists scotting as a negotiation technique that creates an atmosphere of power by lowering the voice. Please discontinue scotting, sir.""

&amp;#x200B;

""We're looking for questions, not essays.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir. We are looking for answers, not harsh reprimands.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry. Please keep your questions short.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, umm, let's try ... how are you getting along with your bosses? For example, you spoke highly of the firms stock, did you not?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, about that ... I already apologized for calling the stock price higher than it has any right to be. The firm has a right to succeed and a right to fail.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, do you stay awake while at work?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Do I stay awake at work...no, of course not. I'm at work 80 hours a week, no one can stay awake that long.""

&amp;#x200B;

The social worker breathes deep. ""*This is going to be a long interview*. Oh, back to your personal life, sir. How is Anne?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man collapsed a little. ""*I need to ask for the next question, please,*"" he said to no one in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, how was your meeting with the President?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I got a lot of flak from multiple fronts. I was arguing for sustainability and fairness and kindness in our immigration laws, so that they would not be unkind nor unreasonable. But if I stayed on after he pulled out of the Paris Accord, that would be saying 'this isn't important,' but it was. We could slow it down and see if there are job losses first. I hope that answered your question.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Right, well we could see that. Anyway, I want to ask you the next question.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, I need to ask for the next question, please.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, how is your other job?""

&amp;#x200B;

""How is my other job? Oh, it's going great, thanks. We just launched Arabsat-6A!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, about that. Sir, what qualifications do you have as an astronaut?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Umm, engineering and management.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, do you have other astronaut qualifications, such as military experience, or excellent physical health? As opposed to mental health?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Do I have the other qualifications? Sorry, no I do not. I need to ask for the next question.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, do you have a gambling problem?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Do I have a gambling ... umm ... we presold 20,000 flamethrowers. I hope that answered your question.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you still friends with Amber?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Am I still friends with [Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard)? Yes, of course, I like her. I just hope she comes to the theater in Reno instead of [this factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1), I would have a lot more room to enjoy her visit if it happened over there. I hope that answered it.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No further questions, sir.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks for coming, no further questions, please.""

&amp;#x200B;

The social worker and her companion smiled and left. ""These English actresses. They throw these men away and they wind up homeless. I'll let Amber know he's a wreck, but apparently he'll make it. I believe them, I think they are still friends. [Anyway, he's this homeless guy that Silicon Valley startups humor by giving him honorary titles like 'CEO'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). The real power is in the other Board positions, so he keeps the workplace revenge confined to calling this one guy a pedo. Doesn't make waves. Anyway, outside Santa Monica, one of the startups, they launch stuff out of real rockets like Falcon Heavy and then they're going to fire him and several other people into that which is further into the middle of nowhere than anywhere on Earth. And he will die there, the place is perchlorate-soaked rust with some ice. Guy has a death wish - wants to die out there. I hope this doesn't come off as too callous, but I sure hope so - there clearly is no place for him here. Anyway, looks like he's beyond our help.""

&amp;#x200B;

Her companion said, ""Is there ice? As in street slang?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ice? Oh, he did tell a joke at work that there would be coke there, but no, neither. I meant frozen water, but in aerospace, they call that ice. So it's aerospace slang ice, not street slang ice.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Like they say in the movie *Chinatown*, 'it's Chinatown, Jake'.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Futility, it is that. Anyway, making money is hard as rough con-noncon out here in Reno, so I myself may end up the next charity case. That's why I work so hard here.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well I could never work your case. I like you too much.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I wish to remain silent.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, you do that. [It's amazing, this country. Where the individual is the master of their own destiny. You have to not be a wreck to succeed here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_tack).""

&amp;#x200B;

The social worker looked down and grunted. ""**I wish to remain silent.**""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry, I ... wish ... to remain silent."" They walked off to the next case. You can build a case that anyone is a wreck. Even if you yourself are a wreck, you can still succeed, there can still be a place out there for you. You just to succeed properly, for example stay clean and dry. You can be on something and do business in your own product and wind up a millionaire, but what's worth it for you is something else. No matter how much of a wreck you are, I need to ask you to get out there and keep all of it brought.","Wreck, interrupted.",1

I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.” “I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Ed.  “How about a demonstration?” The auditor thinks for a moment and says, “Okay, go ahead.” 

Ed says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.” The auditor thinks a moment and says, “No way!  It’s a bet.” Ed removes his glass eye and bites it.  The auditor’s jaw drops. Ed says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.” The auditor can tell Ed isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. Ed removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

Ed stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the desk.

Honestly, true story I just saw on the National news.  In Daytona Beach, the waitress was trying to save a drowning 8 year old.  Instead, when she jumped off the pier, she broke her back and foot when she landed on a sand bar.

When asked by a reporter what was going through her mind, she said, ""I heard the mother screaming 'Bloody Mary' so I knew I had to save that little boy.""

No.  The sand bar was serving Bloody MURDER.",Why did the waitress jump off the pier?,0
