I found my wife naked and sweaty at the bed and I turned the place upside down looking for her lover until I heard a noise from the balcony and I saw feet dangling from my upstairs neighbor's balcony.

Finally he decided to try a new doctor who had just moved into town. After hearing the man's symptoms and listening to his belly with a stethoscope the doctor told him that he had a tapeworm. ''Oh, is that bad? How can I get rid of it?'' asked the man. ''Come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' said the doctor. When he saw a puzzled look cross the man's face, the doctor said, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.''

So, the next day the man brings in the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants, and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''What?'' says the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Whoa! Hold on a minute, Jack!'' screams the man. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

About a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the infuriated man starts to protest the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, the man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''This again?'' yells the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this!'' says the man. ''Hold still now and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with another hard boiled egg and another lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the man starts to shake his head the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, this goes on all week until one day, after the man pulls up his pants, the doctor says, ''Now come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a hammer.'' As the man turns pale the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' 

The man gets no sleep that night worried to death about what the hammer is going to feel like when it gets shoved up in him. He almost stays home, but he still feels sick. So far the treatments haven't helped and he's afraid he'll have to start over if he goes to a new doctor. The man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the hammer. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''But, why do we need a hammer?'' asks the man nervously. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

The man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Please!'' says the man, terrified of what is to come next. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, the man is about to pass out from terror and he is involuntarily clenching his rear as tight as he can. Then nothing happens. Several more minutes pass and he starts to relax. The man is about to straighten up and ask the doctor what happened when the tapeworm sticks its head out his rear and yells, ''Where's my lemon cookie?!'' And WHAM!

The professor says ""Oh, I'll do y'all better than that. I'll show y'all around these parts."" He takes then around campus, giving them a little history, and the names and purpose of each building, and is genuinely nice. They keep walking around a giant wall be doesn't ever mention. It's enormous but he says nothing. 

Finally Thibidoux can't handle it. He asks what's with the wall. The professor dismisses him and they keep walking. He asks again ""Mon, what's wit dat giant wall?"" The professor looks around and asks ""Can y'all keep a secret?"" 

Boudreaux and Thibidoux nod. The professor whispers ""Well, we're building a spaceship?"" He's so excited you can tell he is working on it and just had to tell someone. ""We are going to the sun!""

Boudreaux gives him a skeptical look. ""Aren't you gonna be juss a lille on da hot side?

The Aggie looks dead at him and says ""No, you coonasses, we're going at night""",Boudreaux and Thibidoux,0

Giotto’s father wants to know more about his son’s school performance, so he goes to the annual parent-teacher conference. He enters the Italian litterature teacher’s office and says: “H-hi, t-teacherr, I’m Gio-t-t-o’shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?”. The teacher looks at him with a disgusted face. “What’s wrong with this man? He speaks like somebody whose tongue has been cut off!”, he thinks. Still shocked, the teacher tells the man about Giotto: “I’m sorry, but Giotto is a terrible student. He knows nothing about Italian litterature and during my lessons, I always see him drawing on his desk, paying no attention to me”. Hearing these words, Giotto’s father goes mad and starts uttering: “W-what? T-thish i-issh sshameful! T-tonight I’mm g-gonna t-teach him w-what the word d-dishhipline r-really meanssh!”
So he leaves the room and goes to the math teacher’s office. 
“H-hi, t-teacherr, I’m Gio-t-t-o’shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?, he asks.
The math teacher doesn’t believe his eyes. “How could this man end up speaking like this? I can hardly understand what he says as he keeps spitting all around the office!”, he thinks. Then he answers the man’s question: “Giotto is a disaster, sir. He can barely count to 10 and whenever I look at him, I find him drawing on his desk”. Giotto’s father goes mad again and leaves the office. “T-tonight I’m t-teaching him a l-lesshhon!”, he shouts.
Finally, Giotto’s father reaches the art teacher’s office.
“H-hi, t-teacherr, I’m Gio-t-t-o’shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?”.
The art teacher is shoked at first. “What happened to this man?”, he thinks. Then he smiles: “You’re a very lucky father, sir! Your son is a genius! He draws like no other. I’m sure he has a bright future ahead of him. Yesterday, for example, he painted a window on my classroom’s wall. Outside the window you could see an amazing landscape wih hills, flowers, birds and even a river! It was so realistic that I tried to look out the window and I hit my head against the wall!”, says the art teacher while pointing at a large patch on his forehead.
Giotto’s father seems to be unimpressed: “W-Well”, he says, “t-that sshhhhon of a b-bitch! It wasshh worshhe f-for me! Two d-days ago he p-painted a pusshhy on the shhtove!”

Joe then says that Ann sang the National Anthem while simultaneously sucking him off. 

Phil, who is completely shocked by this discovery, asks for Joe's approval to try to hook up with Ann. Joe gives his approval.

So the next day, Phil asks Ann out and she says how she's hoped that Phil would ask her out for some time now. That night, after their date, Phil and Ann go back to his place and head straight to the bedroom (I feel that I should mention that Ann is a bit easy, if you know what I mean).

Anyways, they start making out and then Ann starts to go down on Phil. She asks Phil to turn the light off to set the mood. He of course reaches over and flips the lights off. Ann then starts sucking his dick and Phil is loving it. Shortly after, Ann begins to sing the National Anthem with such a beautiful voice. Phil is practically in tears by the amazing blowjob and the beauty of her voice. Phil slowly reaches for the light switch because he really wants to know how she's doing both things simultaneously. He finally reaches the light switch.

Intrigued he decides to go check out the mine, and finds the walls absolutely glittering with silver. He rushes back to town and buys the mine, and then goes to the local hardware store to buy a pickax and a wheelbarrow. He then spends the next week going up to the mine every day, filling his wheelbarrow with silver, dumping the precious loot in his truck and driving back to town to sell the silver to the bank. After a week of hard work he has more money than he knows what to do with, so he decides he can afford to take on a little help. He puts out a help wanted ad for a day laborer, and soon enough he gets a call from an American Indian. The Indian says ""ad says you need worker. am strong worker, will work very hard."" and the man hires him on.

  For the next week the two of them work in the mine, the Indian picking away at the walls, and the young man dumping the wheel barrow in the truck and driving back into town to sell the silver. Another week's worth of money in the bank, the young man is feeling great. He gets a call from a Mexican answering his help wanted ad. He decides that he and the Indian have been working hard, and there's money to spare, why not take the Mexican on. He shows the Mexican around the mine and tells him that the Indian will work at the walls with the pickax, and that the Mexican will be dumping the full wheelbarrow in the truck for the young man to drive back into town to sell the silver. ""Es no problema, senor, si I dump the silver.""

  And so they went, the Indian picking the silver out of the walls of the mine, the Mexican wheeling the silver out of the mine and dumping it in the truck, and the young man driving back to town and selling the silver to the bank. Yet another week goes by and the team in the mine are going gangbusters. They're making money hand over fist and the young man is ecstatic. Then he gets a call from a Chinese man saying ""I see ad fo' worker. I rike work vely much. you pay me!""
  
 The man thinks it over, he really didn't think they needed more help, the Indian was doing great working the wall, the Mexican was running the wheelbarrow as fast as he could the second it was filled, and the man only had one truck to drive back into town. But, after a minute he told the Chinese man ""OK, I'll take you on. You can be in charge of the supplies. Whatever the Indian or the Mexican need, you get all the supplies, OK?"" ""OK,"" said the Chinese man, ""supplies, I do supplies.""
 
 The next day the young man drove back into town to sell their most recent haul of silver, and when he came back he saw the Indian and the Mexican hard at work, but he couldn't find the Chinese man. He asked the Indian if he had seen him ""No,"" said the Indian ""I work wall. I do not see Chinese man today"". He asks the Mexican, and ""No senor. I no see no Chinese senor"". Confused the young man walks deeper and deeper into the mine looking for his most recent hire. It's getting darker the further into the mine he goes, and as he walks around a corner the Chinese man leaps out in front of him yelling **""SUPPLIES!!""**

After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified -- an American, a Russian, an Australian and an Indian. 

He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.

The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table the interviewer asked, 

""What is the fastest thing you know?"" 

Dave, the American, replied,""A THOUGHT”. It just pops into your head. There's no warning that it's on the way; it's just there. A thought is the fastest thing I know of.""

""That's very good!"" replied the interviewer. 

""And now you sir?"" he asked Vladimir , the Russian.

""Hmm... let me see. A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know.

""Excellent!"" said the interviewer. ""The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliché for speed”. 

He then turned to George, the Austral ian who was contemplating his reply.

""Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light in the barn comes on Yep, Turning on a LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of.""

The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. ""It's hard to beat the speed of light"" he said.

Turning to the Guy from India , the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question. 

He replied, (in his Indian accent!) ""Apter herring da 3 prebius ansers sir, et's obius to me dat the fastest thing is DIARRHEA.""

""WHAT!?"" said the interviewer, stunned by the response. The others were already giggling in their seats...

""Oh, I can expleyn sir,"" said the Indian. 

“You see, sir, da ader day my tummy was pheeling bad and so I run so fast to the baatrum,, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I alredi done it !

""Yes"", she sighed, 
""He's my old boyfriend. I understand he took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear he hasn't been sober since."" 
""My God!"" I said, ""Who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?"" 
And then the fight started... 
________________________________ 

When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed. But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat, making beer.. Always something more important to me. Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. 
When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again I handed her a toothbrush. I said, ""When you finish cutting the grass, you might as well sweep the driveway."" 
The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp. 
______________________________ 

My wife sat down next to me as I was flipping channels. 
She asked, ""What's on TV?"" 
I said, ""Dust."" 
And then the fight started... 
________________________________ 

My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. 
She said, ""I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 165 in about 2 seconds."" 
I bought her a bathroom scale. 
And then the fight started...... 
______________________________ 

After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security. 
The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's License to verify my age. 
I looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later. 
The woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'. 
So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. 
She said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application. 
When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office. She said, 'You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten disability too.' 
And then the fight started... 
________________________________ 

My wife was standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror. 
She was not happy with what she saw and said to me, 
""I feel horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to pay me a compliment.' 
I replied, ""Your eyesight's damn near perfect."" 
And then the fight started........ 
________________________________ 

I rear-ended a car this morning...the start of a REALLY bad day! 
The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!! 
He looked up at me and said 'I am NOT Happy!' 
So I said, 'Well, which one ARE you then?' 
That's how the fight started. 
",And that's how the fight started,361

I had the innovational idea to create a new insulting-word.

Word: Trump
Meaning: some1 is a trump when he is low-minded, stupid, dumb 
How to use the word:
- ""You are very trump!""
- ""Haha! you are the trumpest person i know.""
- ""Dude wtf? Do you think im Trump or whaaat?""
- ""Roses are red you are trump""

Background: There is some1 whos name begins with a D...
Like Duck (dude dont be so dirty-minded, i know what you thought here). And this Duck is very stupid. I mean seriously veeeery stupid. So why call some1 ""stupid"" when you can call him TRUMP!
- The new innovative word!

Caution: not to use when being honestly low-minded.


So lets throw this new meaning of ""TRUMP"" to the entire internet.

He called the royal weather forecaster and inquired as to the weather forecast for the next few hours. The weatherman assured him that there was no chance of rain in the coming days. So the king went fishing with his wife, the queen. 

 On the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area"". 

 The king was polite and considerate, he replied: ""I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional. Besides, I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" 

 So he continued on his way. However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked...... and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition. Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the weatherman at once! Then he summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster. 

 The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain."" 

 So the king hired the donkey. And so began the practice of hiring asses to work in the government, and ...occupy its highest and most influential positions..... and which later became the symbol for the Democrat party.

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank’s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?” The blond replies…..“Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?”",Who doesn't like a blonde joke?,6

In a fit of rage I used poor language and called him a fag.  We got into a fight and I knocked him out.  Nobody saw him initially start the fight, they just saw me hurl an offensive insult and attack him.

Well it turns out that he was actually gay and they are now trying to charge me with a hate crime even though I didn't mean it as a homophobic slur.  I was considering calling him a retard, but wasn't quite sure if he was Polish or not and didn't want to offend him...he did not appear homosexual so I did not think it would offend.

My lawyer has advised me to claim I am homosexual in order to get this charge dropped...but he is telling me that simply claiming to be homosexual will not be enough.  This is all just so messed up because I have nothing against gay people and the person accusing me is the one that actually started the fight!

He wants me to stand in front of 12 jurors and receive anal sex from him.  I asked him if I could just perform oral on him but he told me that I cant because legally speaking he is a top.  

I asked my lawyer how long this will last for, and he is telling me the longer the better.  He is saying it will be best if he reaches ejaculation, but is not quite sure if they will allow him to bring in anal beads and butt plugs as a witness....if he isn't allowed to bring them in he says our chances will only be 50/50.

He says that if we do lose that we will be able to have a retrial once I am in prison for awhile.  I asked why anything would be different then and why we couldn't just prove my innocence now...he stated that the main issue currently with the case is that I am not his type.  He said I was not adequately fit to stand the trial.....I said ""what?!  Then why are we going to trial!"" He apologized and meant that he was talking about my fitness and excess weight.  I broke into tears and he comforted me with a gentle kiss on the neck then explained to me that in prison I will surely obtain evidence within weeks of being there.  He explained that I would be going to a maximum security prison and that my chances of being raped were pretty high.  

The more I talk to him the more he seems disinterested....I think he is becoming less and less attracted to me.  He has already started giving me advice on how to get raped the fastest in prison.  He is telling me not to resist so it makes it look like it is consensual and to not shower afterwards...he is explaining that I may need to hold the ejaculate within my asshole for weeks until it can be processed in a lab.  He is telling me that once it happens it will be one of the greatest days of my life.

post,3rgq36,2qh72,jokes,false,1446620130,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3rgq36/woman_who_loves_a_fish/,self.jokes,,"Once-upon-a-time, there was a young woman who fell in love with a fish. This caused her parents some embarrassment when they went to church. When her father had found out he screamed ""What do you mean she's dating a fish!"".

""He's not an ordinary fish dear, he's one of those anthropomorphic fish, the kind that talk and take on human characteristics""

""Does he have a job?""

""Well no, but he reads a lot, and he's very polite. He's really a very nice boy dear.""

""He's an unemployed fish!""

""Whatever.""

Eventually the young woman began to grow unsatisfied with the lack of sex in the relationship. She was also getting tired of him staying home all day and reading while she worked all day. The young woman decided to go to the witch who lived in the forest, and ask her to turn her fish into a man. So she took the fish to the witch.

""Well let's see here."" the witch said, looking at the fish ""Very nice fish you got here, nice coloring. I'll take it, now what do you want?"" she asked the young woman.

""This fish and I have fallen in love and I want you to turn him into a man."" the young woman replied.

""Is this true?"" the witch asked the fish.

""Yes ma'am"" smiled the fish.

""Did I do this?"" the witch asked the young woman.

""No, he was always a fish""

""No, what I mean is did I make you fall in love with the fish? I have a few drinks now and then, and the next thing you know whole weeks are blacked out."" the witch said.

""I don't think so."" the young woman said.

""O.k., so if I turn this fish into a man, you go home with a man, and I get to keep the fish?""

""If you turn the fish into a man, then there won't be a fish for you to keep, unless I'm missing something here."" said the young woman with a quizzical look on her face.

""So we need to arrange another method of payment then?"" asked the witch.

""I think so.""

""Well o.k., did you bring any money dear?""

""I'm afraid I'm just a poor farm girl with no material possessions.""

""I'll change the fish into a man after you have worked for me for a year.""

The young woman agreed and went to work for the witch, sweeping, cooking, and sewing for the witch. Finally the year passed, and the witch turned the fish into a tall and handsome man. And so the young woman and the tall and handsome former fish lived happily until the tall and handsome former fish left the young woman for a barmaid with long legs and a learning disability.

Eventually the young woman found a young man who was slightly younger than her, but extremely gifted at oral sex and they settled down.

She often thought about the tall and handsome former fish and how stupid she was. She was thinking these every thoughts one day while she was fishing off the bridge. She felt something bite the hook, and she yanked the poll up. To her surprise, the fish called out to her ""Hey Baby!""

""Not another one!"" she screamed.

""It's me baby. Don't you remember? We really had something special!"" said the fish.

""What happened to that barmaid you left me for?"" the young woman scowled.

""She left me, and when I wouldn't leave her alone, she got the witch to turn me back into fish."" said the fish.

""Well come on dear let's take you to the witch and straighten this out."" she said the fish. And so she took the fish to witch.

""Hello."" said the witch as she answered the door.

""Do you remember me? I worked for you for a year so that you would turn this fish into a man. It seems another woman had you turn him back into a fish."" the young woman said to the witch.

""Oh yes I remember, lovely fish."" the witch said.

""Well I'd like to make another deal with you.""

""What would you like dear?""

""I'd like to you make my breasts bigger, and in exchange you can have the fish."" the woman said to the witch.

""Baby! You can't do this to me, not after all we've meant to each other!""

""Deal."" said the witch.

And so the young woman went home that evening without any fish, but her husband didn't seem to notice.

A bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely *not* Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with lorries, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.

An Ornithological Behaviourist was sought to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

The Ornithological Behaviourist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

The scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say ""Cah"", none could say ""Lorry.""",A warning to all truck drivers and bird lovers,11

So I'll tell you what: let's have a race. Three times around the barn and three times around the house. Whoever wins gets to be head rooster.""

I've got this, thought the young rooster. ""BUT,"" said the old hag, ""I'm an old bird, and I need a head start, so I get to start 20 seconds ahead of you."" The young rooster reluctantly agreed, and the race soon began. Around and around they went, and the old rooster became nervous as the young rooster was catching up quick. On the second time around the house, out came the farmer with a gun. Only a moment later, he pointed quickly at the young rooster and shot him dead. ""What happened?"" his wife asked, as she ran out to the farmer.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him: ""We're not coming out until you leave!""

The old man frowned, ""I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.""

Holding the bucket up he said, ""I'm here to feed the alligators!""

A Game Warden is walking along a beach one morning when he spots a man with a bucket of lobsters. The Warden walks up to the man, flashes his badge and says, ""You're in big trouble, buddy. Poaching lobsters is a serious offense."" 

The man answers, ""You've got it all wrong, these lobsters are my pets! Every morning I take them out for some exercise. I let them swim around in the ocean for a few minutes and then whistle them back in.""

The Warden looks at the man skeptically and says, ""Okay then, prove it.""

The man proceeds to throw the lobsters into the ocean and both he and the Warden stand there waiting. After a couple minutes the Warden looks at the man and says, ""That's long enough, now whistle your lobsters back in."" The man turns to the Warden and says ""Lobsters? What lobsters?""

 ""Dad,"" he says, ""You won't believe what modern education is developing! They actually have a program here at Hendrix that will teach our dog, Ole' Blue how to talk!"" 

 ""That's amazing,"" his Dad says. ""How do I get Ole' Blue in that program?"" 

 ""Just send him over here with $1,000"" the young Arkie says ""and I'll get him in the course."" 

 So, his Father sends the dog and $1,000. 

 About two-thirds of the way through the semester, the money again runs out. The boy calls home. 

 ""So how's Ole' Blue doing son?"" his Father asks. 

 ""Awesome, Dad, he's talking up a storm,"" he says, ""but you just won't believe this -- they've had such good results they have started to teach the animals how to read!"" 

 ""Read!?"" says his Father, ""No kidding! How do we get Blue in that program?"" 

 ""Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class."" 

 The money promptly arrives. The Arkie and his girlfriend are able to buy enough marijuana to last the whole semester. But our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his Father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. Even though he was always pretty much able to lie his way out of trouble, the Arkie asked his girlfriend to help him think of a really good lie to tell his Dad. 

 She very quickly came up with a plan for him. She has him shoot the dog. 

 When he arrives home at the end of the year, his Father is all excited. 

 ""Where's Ole' Blue? I just can't wait to see him read something and talk!"" 

 ""Dad,"" the boy says, ""I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Ole' Blue was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading the Wall Street Journal, like he usually does"". 

 ""Then Ole' Blue turned to me and asked, so, is your Daddy still messing around with that little redhead who lives down the street?""

The four Goldberg brothers, Lowell, Norman, Hiram, and Maxwell, invented and developed the first automobile air-conditioner. On July 17, 1946 , the temperature in Detroit was 97 degrees. 

 The four brothers walked into old man Henry Ford's office and sweet-talked his secretary into telling him that four gentlemen were there with the most exciting innovation in the auto industry since the electric starter. 

 Henry was curious and invited them into his office. 

 They refused and instead asked that he come out to the parking lot to their car. 

 They persuaded him to get into the car, which was about 130 degrees inside, turned on the air conditioner, and cooled the car off immediately. 

 The old man got very excited and invited them back to the office, where he offered them $3 million for the patent. 

 The brothers refused, saying they would settle for $2 million, but they wanted the recognition by having a label, 'The Goldberg Air-Conditioner,' on the dashboard of each car in which it was installed. 

 Now old man Ford was more than just a little anti-Jewish, and there was no way he was going to put the Goldberg's name on two million Fords. 

 They haggled back and forth for about two hours and finally agreed on $4 million and that just their first names would be shown. 

 So to this day, all Ford air conditioners show -- 


 Lo, Norm, Hi, and Max -- on the controls.

Feeling better, the man asks the missionary for directions to the nearest town. 
On his way out the backdoor, he sees this horse. He goes back into the house and asks the missionary, ""Could I borrow your horse and give it back when I reach the town?"" 
The missionary says, ""Sure but there is a special thing about this horse. You have to say 'Thank God' to make it go and 'Amen' to make it stop."" 
Not paying much attention, the man says, ""Sure, ok."" 
So, he gets on the horse and says, ""Thank God"" and the horse starts walking. Then he says, ""Thank God, Thank God, "" and the horse starts trotting. 
Feeling really brave, the man says, ""Thank God, Thank God, Thank God, Thank God, Thank God"" and the horse just literally takes off.

They must be    saved. I'll  give 50,000 Euros to the fire department that brings them out  intact."" But the roaring flames held the fire-fighters off. Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation  became desperate.  As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out  that the offer was now 100,000 Euros to the fire department who could  save the company's secret files. From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came  into sight. It was the nearby rural township volunteer Fire Company  composed mainly of men over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement,  the little broken-down fire engine roared right past all the sleek  newer engines that were parked outside the plant.  Without even  slowing down, it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched in amazement and disbelief as the  old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it  back on all sides.  It was a performance and effort never seen before. Within a short time, the old timers had extinguished the fire and  saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a  superhuman feat he was upping the reward to 200,000 Euros, and walked  over to thank each of the brave fire fighters personally. The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film,  asking their chief,"" What are you going to do with all that money? ""Well,"" said Paddy Murphy, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da foist ting we're gonna do is fix da brakes on dat fecking truck !""",Firefighters,182

“What’s the matter dear?” she whispers as she steps into the room. “Why are you down here at this time of night!?”

    
The husband looks up from his drink, “It’s the 20th anniversary of the day we met.”

She can’t believe he has remembered. She starts to tear up.

The husband continues solemnly, “Do you remember 20 years ago when we started dating? I was 18 and you were only 15.”

Once again, the wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring and sensitive.

“Yes, I do,” she replies.

The husband pauses… the words were not coming easily.

“Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car?”

“Yes, I remember,” said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.

The husband continued.

“Do  you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, ‘Either  you marry my daughter or I will make sure you spend the next 20 years in  prison?'”

“I remember that too,” she replied softly…

Guess what, its lunch hour and every food shop in the city appears to have a long queues. Looking around saw a restaurant neon flashing in mid daylight. Though, that'll do. 
Went in, and it was packed, except there was a chair empty at a table on the other end of the busy restaurant hall. On the other chair on that table, behold, its my boss, yelling at the waiter. My boss always yells, doesn't matter who, there is always a reason for him.
I made my way there and asked as politely as possible if I may join him. He looked upset, more than the usual, looked at me with a red face throbbing in anger, didn't say anything. Well, he did not say no, I took my chance and sat down. The waiter came and I asked him what he can bring me now, without waiting. He replied 'the special soup'. So be it, soup it is.
I noticed that boss had not touched his soup, the same one I ordered and it is just sitting there. Looked at my watch and 6 minutes had already passed. Asked him if he was going to have that soup, I ordered the same and he could have mine which would arrive hot. Thought to my self the he must be aware of the meeting I'm presenting in.
Well, here goes, I pulled bowl towards me again with as much politeness as I could manage. Amazingly my bosses expression remained absolutely unchanged. I started gobbling down the soup like there is no tomorrow. And as I reached the bottom of the bowl I could notice something there. Heck what ever, I kept at it and finally when I finished it all I could see that the object at the bottom of the bowl was a dead cockroach. Dear goodness, my stomach churned and almost in a single reflex all of what I just swallowed I puked back out onto the bowl drop for drop.

As I was reeling from it and began to process the information of what just happened, my boss spoke. ""That's right, I did exactly the same!""",Lunch Hour,4

Two wrestlers an American and a Russian were the finialists in the World Championship event.

They were preparing to meet each other in the final round and the American coach was giving instructions to his star wrestler.
The coach was saying, ""Beware of the Russian and his famous hold - the pretzel. No one has ever got out of that hold!.""
The match begins and the Russian finally gets an advantage on the American and he is in the dreaded pretzel hold.
The spectators start to get up to leave.
Suddenly there is a blood curdling scream and the Russian goes flying across the canvas, and the American wrestler feebly crawls over and pins him for the title.

Later the American coach asked, ""How did you get out of that hold?""
The wrestler responds, ""Well I knew I was dead meat when he got me in that hold. I opened my eyes and through the blur I could see these big pink testicles.

So I stretched my neck with all my might and I bit down on those babies just as hard as I could.

He decides to go on and take a look around. After walking through the camping and fishing sections he ends up in the hunting supply section. He notices the trophy heads mounted on the wall and is drawn to the moose. Despite having never gone further then the subway map his entire life he decides he is going to go moose hunting. 

He finds a Grizzly Adams looking employee at the store and tells the man ""I want everything I need to go moose hunting.""

After some questions Grizzly Adams realised this new hunter has lots of money but zero outdoor experience. He sells city boy 5 full outfits of hunting clothes, a high end tent and sleeping bag, camp stove and cooking gear and all the odds and ends needed for a week long stay in the woods. They make their way over to the firearm section and Grizzly sells the man the most expensive rifle they sell. 

Looking over his haul city boy asks ""so now that I have all this gear am I guaranteed I'll get a moose?""

Grizzly looks around to make sure no one was listening in and leaned in close to city boy. He quietly tells him he can guarantee the man gets a moose if he can keep quiet about a family hunting secret of his. City boy eagerly agrees and Grizzly takes him to the back room of the store. Grizzly produced a wooden box the size of a shoe box and puts it on the table in the centre of the room. City boy opens the box and the smell that came from the box nearly knocked him flat on his back. He looks at grizzly through his watering eyes and asks what the rancid stink has to do with moose hunting. 

Grizzly explains ""this box holds your secret weapon to guarantee you land a moose, the vagina from a female moose. Just put this on a string around your neck and you'll have a bull moose coming your way in no time.""

Satisfied with his haul, moose box and all, city boy pays for his gear and heads off to the wilderness to kill a majestic moose. 

About 2 weeks later Grizzly notices that same city boy walking in his store. City boy looks like he's been in a fight he has a black eye, his arm in a sling and cuts and scrapes on every bit of exposed skin he can see. As soon as city boy sees Grizzly stomps right over to him points in his face and yells ""you son of a bitch I'm going to sue you and take everything you have!""

Confused, Grizzly asks the man what's the problem. City boy gets right in his face and yells ""you never sold me any bullets for that gun. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN FUCKED BY A MOOSE!?!?""",Urbanite tries moose hunting,0

Gentlemen,
I have been riding your trains daily for the last two years, and the service on your line seems to be getting worse every day. I am tired of standing in the aisle all the time on a 14-mile trip. I think the transportation system is worse than that enjoyed by people 2,000 years ago.

Yours truly,
Patrick Finnegan
--------------------------------
Dear Mr. Finnegan,
We received your letter with reference to the shortcomings of our service and believe you are somewhat confused in your history. The only mode of transportation 2,000 years ago was by foot.

Sincerely,
Irish Railway Company
-----------------------------------
Gentlemen,
I am in receipt of your letter, and I think you are the ones who are confused in your history. If you will refer to the Bible and the Book of David, 9th Chapter, you will find that Balaam rode to town on his ass.
That, Gentlemen, is something I have not been able to do on your train in the last two years!

Yours truly,
Patrick Finnegan.",The Irish Railway Company,147
