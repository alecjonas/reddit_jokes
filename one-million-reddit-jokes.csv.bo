: ‘What’s this?’

‘A cock,’ she answered.

Deeply dejected, he concluded that she, too, failed to meet his requirements.

Two weeks later, he met another sweet girl and invited her home. He whipped out his manhood and asked her: ‘What’s this?’

She giggled and said: ‘A pee-pee.’

That was exactly the sort of innocent answer he was looking for, and the pair began dating. Soon they married and settled down to enjoy their life together. But whenever she saw him naked, she giggled and said: ‘That’s your pee-pee.’ Whilst he found it endearing at first, it eventually began to grate a little, so he thought he ought to correct her.

‘Look,’ he explained, ‘this is not a pee-pee, it’s a cock.’

She laughed and said: ‘No, it’s not. A cock is ten inches long and black.’","Frustrated by a world of moral decay, a man decided that he wanted a pure, innocent woman for his wife.",182

Few days before the fight he prepares his favorite snacks and beer, he checks the TV to make sure everything is in order and he has the right channel.

With moments before the fight his snacks are all set up within the hands reach from his chair in front of the TV.

One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, and the breeze was warm and gentle. It was a perfect night for love. In such a romantic atmosphere, that pig gradually started looking better and better, and soon the guy rolled towards the pig and put his arm around it. The dog was not happy with this and growled fiercely at the guy until he removed his arm from the pig.

Over the ensuing weeks, the trio continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no further cuddling. Then there was another shipwreck, and this time the sole survivor was a beautiful young woman. Slowly they nursed her back to health and she was eventually introduced to their evening beach ritual.

It was another beautiful evening, red sky, cirrus clouds, warm gentle breeze, perfect for romance, the four of them lying there.

A man is walking home alone late one foggy Halloween night, when behind him he hears: 
BUMP... BUMP... BUMP... 
Walking faster, he looks back and through the fog he makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street toward him. 

BUMP... BUMP... BUMP... 

Terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him. 
FASTER... FASTER... BUMP... BUMP... BUMP.... 
He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him. However, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping. 

clappity-BUMP...clappity-BUMP... clappity-BUMP...

on his heels, as the terrified man runs. 

Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, he locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps. 

With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door. 
Bumping and clapping toward him. 
The man screams and reaches for something, anything...

All he can find is a box of cough drops! Desperate, he throws the cough drops at the coffin ...

One day as hes leaving a little dark pub in the backstreets of Dublin City, he hears a voice, HEY!

He looks around for the source but see's no one, then he hears it again, HEY YOU DOWN THERE!, so he looks up at a large block of residential housing and notices a man hanging out of one of the top floor windows waving.

HEY YOU, YOU THE GUY LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT PINT OF GUINNESS!!

He's a little confused as to how he knew but he shouts back, YES, THAT'S ME ALRIGHT!

The man shouts down, COME TO TOP FLOOR AND YOU'LL GET ONE.

The guy is a little confused and slightly nervous of the request but as he's been searching for years for the perfect pint he feels he has to check it out. So into the building he goes, gets in the elevator and presses the button for the top floor.

The elevator doors open and to his surprise there in front of him is the cosiest looking pubs he's ever seen, complete with the collie dog beside an open fire.

Still somewhat confused by all this he goes up to the bar, can I have a pint of Guinness please? He asks.

Of course! said the bartender and begins to pour him a pint. When the bartender sets the pint in front of him his eyes light up as it been poured in the perfect manner, however it's not the first time hes had a perfect LOOKING pint so although really pleased he has still got some doubts.

The man holds the glass upto his lips and takes a drink of his pint, instantly tears form in his eyes and the man starts crying, Are you O.K asked the bartender? YES! shouts the man, I'VE FINALLY FOUND IT!!, ITS A PEFECT PINT. He can't stop smiling as he downs the pint and quickly orders another.

Just then the fire escape door in the back corner of the pub flies open and a man in a sharp grey suit with thick black rimmed glasses walks in and sits beside the guy.

Hey it's you, said the man in glasses.

Confused the Man asks, Do I know you?

Yeah, said the guy in glasses, I'm the guy that shouted at you to come up, I hear EVERYTHING around here and I heard you were looking for a perfect pint of Guinness so I thought I'd let you know of this place as no one really knows its here, although that's not a bad thing he says with a smile.

Why's that asked the man  surely the more drink they sell the better, why keep the place a secret asks the Man.

The guy in glasses leans over and whispers, The Guinness in this place is literally MAGIC, if you drink two pints really fast it gives you the ability to float around weightless.

Hahaha, shut the hell up, I though you wred being serious for a minute there, says the Man.

The guy in glasses is staring at him with dead eyes, clearly not impressed by his put down, he says, Oh you think I'm joking, then watch this. He orders two pints from the bartender and downs them both in a few seconds, walks to the fire escape door and leaps out of it.

Now the man is wondering what the hell is going on so he goes over to the fire escape door and opens it, HOLY FUCK, he cries. There are no fire stairs or ladder or rope, just a slight drop to the ground, 14 floors below, and there just floating around in mid air was the guy in glasses, SEE!!, glasses guy shouts, not laughing now are you as he floats back towards the building and gently set his feet back on the ground, I told you but you didn't believe me did you?

The Man is absolutley stunned by what he just witnessed and asks the guy in glasses, so how does it work?

I dont know, says the glasses guy, I ordered 2 pints 1 day and drank them really fast as the wife doesnt like me coming here after work and timed me on the way home to make sure I'm not stopping, so I drank them really fast and just as I was leaving someone said the wife was coming up the stairs so I ran out the fire escape not knowing they had removed the stairs the day before, and nstead of falling I just floated, that's how I found out.

Amazed by the event and then again by glasses guys story the man decides to give it a go and orders two pints at the bar, drinks them as fast as he can and then proceeds to walk over to the fire escape, the guy in glasses al the while chanting, do it, do it, do it, the man stands there for a few seconds and steps out......

He instantly drops like a stone and hits the ground below with a deafening splat.

WOW, DID YOU SEE THAT! Shouts the man in glasses to the bartender, he actually did it, the dumb fuck did it.

The bartender is looking over, not impressed by the event and says, you know what you are a real asshole when your drunk Superman.",The Perfect Pint.,0

In honour of the Harvest Festival, you will be executed in three days. But, before I kill you, I will grant you three requests. What is your first request?”

The Lone Ranger responds, “I’d like to speak to my horse.”

The Chief nods and Silver is brought before the Lone Ranger, who whispers in Silver’s ear, and the horse gallops away.

Later that evening, Silver returns with a beautiful,naked blonde woman on his back. As the Indian Chief watches, the blonde enters the Lone Ranger’s Tent and spends the night.

The next morning the Indian Chief admits he’s impressed. “You have very fine and loyal horse, but I will still kill you in two days. What is your second request?”

The Lone Ranger again asks to speak to his horse. Silver is brought to him, and he again whispers in the horse’s ear.

As before, Silver takes off across the plains and disappears over the horizon. Later that evening, to the Chief’s surprise, Silver again returns, this time with a naked brunette, even more attractive than the blonde.
She enters the Lone Ranger’s tent and spends the night. 

The following morning the Indian Chief is again impressed. “You are indeed a man of many talents, but I still kill you tomorrow.

“What is your last request?”
The Lone Ranger responds,” I’d like to speak to my horse….ALONE.”

The Chief is curious, but he agrees, and Silver is brought to the Lone Ranger’s tent.

Once they’re alone, the Lone Ranger grabs Silver by both ears, looks him square in the eye and says:
“Listen very carefully, you fcuking dickhead, for the last time………. . BRING POSSE!!!!”",The Lone Ranger was ambushed and captured by an enemy Indian war party.,3445

He had been exploring and looking for a hidden treasure. The golden cask of a mystic pharaoh. 

He bough a compass, a map, dynamite and a decommissioned nazi tank from some shady merchants that assured him that they knew the location of the treasure. 

And thus, his journey began. 

He didn’t know that the compass was faulty, his map was off by a couple kilometers, the dynamite was expired and the tank got stuck in the deep sand. 

He was hopeless, dehydrated and in a lot of trouble. 

After a couple of days, he thought his time to meet his maker had come. 

As he was coming in and out of consciousness, he felt water touch his lips. An old sheepherder came to his rescue.  

The old shepherd saw him from really far away, and he stopped tending his duties and came to his aid. He gave him water and food. He bandaged his sun burnt shoulders and waited for him to regain his strength. 

The old mad had seen others try to find the hidden treasure. People like the American, that had been defrauded by ruffians. This was not the first time he helped someone in need. 

Once the American regained his consciousness, they began to chat. 

“I understand the compass, to guide your journey. The map to help you find your way, the dynamite to open the tomb... but why use such a heavy vehicle? You could have travelled by camel or by foot. You risked your life by traveling through this vast desert with such heavy machinery”

After much pondering, with tears in his eyes, the treasure hunter said:

I worked as a reporter very briefly, and we had an older fella that would always tell us one joke a day. He was a great guy and I just wanted to pass on one of his jokes that always stood out to me, so here it is.

If you were to ask who the fastest superhero is, there are a few that come to mind. Realistically, The Flash, fastest man alive, is your guy.

Well, superheroes are like us, they get stressed and overworked too. So, they all have different ways of unwinding and decompressing.

Well, Flash decides to go to the beach, but this isn’t just any beach, this is a nude beach.

As he is walking around, he sees some friends from his universe and others as well. Hawk Girl playing volleyball, cheating of course because she can fly, her big ol’ tits smacking around. He sees The Hulk walking, footprints behind him with a thick line in the sand between them.

Trying to divert his gaze, he looks down toward the end of the beach and sees the most stunning creature ever, Wonder Woman. She is just laying there, sunglasses on, ignoring everything, just sprawled out.

“Man, what I wouldn’t do to have sex with a woman like that...” Flash says to himself. After a moment of humoring the thought, he thinks, “I mean, I am the fastest man alive... I could go over there, do whatever I want, then leave before anyone knew anything...”

Hyping himself up before he could second guess himself, Flash darts over to Wonder Woman, does his business and then leaves in a flash chuckling to himself. “I just had sex with Wonder Woman!”

In the burst of air that passes as he disappears, Wonder Woman props herself up on her elbows, takes her sunglasses off, and fixes her hair as she looks around. Confused, she asks, “What in the world was that?”

Meanwhile, the Invisible Man on top of her replies, “I don’t know, but my ass sure hurts.”",Superhero Nude Beach,36

""And what do you deduce from that?"" asks Holmes.

Watson ponders for a minute.

""Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful, and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?""

So he decided to go to a sex toy shop to get her something to entertain herself with while he’s away. He enters the store and describes his predicament to the shopkeeper. “If you are interested, I have something in the back room that you may be interested in” says the man. The man agrees and him and the shopkeeper heads to the back where the shopkeeper retrieves an old cryptic looking box. He opens it to reveal a hand. “This is the magic hand” says the shopkeeper. “You have to be joking, right?” Says the man. “That’s just a mannequin hand!” The shopkeeper shakes his head and says to the man, “No no no sir, this is much more than that, this hand will come to life and do whatever you want, you simply give it a location to go. Care to try it in private?” So the man takes the hand into the bathroom, looks at the hand, and says “Magic hand, my dick!” All of a sudden, the hand comes to life, unzips the mans pants, and gives him a *flattering* rub down. The man rushes back to the shopkeeper and exclaims “I’ll take it!” So the man goes home, gives the gift to his wife, explains how it works, and then leaves for his trip. The wife, a bit cautious and doubtful, goes into the bedroom, removes her pants and underwear, and says “Magic hand, my pussy!” At once the hand leaps to life and gets to work. At first it’s wonderful, but after 3 hours the woman can’t take it. She’s tired, she’s had multiple orgasms, and she needs to get the hand out. She commands it to stop, but it won’t, so she decides to try to get to the hospital. She starts driving but finds it hard as she’s swerving trying to stay focused. Then she sees the sirens. She gets pulled over and an officer walks up to the window. “Ma’am you were swerving an awful lot back there, are you under the influence of any drugs or alcohol?”  “Officer! Please help me, there’s a magic hand up my dress pleasuring me and it won’t stop, I just need to get to the hospital. “Yeah right!” Says the cop, smirking”  “Sure lady, magic hand my ass!”",The magic hand.

post,e75mxx,2qh72,jokes,false,1575671316,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/e75mxx/several_years_ago_a_group_of_artistic_polymaths/,self.jokes,,"Several years ago, a group of artistic polymaths decided to mathematically represent different styles of painting.

Each of the polymaths was a leading figure in a different field of mathematics, and each pursued and studied a different style of painting. Together, they decided that if they could create mathematical expressions for each style of art, they could decide which was superior.

The first polymath was an expert in isoperimetry, and he was absolutely obsessed with history. He fell in love with isoperimetry when he discovered its Greek roots and its slight link to Dido's problem. This polymath's passion for history bled into his artistic pursuits, as well; he found that the works of the old masters, particularly Renaissance artists, could never be topped. For most of his adulthood, he spent his downtime trying to replicate the painting of Renaissance artists in modern settings, but he could never quite get it right. Using his isoperimetric expertise, this polymath created a geometric formula that succinctly captured the essence of Renaissance paintings. He called this the Renaissance Equation.

The second polymath was an expert in set theory and an outspoken advocate for Impressionism. He found beauty in the way impressionists introduced the movement of life into their paintings in the same way he felt he encapsulated the movement of objects between sets. Impressionism and set theory, for this polymath, were two sides of the same coin—two objects in the same set. He decided to use set theory to categorize and represent the necessary and sufficient qualities for something to be considered impressionist to create a fuzzy set with extremities reaching from not-impressionist to impressionist.  Ultimately, this led to a breakthrough that led to an algorithm that could categorize any painting on an impressionist spectrum, and this perfect categorization furthered his belief that impressionism was the most beautiful style of painting. He called this the Impressionist Explanation.

The third polymath was an expert in isomorphisms. He saw true beauty in the ways in which an isomorphism could be distinguished, and could not be distinguished, based on the elements of the morphism from which they were reversed and inverted. This polymath believed that the value of isomorphisms, more than anything else in mathematics, depended on the perspective of the viewer. He looked at Neo-Surrealism in much the same way; from some perspectives, two isomorphisms could be differentiated in the same way two Neo-Surrealist paintings could be. With this in mind, he mathematically mapped countless Neo-Surrealist paintings and built an algorithm that could utilize much of his research into isomorphisms to differentiate between them. His results, which suggested that Neo-Surrealist paintings were all isomorphisms, proved to him that his favorite genre of art was superior. He called his work the Neo-Surrealist Formula.

The final polymath was an expert in orthogonal matrices and a lover of Cubism. He viewed matrices as the foundation of higher mathematical thought, and because the determinant of an orthogonal matrix must always be 1 or negative 1, he believed his study to be the purest form of mathematics. As an extension of this, he believed that anything outside of mathematics focused on invertible, square-based conceptions of reality were the optimal way to understand the world. Naturally, he fell into Cubism. Though Cubism did not represent perfectly orthogonal figures, this polymath believed this was not a failure of Cubism, but a failure of art as a whole—the need to portray broader themes caused the cubes not to be perfectly orthogonal. Despite this, the fourth polymath traced the primary vectors in the most prominent paintings of each genre, and he found that the vectors in Cubist paintings most closely resembled the orthonormal vectors he had long studied. He published his findings as the Cubism Experiment.

After the four polymaths had completed their individual projects, they convened to discuss their results. Even after seeing the work the others had put in, each polymath still trusted his own mathematical formula and believed his favorite genre of art was the best. To reach a final conclusion, the mathematicians decided to submit their findings in a single bundle to a group of neutral mathematicians from all over the world. They combined their work into a single expression of paintings, which they called Paintings: Renaissance, Impressionist, Neo-Surrealist, and Cubist Expressions. 

The group of neutral mathematicians was astounded by the work put into this, and they published it for the world to see. Within weeks of publication, this set of data became widely known as the artists’ formulae known as PRINCE.","Several years ago, a group of artistic polymaths decided to mathematically represent different styles of painting.",11

Gilbert Gottfried’s grandson, Greg, comes up and asks “do you write all your dirty jokes? You know, the ones with the humping, the handjobs, the anal. Do you write them from recent experience? Or did you just use old ones you wrote when you were in your 20’s?” 

“What the hell do you mean?!” Exclaims Gilbert. 

“Well, I mean, you and grandma are really getting old, so I thought all your sex related jokes were just inspired from the times when you were getting some”

“You’re an asshole! I’ll show you how I write new material!” He runs up stairs and starts having rough sex with Greg’s grandmother. 

After 15 minutes of banging and loud, nasally moaning, gilbert comes back down stairs and eats some cereal. 

After five minutes of uncomfortable silence, Greg finally asks. “So, what kind of joke will you write from that, grandpa?”

post,e72dsw,2qh72,jokes,false,1575656543,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/e72dsw/the_elf/,self.jokes,,"Helm, Craig and Dan lived together as roommates in a small house. Craig and Dan started to grow weary of Helm for one reason, and that reason was his elf. 

The elf was an irritating little fellow. He would constantly make a huge mess around the house, eat all the food, scream at and even bite Craig and Dan and well, wouldnt exactly use the toilet whenever he needed to do his business. Regardless of all this, Helm refused to kick him out of the house. Craig and Dan had enough. So they came up with the extreme idea to just kill the thing. 

They devised how they were going to kill the elf, they were going to make it look like a suicide, they just needed the right time. Helm and the elf were constantly together so finding the perfect time to strike was rather difficult. 

They monitored them continuously and found out Helm regularly visited a friend named Stein, and Helm would call Stein occasionally to see if he was free to hang out. If Stein was, Helm would ask the elf to stay home. But these visits were so random, Craig and Dan weren't sure when to be ready or not. One day after Helm finished a phone conversation, he seemed rather frustrated. 

""What's up buddy?"" asked Craig. 

""Its Stein. We used to hang out constantly but he recently took up knitting and now hes obsessed. Only after he's done knitting is he willing to hang out."" said Helm. 

This gave Craig an idea. He went to Dan and explained it to him. 

""I know the right time to get that elf. If we know when Helms friend finishes knitting, we know Helm will go out and his elf will be left all alone!"" said Craig

So they kept track of Stein and sure enough, astoundingly every single time he finished knitting, he would call Helm and they go would hang out. 

They decided on a day to finally get ready and rid their lives of the pesky elf once and for all. Dan was to be stationed outside of Steins house and Craig at their house with Helm and the elf, then when Helm left, Craig would strike.

Dan reaches the house, peeks through a window but doesnt see Stein and at the same moment, Helm leaves the house. Craig calls Dan. 

""Hey Helm left and it's just me and the elf, but I didnt catch him having any phone calls, is Stein there?"" 

""I dont know, I need to keep looking"" 

Dan goes around looking through the rest of the windows but couldn't find him. 

""I cant see him, but he could be upstairs or something"" said Dan

"" You have to find out. We need to know if this is truely the right time to kill it"" said Craig. 

So Dan hatches an idea. He hangs up and walks up to the front door and rings the door bell. Steins wife opens the door and greets him. 

""Hello! Do you by any chance know where Stein is?"" asks Dan. 

""Oh I dont know. All I know is after he finished knitting a couple socks, he just got up and left"" said Steins wife. 

""Okay thanks for letting me know"" said Dan and he left. He pulls his phone out and calls Craig. 

""Well? Did he knit?"" asked Craig nervously. 

Dan responded ""Yep, Stein did knit. Kill Helms elf"".",The Elf,1

This was a momentous idea that he just had, and he thought it best to experiment on his favourite food item: Matzo balls.

The scientist made a matzo ball, and after much trial and error he believed he had done it. There was one problem however, the matzo ball had become shy and was very scared to speak. The scientist decided that he would force it to talk by subjecting it to various dangers and hoping it yells out for help.

First he placed the matzo ball on a plate with other, non talking matzo balls. He had some volunteers go and eat the balls but avoid the talking one. He hoped that the matzo ball would become scared and cry out. However, he was shocked to find a single matzo ball left on the plate with no records of it making any noise. He was sure it could talk, it just wouldn't.

Next he attempted to accidentally knock the matzo ball onto the floor of a busy lab. He instructed other scientists to step over the ball, but only just. After a 3 hr lab session, he was shocked to find the matzo ball still hadn't talked. At this point he was fed up and decided to cut his losses; But not without getting a tasty meal out of it.

He tied the matzo ball to a string and set it over a vat of boiling oil, intending to deepfry the dish. He ever so slowly dropped it towards the pot, to savour the moment and maybe to hear it talk before he ate it. As the matzo ball got closer and closer to the pot it begun to fear for its ""life"" believing that this was no longer an experiment. Suddenly, in the quite kitchen, the matzo ball spoke up in a hushed voice: 

""I guess you expect me to talk?""

The scientist had a smirk on his face as he contemplated his next words: ""no matzo ball, i expect you to fry!""",One day a scientist had a brilliant idea,7

Here the Chief meets them and tells them:

""Welcome here on our Island, we will gladly let you live with our tribe but you have to prove yourselves worthy first. I give you a mission, to go inland, in the jungle and bring 5 fruits each for the ritual !""

So here the 3 fellows accept and run straight for the forrest and go separate ways

The frenchman is the first to come back, with 5 grapes.

The chief: ""Great, now with the ritual, you're going to shove these grapes up your ass, one by one and you will be welcome to live with our tribe; BUT ! If you laugh during the process we will sacrifice you to our gods, that is the tradition""

Several people noticed her sitting in her car with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her head.   
   
One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and walked over to the car. He noticed that Linda's eyes were now open, and she looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied that she'd been shot in the back of the head, and had been holding her brains in for over an hour.   
   
The man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her head.  When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough on the back of her head. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains.  She initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her brains in for over an hour until someone noticed and came to her aid.

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""
OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""
""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""
A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.
After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.
So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""
Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

He walks up to him and whispered in his ears: “I know everything about that dirty little secret of yours, now give me ten bucks, or else.” Shocked, his father scrambled for words: “What? But how did you... Never mind, fine, here. Just whatever you do, don’t tell your mother.” And Jerry’s father handed him ten bucks.

Pocket full of cash and heart filled with excitement, Jerry ran outside to the front yard and found their neighbor, Mr. Smith mowing his lawn. Jerry decides to try the trick on Mr. Smith as well. 

Jerry ran up to Mr. Smith and said: “Mr. Smith, sir, there’s something I have to tell you.” Mr. Smith turned off his lawn mower and asked: “Well what is it, little buddy?” Jerry closed in and whispered in his ears: “I know everything about that dirty little secret of yours, now give me ten bucks, or else.”

“I’m afraid I owe you more than ten bucks.” Said Mr. Smith: “So your mother told you huh? Well what’re you waiting for? Come here and give me a hug, son.”","Michael and Jerry are two third graders in the same school. One day, Michael told Jerry: “I just learned a neat trick that made me twenty bucks yesterday.”",35

Me: ""Oh, no. 'Fuck You Dude.' It's the name of the song.""

The owner just kinda shrugs it off and tells me to show him what else I've got.  I play him another song, and he walks over, looking a bit apprehensive this time.

Owner: ""So uhh, whats that one called?

Me: ""It's called 'Your Mom's a Bitch.'""

Owner: ""Man, you've got the job, but we'll have to do something about those song names.""

So fast-forward to Friday night.  I'm playing, the crowd's feeling it, I'm feeling it, and everyone is buying me drinks because we're all having a good time.  Because of this, I have to step away from the keys for a moment to go drain the lizard.  I'm on my way back to stage when an angry woman stops me. She says, ""Excuse me sir. Do you know your pants are unzipped and your dick's hanging out?""

Trying to calm her down, I exclaim to her, ""Know it?? Lady, I WROTE IT!""",The local bar in town was looking for a piano player to play on weekends,49

The doctor is giving them a tour around the hospital, bragging about what an outstanding reputation it has. He claims that they are the leading hospital in treating rare disorders and afflictions.

As the doctor and visitor pass by a patient's room, they sae a man furiously masturbating. He has no blanket covering him, nor privacy curtain drawn. To the amazement of the visitor, the nurse in the room proceeds to go about checking his vitals and chart as of nothing was out of the ordinary.

""My god!"" Gasped the visitor ""What is that man doing!?""

The doctor quickly flipped through his notes. ""Oh, you see, this man has an incredibly rare disorder where if he stops masturbating, his heart will explode.""

""Oh my,"" said the visitor ""that poor man. What a terrible life to lead.""

With that, they continue down the hall until they happen across another room with the door wide open. The man inside is laying back in bliss while a pretty young nurse is enthusiastically sucking his dick.

""Oh my god!"" Screams the visitor ""What on earth is going on here? This is completely unacceptable!""

Once again, the doctor flips through his notes. ""Oh. You see, this patient has the same disorder as the last one, but his health insurance is significantly better.""",[NSFW] A doctor is giving a tour of a local hospital,3136

'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...
How to live in a world that's politically correct?

His workers no longer would answer to ""Elves,""
""Vertically Challenged"" they were calling themselves.

And labour conditions at the north pole
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.

Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.

And equal employment had made it quite clear
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.

So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!

The runners had been removed from his sleigh;
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.

And people had started to call for the cops
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.

Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.
His fur-trimmed red suit was called ""Unenlightened.""

And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose

And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.

So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,
Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,

Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.

And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.

Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.

Nothing that might be construed to pollute.
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.

Nothing that clamoured or made lots of noise.
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.

Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.
Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.

No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.

And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.

For they raised the hackles of those psychological
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.

No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.

Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.

So Santa just stood there, dishevelled, perplexed;
He just could not figure out what to do next.

He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,
But you've got to be careful with that word today.

His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.

Something special was needed, a gift that he might
Give to all without angering the left or the right.

A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,
Each group of people, every religion;

Every ethnicity, every hue,
Everyone, everywhere...even you.

So here is that gift, its price beyond worth...
""May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.""

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,8

A personal example of how I do this is with my own health. I’ve had the digestive problem IBS since I was a teenager. It’s not the easiest thing in the world to live with sometimes. Medication makes a big difference though. .... 
So anyway one day when I was dealing with this stuff I got the idea to make a joke out of it. ....


If you don’t have IBS, I’m gonna explain to you exactly what it is so you understand. This is probably the most accurate way I can think of to describe it....


.....


If you’re someone who suffers from IBS, you understand that there is a much more literal meaning to the phrase “rip a new a**hole.” 


.....


When you have an IBS episode, you suddenly realize that you’re not too different from a volcano!


.....


When you have IBS, the most offensive thing someone can say to you is “sh*t happens.” You take that phrase literally.


.....


If you have IBS, you know that eating at Taco Bell will probably kill you.


.....


If you have IBS, you probably have some idea of what labor pains are like.


.....


If you have IBS, you get a daily adrenaline rush of having to run full speed to the bathroom and get your pants off in time!... It’s like a pit stop in a NASCAR race. You gotta time everything just right or your day is ruined.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what the ground under a nuclear detonation feels like. It’s one heck of an explosion.


.....


When you have IBS, you know what it’s like to walk like a duck for a short period of time every morning.


.....


If you have IBS, you probably know what it’s like to do squat exercises over a pit of molten lava.


.....


If you have IBS, you know how embarrassing it is to have your legs fall asleep on the toilet. ..... You get up afterwards and you about fall straight forward into the wall in front of you.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what undigested, flaming Chipotle feels like.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what it’s like to light a firecracker in your a**.


.....


If you have IBS, you often find yourself sprinting to the bathroom while yelling “Run for your lives! Krakatoa’s about to erupt!”


.....


Hopefully y’all have an understanding of what irritable bowel syndrome is now.",Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Warning: joke does contain some curse words),2

""Listen"", he said. ""I need someone to trim my sideburns. I can't do it myself anymore because i got so many wrinkles and shaky hands.""

""No problem"", said the barber. ""You're not the first one with this problem old friend, just keep this small wooden ball in your mouth and press it against your cheek while i trim your sideburns there.""

So the man takes the wooden ball in his mouth and follows the barber's directions. 

""Well i'll be damned! This is the cleanest shave i've had in years"", cries the old man.

""i've got to ask though"", said the old man. ""What would've happened if i accidentally swallowed the ball?"".   
""Oh not a problem"", said the barber. ""It happens quiete often. People just return the ball the next day"".",So i was at the barbershop the other day.,60

Now Gwong was a crazy SOB. Gwong would cut people's genitals off and glue em to his own missing parts. Everyone was scared of this guy but unfortunately due to the fact that the legal system is flawed he gets an insanity plea and is put in a mental hospital.

Gary has been working at this exact hospital for about 5 years. Mostly he deals with schizos, suicidal folks, and a group of people who think they are someone else. 

These people would usually switch personalities every few weeks based on what movies were out. During the 90s they were skaters, ww2 soldiers, and then Neo from the Matrix.

Gary personally gets creeped out by the crowd and is known for calling them in a lot and getting the whole guard unit to tackle em and send em to their rooms. They don't seem to mind too much and it keeps Gary sane.

So anyway Gwong is transferred in to this facility and he gets put in Gary's ward. Gary is terrified. Everywhere he goes he's wigging out, worried his dick is gonna get glued to Gwong's pelvis and flop around while he bleeds out on the floor. Luckily the only time of day that Gwong is free from a straight jacket is during lunch time. Gwong goes around and does his best to make friends but everyone else is afraid of this guy on account of the dick cutting. Well Gwong finds a table, its the group who changes personalities who currently are Thanos from Avengers.

Gwong sits and chats with them about anger, genocide, and hating society. Eventually he mentions the new movie The Joker to them and how a whole crowd of people dressed as clowns to show solidarity with the chatacter. Gwong starts thinking he has a solid plan to bust out by utilizing these weirdies but instead a ruckuss rises from the group. 3 guys claim they are the Joker and the rest of the crowd has painted their face white with their mashed potatos.

Gary sees what's going on and who is causing it and starts to panic thinking that Gwong is gonna start a riot and escape. Gary's mind flashes to the mental image of his dick swaying in the wind on Gwong's groin. 

Gary starts seperating the group into two sides, not noticing Gwong behind him. After clearing em out on to opposite sides of the room he turns around to see Gwong, knife in hand, smiling. 

Gary's final words over the radio were ""I got clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle the Yu.""",Bit of a long one but I hope you guys enjoy,2
