I was sitting in an atacac with 50 eals stuffed in my dickhole. i could feel them moving. A guy in a black suit began to put the eyeballs of a kid that had down sindrome in my nose.
You can smell vision now he said to me. i snorted them up and ate them. The man then takes of his black suit to reveal that he is made of used condoms, he then proceeds to
stick his fingers down my throat, condom man says ""I'm testing your gag reflex to see how many fetuses I could fit in there."" as another man made of large purple dildos walks in with
a bucket of abortions. He shoved 1 in. then another and another and another. I found it desgusting but it tasted so good. I chewed the ear off my dead twin. 
I could feel my dick getting hard. harder then ever before. The dildo man puts me down and stickes his entire head in my asshole tearing me from inside out. He pops out covered in blood
tasty he says.
My now gaping asshole is a pleasent sight condom and dildio man. They get excited and invite another friend of theres, the virgin mary. The 3 of them begin to fuck my brains out,
it hurts but I can't stop them they're almost about cum. All 3 stick there enrmas cocks in my gaping ass. The blood lubing everything. For 1 final jizz. I can fell it building up in  my ass
My insides out. My insestines were on the flood but they kept going. And then that was it. They jizzed a mighty jizz in sync together. Waves of jizz were pouring out of my ass. It would never stop. 
The room was filling with my insides and jizz. I was going to drown.
As my vision fades I feel something grab my ass and pull me to the surface of the jizz flood, I look up and it's guy sebastion starring at my ruined rectum. He moves closer to
get a little sniff but after the brutal gangbang I just had I've had enough of my asshole being ruptured. I push back into the flood of jizz and drown him. 
The jizz tasted like beef as it creamed into my mouth. Everyone was yelling suck to me. I grabed a vacume and put it in my ass and sucked everything it. all the jizz was compacted to my ass. i coould feel it ready to explode
My dick was not yet satisfied yet.
So I grabbed some shards of glass and began plesuring myself wih the broken pieces of glass. Therer was so much blood, a mixture of cum and blood, it looked beautiful.
I was ashamed of my actions so I grabbed an iron and burnt my balls to a crisp. Next was the foreskin. I grabbed some scissors and gave myself a home circumcision.

yummy

sweetheart's birthday, and as they had not been dating very

long, after careful consideration, he decided a pair of

gloves would strike the right note: romantic, but not too

personal.

Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to

Myers and bought a pair of white gloves.

The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During

the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got

the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without

checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and

sent it to his sweetheart with the following note:

I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the

habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had

not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones

with the buttons, but she wears short ones that are easier to

remove.

These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from

showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three

weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for

me and she looked really smart. I wish I was there to put

them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will

come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you

again.

When you take them off, remember to blow in them before

putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp

from wearing.

Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming

year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night. All

my love.

P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a

little fur showing.""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. 
Do you think I could stay the night?
the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car
As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound
The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,
We can't tell you. You're not a monk.
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.
Some years later,
The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.
The monks again accept him, feed him, even fix his car
That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.
The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.
If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?
The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles When you find these numbers,
you will become a monk.
The man sets about his task.
Some years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.
He says,
I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are
145,236,284,232 blades of grass and
231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth
The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk
We shall now show you the way to the sound.
The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says,
The sound is right behind that door.
The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.
He says, Real funny. May I have the key?
The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone
The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.
He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door this one made of sapphire,
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,
silver,
topaz,
and amethyst.
Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.
The man is relieved to know end.
He unlocks the door,
turns the knob,
and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound

The couple spot this and Sam tries to swat the bee away. Freaking out, the bee begins to go inside and buries itself deep inside her Vag.


It is now the couples turn to freak out and they begin ranting and raving, attracting the attention of a male passer by (John). After calming the couple down a little, they begin to explain to him how there is a bee deep insider her Vag.


John has an idea, that Sam should rub honey onto his Penis and insert it into Julie's Vag which should attract the bee, which in turn should make the bee get out. The couple thinks this is a good idea to try but unfortunately Sam can't rise to the occasion.


John however has a raging erection and not wanting to pass up potentially penetrating the beautiful Julie, he wearily suggests that he be the one to do it. Sam is hesitant but can see how much discomfort Julie is in, so he allows this.

With that, John honey's up his Penis and inserts it into Julies V. The bee however is having none of it, so John starts slowly going in deeper and deeper but the bee is still not budging. John says ""screw this"" and goes in as deep as he can and starts thrusting as hard as he can...


Whilst Julie starts moaning with excitement, Sam loses it and yells at John asking him ""What the fuck do you think you're doing !!""  - To which John replies ""There's been a change of plan mate................ I'm going to drown the little bastard!""",Nudist Dilemma (Very NSFW),1

One day, however, he hears a knock at the door. He opens it and sees a big burly Georgian with a thick black beard, missing a few teeth, wearing dirty overalls and no shoes.

Before the guy can say anything, the Georgian says, “I come over to invite you to my birthday party tonight.”

“Birthday party?” asks the guy.

“Yeah,” replies the Georgian. “You like drinkin’?”

“Oh sure,” says the guy. “I’ve been known to put away a few at a party.”

“Well, we’re gonna drink all night,” says the Georgian. “Beer, whiskey, bourbon, vodka, even some of Daddy’s moonshine. You like dancin’?”

“You bet,” says the guy.

“Well, we’re gonna dance all night too,” says the Georgian. “Fast dancin’, slow dancin’, square dancin’, line dancin’, gonna do it all. You like to fight?”

“Well, not really,” says the guy, “but I guess I can defend myself if I need to.”

“Well, I gotta warn ya,” says the Georgian, “there’s always a big ol’ fight near the end of these parties. Gets pretty fierce. Sometimes people get hurt. You like sex?”

“Why, sure,” says the guy.

“That’s good,” says the Georgian, “because after the fightin’ there’s always a lot of sex. All night long, sex, sex, sex: till the sun comes up the next morning.”

“I’ll be there!” says the guy, dazzled by the prospect of a night of drinking, dancing, fighting, and sex. “So what do people wear to a party like this?”

“Don’t matter,” says the Georgian as he walks away. “It’s only gonna be you and me.”",Party Down South,14

Tired of constantly having to rebuild, they decided it was time for action. One day, the leader of the ants gathered everyone and gave a marvelous speech:

""Today is the day we stand up and rise up above this pesky Elephant!""

Millions of ants cheered in excitement. He then said:

""I mean literally, we're all going to climb up this tree right here that's next to our colony, wait until the Elephant comes and when he's right under us, we're going to jump on him and every single one of us is gonna give him everything we've got! - Defend the colony!!""

All ants again cheered in excitement and followed the leader up the tree. 

Hours passed while all the ants waited patiently under the hot sun when all of a sudden, the branches on the tree started to shake.

""Here comes the Elephant!"" the leader said, ""Everyone hold your positions and wait for my signal!""

As the Elephant passed under the tree, the leader waited until he was sure all of the ants would land right on the middle of his back and yells ""NOW!!! JUMP!!!""

Millions of ants jump on the elephant, if you could see it from a distance, it was as if a giant red blanket fell from the tree onto the elephant's back.

The elephant felt a slight tickle and shook himself off. All the ants fell to the ground except for one, who gave everyone on the ground a horrified look.

In silence, all the ants look to the leader as he looks up and yells:

He has everything a billionaire could possibly have including: tennis courts, go cart track, mini-golf, private airplane, and a huge mansion.  The main attraction however is the biggest swimming pool you've ever seen, and inside that pool, the worlds biggest alligator. 


At the end of the party he makes a announcement, 'Before everyone leaves Id like to make a challenge, Whoever can swim across my swimming pool without getting eaten by the alligator can have one of three things. (1. A billion dollars) (2. Half my estate) (or 3. My daughters hand in marriage). No one however has the guts to do so and the party ends and everyone goes home.


 The very next year he throws another party's just like the first and at the very end he challenges someone to the same challenge as before. However no one has the guts the 2nd year either and everyone leaves.


 The third year comes and he decides to throw one more party, and at the end of the party he gives his challenge one more time. Just as he is finishing saying what he will give the lucky guy who can swim across, He hears a splash of someone jumping in. He looks over to see this guy swimming as fast as he possibly can across the pool with the alligator chasing after him. Everyone in town is cheering him on as the alligator is snapping it's jaw at his feet. The man reaches the end of the pool and 3 men pull him up as the alligator snaps his shoe off.


 The billionaire rushes over and he exclaims, 'THAT WAS THE BRAVESET THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! Which choice do you want out of the three?!?! The man is breathing so heavily he can't speak. The bilionare asks, 'Do you want a billion dollars?' The man replies with heavy breathing 'No no No'. The billionaire responds with 'You're a smart man you must want half my estate'. The man replies with heavy breathing still 'No No gasp No'. The billionaire goes 'Ok you are even smarter than I thought. You may have my daughters hand in marriage.' The man replies still breathing heavily 'No No I don't want your daughter'. The billionaire now confused asks 'Than what do you possibly want?!?!?!'

Wonder no more!!
It is a known fact that the penguin is a very ritualistic bird which lives an extremely ordered and complex life. The penguin is very committed to its family and will mate for life, as well as maintain a form of compassionate contact with its offspring throughout its life.

If a penguin is found dead on the ice surface, other members of the family and social circle have been known to dig holes in the ice, using their vestigial wings and beaks, until the hole is deep enough for the dead bird to be rolled into, and buried.
The male penguins then gather in a circle around the fresh grave and sing:



""Freeze a jolly good fellow.""

Then, they kick him in the ice hole.",Where do dead penguins go? [long],4

So they arranged the heist and snuck into the zoo.  As one of the scientists was creeping around the grounds, he accidentally fell into the lion pit.  Fortunately, the massive beasts were asleep and so he climbed out the other side of the pen and quickly nabbed the birds.

Seeing no easy exit from the aviary, he tiptoed back through the lion encampment and climbed back out.  Upon exiting the zoo, their entire party was arrested by a waiting policeman.

Theresa May becomes the PM of UK

I know, you told me while back. When you will know?

When will I know what?

If Theresa becomes PM or not?

I already know!

Then tell me!

I told you!

What?

That Theresa May becomes PM of UK 

Right, so when will you know for sure? 

I already know for sure! 

Then why don't you tell me what you know for sure!

I'm telling you! I know for sure that Theresa May becomes PM of the UK.

So, all you know for sure is that Theresa *may* become PM of the UK,  right?   So when will you know with 100% certainty about her becoming the PM of the UK?

I told you! I already know with 100% certainty! 

What?

That Theresa May becomes the PM of the UK.

There you go again!  That is not knowing with 100% certainty. 

Yes it is! I know with 100% certainty!

Aaaaargh! Okay, you know who is the PM of the UK?

Yes!  

Who?

Theresa May!

There you go again!  I'm asking you if you know who is the PM of the UK at this very moment?

Yes!

Who?

Theresa May!

I'm not asking you who *may be* the PM of the UK?  I'm asking you who *is* the PM of UK right now? 

And I'm telling you, Theresa May!

Aaargh! ..... Okay you know the British Parliament?  

Yes!

You know there is a leader of the parliament?

Yes!

What is the title of that leader?

The Prime Minister!

Good, now we're getting somewhere. Now that Prime Minister attends the Parliament?  

Yes, of course!

Okay, now does the Prime Minister have an office or a desk or a reserved chair at the parliament?

But of course!  Wouldn't be much of a parliament building without one of those now, would it?

Good.  Now if you we're to visit the British Parliament tomorrow and look at the name plate on that office or desk or chair, what would it say?

""Reserved for the right honorable prime minister""

What name will it say?

No name!

What do you mean no name?  

This is not you local car dealership. They are British. They stay with titles, those are much more important.

Aaargh!  Okay, okay, tomorrow morning when the parliament starts, who is going to sit in that reserved chair?

Theresa May.

Aha!  So you don't know for sure who!

No, I know for sure, Theresa May.

Oh, here we go again!  Okay, do they pay them in the British Parliament?

Of course, each and every one of them.

Good, so when the PM goes to collect the pay at the end of the month who gets the money?

Theresa May.

I'm not asking you who *may* pick up the money! I'm asking who *will* pick up the money?

Theresa May.

Aaaargh! .....   (thinking) ..... So you are telling me that you are pretty certain that Theresa *may* become the next PM of the UK.

No, I'm telling you that I'm 100% certain that Theresa May becomes the PM of the UK.

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard.

Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

I have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN. OKAY!
Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull  fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only get
those sick headaches once a day. 

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live, because of the burned out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

Yes Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to being grrandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the love, devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a chld. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our pre-marital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.
Dear Mother and Dad: It has now been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN. OKAY!

I know you will welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know your oft expressed tolerance will not
permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told that his father is an important gun-bearer in the
village in Africa from which he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital,  I am not pregnant,  I am  not engaged. I do not have
syphillis and there is no man (of any color) in my life. However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours-

post,4sr3xg,2qh72,jokes,false,1468465626,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4sr3xg/calculus/,self.jokes,,"The setting is Ohio State University about six or seven years ago in a huge lecture hall (approximately 1000 students) for a Calculus final.  Apparently this particular calculus teacher wasn't very well
liked.  He was one of those guys who would stand at the front of the class and yell out how much time was remaining before the end of a test, a real charmer.  Since he was so busy galavanting around the room making sure that nobody cheated and that everyone was aware of how much time they had left before their failure of the test was complete, he had the students stack the completed tests on the huge podium at the front of the room.  This made for quite a mess, remember there were 1000 
students in the class.

Anyway, during this particular final, one guy entered the test needing a decent grade to pass the class.  His only problem with Calculus was that he did poorly when rushed, and this ass standing in the front of the room barking out how much time was left before the tests had to be handed in didn't help him at all.  He figured he wanted to assure himself of a good grade, so he hardly flinched when the professor said ""pencils down and submit your scan-tron sheets and work to piles at the front of the room"".

Five minutes turned into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into forty...almost an hour after the test was ""officially over"", our friend finally put down his pencil, gathered up his work, and headed to the front of the hall to submit his final.  The whole time, the professor sat at the front of the room, strangely waiting for the student to complete his exam. ""What do you think you're doing?"" the professor asked as the student stood in front of him about to put down his exam on one of the neatly stacked piles of exams (the professor had plenty of time to stack the mountain of papers while he waited)  It was clear that the professor had waited only to give the student a hard time.

""Turning in my exam,"" retorted the student confidently.  
""I'm afraid I have some bad news for you,"" the professor gloated, ""Your exam is an hour late.  You've FAILED it and, consequently, I'll see you next term when you repeat my course.""  
The student smiled slyly and asked the professor ""Do you know who I am?""  
""What?"" replied the professor gruffly, annoyed that the student showed no sign of emotion.  
The student rephrased the question mockingly, ""Do you know what my name is?""  
""NO"", snarled the professor.  
The student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said slowly, ""I didn't think so"", as he lifted up one of the stacks half way, shoved his test neatly into the center of the stack, let the stack fall burying his test in the middle, turned around and walked casually out of the huge lecture hall.",Calculus,9

A man is walking down the street when he notices a sign out front of a bar that says, ""If you can make my horse laugh, free food and drinks!"" Curious, the man walks into the bar and sits down. He asks the bartender about the sign out front and the bartender guarantees that he would keep his word. Pondering for a second, the man asks if he can have a moment alone with the horse to which the bartender agrees. Two minutes later, the man comes back in and the bartender can hear his horse laughing his ass off. The bartender then asks the man what he did, but the man does not tell. Keeping his word the man got free food and free drinks all night.

The next day the man is strolling by the bar again when he sees the sign this time and it says ""If you can make my horse cry, free food and free drinks!"" So the man decides to walk back in. The bartender notices the guy from the night before and asked if he was here for the challenge. The man agreed and asked for another 2 minutes alone with the horse. When he returned to the bar, the bartender can hear his horse crying and wailing in agony. Puzzled, the bartender had to know how the man did it. So after offering up free food and drinks again, the bartender made sure the man stay around to find out how he did it. After getting the man drunk, the bartender asks, ""Man, you gotta tell me what you did to my horse."" Drunkenly, the man says ""You really wanna know? Fine. Well you see the first night, I whispered in your horses ear that I had a bigger dick than he did. And as for the 2nd night, I came back and proved it.""",Free Dinner,13

Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Apparently, I’m still lost…",Funeral,18

You’ll walk again and everything. However, your penis was severed in the accident, and we couldn’t find it.”


The man groans, but the doctor goes on, “You have $9,000 in insurance compensation coming, and we now have the technology to build a new penis. They work great but don’t come cheap. It’s roughly $1,000 an inch.” The man perks up.


So,” the doctor says, “You must decide how many inches you want. But I understand that you have been married for over thirty years and this is something you should discuss with your wife. If you had a five-incher before and get a nine-incher now she might be a bit put out. If you had a nine-incher before and you decide to only invest in a five-incher now, she might be disappointed. It’s important that she plays a role in helping you make a decision.”


The man agrees to talk it over with his wife.

“Yes, I have,” says the man.
“And has she helped you make a decision?”
“Yes“, says the man.

Once in, Jeff orders 3 beers in a row and begins to drink them simultaneously... The bar tender thinks this a bit strange but nevertheless he is making business. 

Jeff frequents the bar, generally nightly and each time he orders 3 beers in a row, drinking them simultaneously... The bar tender/other patrons who are now friendly with Jeff, ask him why he does this.

Jeff begins to explain that he has 2 brothers, Sam &amp; Steve and before he left home to come to this new country, they made a pact that they would always order 3 beers at a time and drink them simultaneously as a memory of how they would always go out and be/drink together at bars. The bar tender and patrons are touched by this story.


This goes on and on until one day, Jeff comes in and orders 2 beers. Everyone in the bar goes silent. After a while the bar tender pulls Jeff aside and says to him ""I'm sorry for your loss, you must be devastated..."" - Jeff looks at him for a second and asks ""loss, what do you mean?"" - The bar tender informs Jeff of only ordering 2 beers and he presumed that one of the brothers must have passed on and Jeff says...

""Sir, Natalie is one of our most expensive ladies. Perhaps you would
 prefer someone else,"" said the madam. 

""No, I must see Natalie"" was the man's reply. Just then, Natalie
appeared  and announced to the man that she charged $1,000 a visit. Without
hesitation, the man pulled out ten one-hundred dollar bills and gave
them  to Natalie and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left.

The next night the same man appeared again, demanding to see Natalie.
Natalie explained that no one had ever come back two nights in a row -
too  expensive - and there were no discounts. The price was still $1,000.
Again the man pulled out the money, gave it to Natalie and they went
upstairs. After an hour, he left. 

The following night the man was there again. Everyone was astounded
that  he had come for the third consecutive night, but he paid Natalie and
they  went upstairs. After their session, Natalie questioned the man. ""No
one  has ever used me three nights in a row. Where are you from?"" she
asked.

The man replied, ""South Carolina."" ""Really?"" she said. ""I have family
in  South Carolina."" ""I know,"" the man said. ""Your father died and I am

""aah"" says the genie  ""that was a really good nap""  

So the lawyer asks him if he's the magical sort of genie who gives out wishes. The genie explains that indeed he is but with a catch: whatever the lawyer asks for, every other lawyer in the world gets double of.  

The lawyer, being the selfish fellow he is, almost leaves without making any wishes. But finally he decides that he might as well give it a shot. So first the lawyer says that he's always wanted a Ferrari and in not half a second his brand new Ferrari appears in the parking lot and the genie hands him the key. So now every lawyer in the world has two Ferarris.  

Then the lawyer thinks about what else he might want but realizes that he has a meeting in just 5 minutes so he asks for ten million dollars. And in not half a second a silver suitcase containing ten million dollars with crisp hundred dollar bills appears before his eyes.
  

The lawyer still can't get over the fact that every other lawyer now has TWENTY million dollars. So then the genie says, what is your third wish?  

So the lawyer thinks for a while and he finally says  

You know, I've always wanted to donate a kidney...

The man replied to him, ""You feel because I'm mad, that I'm also foolish? Get me off, and *then* I will pay you $20,000"".

The following day, the lawyer came to visit the madman in his chambers. He told the man, that anything the prosecutor or the judge asked him, he had to reply, 'You think you could fool me?"".

The lawyer told the madman to practice that line, and he did. When his trial started, the madman had the phrase locked down.

The magistrate started, ""On the 12th day of July, in the year of our Lord 2016, did you rape a woman in broad daylight?""

The madman replied, ""You think you could fool me?""

The magistrate, dumbfounded by his response, asked him, ""How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?""

The madman replied, ""You think you could fool me?""

The magistrate, at a loss for words, asked the man, ""What is your name?""

He replied, ""You think you could fool me?""

The judge realized that this case was a mental case. He ended up dismissing it.

As the madman was walking out of the courthouse, his lawyer came up to him and asked him, ""Hey! Where's my $20,000.""

They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear, and she too screams, ""No!"" and walks quickly away.

The madam is surprised that this ordinary looking man has asked for something so outrageous that her two girls will have nothing to do with him. She decides that only her most experienced lady, Betty, will do. Betty has never said no, and it's not likely anything would surprise her. So the madam sends her over to Johannes. They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and she screams, ""NO BLOODY WAY!"" and smacks him as hard as she can and leaves.

Madam is by now absolutely intrigued, having seen nothing like this in all her years of operating a brothel. She hasn't done the bedroom work herself for a long time, but she's sure she has said yes to everything a man could possibly ask for. She just has to find out what this man wants that has made her girls so angry. Besides she sees a chance to teach her employees a lesson.

So she goes over to Johannes and says that she's the best in the house and is available. She sits and talks with him. They frolic, giggle, drink and then she sits in his lap.

That Sunday, the man takes the advice, gets into the costume and hides behind a gravestone. Shortly, the nun appears and prays.

Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.

The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth.

This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him. Finally he could stand it no longer.

He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.

So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said, ""Big John doesn't pay!,"" the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, ""And why not?""

Suddenly he hears commotion from above. As he looks up his reactions quickly come into play and he catches something that was falling... It was a glass eye!

Jeff is no doubt startled by this, but he manages to hold onto the glass eye and not let it plummet to the ground. Jeff looks up and spots a lady leaning over her balcony saying her thanks... She informs Jeff of her room number and to come by at 8pm tonight to drop off the glass eye if he is free. Jeff schedules the outing.



At 8pm sharp, Jeff knocks on the ladies door and when she opens he is taken aback by how beautiful the lady is. She was also wearing a pretty skimpy outfit, showcasing her (assets so to speak) very fit body. Jeff suddenly remembers why he is at the apartment and hands the lady the glass eye that he caught and being a shy man turns to leave however the lady grabs him by the arm informing him of how grateful she is and leads him into her apartment.


After a scrumptious home cooked dinner that Jeff couldn't get enough of, the lady then proceeds to give Jeff an awesome massage. Once every muscle/bone in his body has been thoroughly massaged, the Lady then proceeds to take Jeff over to the bedroom where she bangs his brains out for the next few hours. 


After the 5th hardcore sex romp session, Jeff rolls off the lady and small talk ensues... Jeff being the shy guy, asks the lady if she does this with everyone and the lady says that she does all of this with Only Those That... (DUN-DUN-DUN)

Catch her eye


:D :P



Added edit: The lady has another glass eye in when she opens the door/meets up with Jeff at 8pm - she wasn't eyeless :O",Only those that... (NSFW),2

When I have panic I'm black.

When you're cold you look blue.
When you have panic you look yellow.
When you're sick you look green.

His job was to move straw back and forth, he would take new straw bales shipped in every morning, put the hay in wheelbarrows where prisoners would then bring the wheelbarrows to where it was needed. 

Every night, he had to bring the old and soiled hay used by the prisoners to a dump outside of the camp.  Every day, he was searched on his way into the camp, and then again when he left to be sure he wasn't helping the prisoners or stealing.

This went on for months. Eventually, the Allies overran the Nazis, and liberated the camp where the man worked. The overseer was thrown into prison by the allies to await trial for his cri
