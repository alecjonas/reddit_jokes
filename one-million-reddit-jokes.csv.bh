So it's midnight and this security guard is making his usual rounds outside some warehouse when all of a sudden, he sees a shadowy figure exit the building. The guard approaches to investigate and sees that it is a man with a bag. The guard calls to the man and asks him to reveal the contents of the bag. The man cooperates, and the guard sees that it is empty. He lets the man go. 

Midnight that next day, the guard is patroling. Again, he sees a shadowy figure, approaches it, and sees the same guy with a bag. He asks him to open it, and it is empty, so he is allowed to leave. This goes on for days, then weeks, and months, which eventually become years. 

The guard ends up retiring and goes to the park one sunny afternoon. He looks for a bench to sit, and to his surprise, he sees the ""midnight man"". The now-retired guard approaches him and asks if he could sit with him and the man says yes. They do some small talk, and after a while the guard says, 

""For years I've been working at that warehouse making sure that nothing gets stolen and I always saw you in the area with a bag. I knew you had to have been stealing something, but could never figure out what you stole.  Could you please let me know what it was? I swear i won't tell. I'm retired after all. All this time, I have been curious and need to put my mind at ease. ""

The man says to the guard,

""Oh, I was stealing bags.""",A security guard and a midnight shift,11

“What do you mean by that?”

And the professor goes “Let me give you an example. Do you have a doghouse?”

“Uh, yeah.”

“Well, then I’d assume you have a dog.”

“Yeah.”

“so i'll assume you have kids to”

“I do have kids. Two of ‘em actually.”

Every year a goat race takes place in the month of august . My neighbour who is 66 years old has been part of the race for about 11 years and has never won. This year he was confident ,he had placed a bet with almost everyone in the village that he would win.
On the day of the race his goat was a bit too aggressive. And was ramming into anything in sight . When the race began his goat ran faster than any goat in the history of the race .
Everyone wondered how did this happen ? What was his secret
'Opium' I asked 
""No...too costly"" he replied with no expression 
""Then what""
""Chilli""
""Chilli? How"" I asked
""Rubbed some in his ass"" he replied with a smart look
Things did not go in his favour though ...
After the race the goat didn't stop so he had to rub some in his ass go sprint as fast as the goat",Chilli,1

I took it home and found out it didn't work. So today, less than 48 hours later I took it back to the shop and asked if I could get a refund.
The girl in the shop told me “NO” even though I still had the receipt. I asked if I could get a replacement instead then. Again this person told me ""NO.""
I asked to talk to a manager now as I'm really not happy and I explained that I had bought the item, had got it home and it didn't work. The manager just smiled and told me to my face that I was ""OUT OF LUCK.""

Dear Tech Support,
Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and I noticed a distinct slowdown in the overall system performance, particularly in the flower and jewellery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.
In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as NEWS 5.0,MONEY 3.0 and CRICKET 4.1 . Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.
Please note that I have tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems but it just doesn't seem to work.
What can I do?
Signed,
........ ­ ­ ­.............. ­ ­. ­.

Reply...

DEAR Madam,
First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system ­ ­.
Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme. html and try to download Tears 6.2 and do not forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update.
If that application works as designed, Husband1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.

However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Beer 6.1.

Whatever you do, DO NOT under any circumstances install Mother-In-Law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources.)

In addition, please do not attempt to re install the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

To summarize - Husband 1.0 is a great OS You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance.

We recommend: Cooking 3.0 and reverting to Hot Looks 7.7.

Good Luck Madam!
IT SUPPORT DESK.

The reason why was so I could get a tumor out of my eyeball, which was usually a sign of cancer in people in their 50s-60s, not when they are 12. So when I was in the waiting room for my surgery, the anesthesiologist came in wondering if I wanted to go to sleep before I went into the surgery room, but I was perfectly fine. He was pretty shocked at this yet wanted to kill the time so he asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and he said, ""what do you call a cow with no legs?"" Obviously, ""ground beef,"" but he asked if I had any jokes. And I replied with, ""How do you wake up Lady Gaga?"" And the answer is ""you poke-r face."" This gave the anesthesiologist quite a laugh and he walked out.

They are presented to the Chieftain of Chuu Chuu to stand trial. The whole village is gathered to watch the foreigners get their sentence. 

The explorers step up to the Chieftain and he speaks in his deep voice: 
""You are deemed guilty of conspiring to steal the Golden Skull.  You can choose between two punishments. Death or Chuu Chuu!""

The second explorer is choked as he step up to announce his punishment of choice. He thinks to himself 'I don't wish to die, and those 10 African men look tired after that train they ran on him'. 

The Chieftain ask: ""What is your choice? Death or Chuu Chuu?"" So he makes his announcement: ""I choose Chuu Chuu""

A year later, the reporter has returned to cover another story. This time, she notices that the women are now walking 10 steps ahead of the men.

""Taste it,"" he said

The guy tasted it he said

""This tastes just like biscuits!""

The inventor told him to flip it over and try the other side

""WOW, this side tastes like gravy!""

He asks if he can patent it and the guy said

""Man I'm sorry I still cant patent it, I wish I could""

About a week later the inventor comes in again and puts an apple on the table

""We've already been through this"", he said

He is asked to try it and one side tastes like peanut butter, the other one tastes like jelly

He asks ""Can I patent this?""

He is again rejected and starts to walk out when an idea pops into his head

""If I make an apple that tastes like pussy will you patent it""

The guy perks up and responds with the most resounding 

""YES""

The man comes back about a month later and puts an apple on the table

The man raises an eyebrow.

""Is this what I think It is""

The inventor says yes

The man takes the biggest bite in the apple and starts gagging and puking and he spits out the apple and throws it away

Place your right index finger and thumb on both sides of the cat's mouth and gently apply some pressure while holding the pill in the other hand. As soon as your cat opens the mouth, throw the pill in and give the cat the opportunity to swallow.

Find the pill off the floor and remove the cat from behind the couch. Place the cat in the curve of your arm again and repeat the process.

Remove the cat from the bedroom and throw away the dirty damp pill.

Take a new pill from the box, grab the cat in your arm again while holding both front legs tightly. Push the jaws up and push the pill in with the right index finger. Keep the cat's mouth closed for at least 10 seconds.

Remove the pill from the goldfish bowl and the cat from the top of the cupboard. Call your spouse out of the garden.

Kneel on the floor and force your cat between your knees and take a firm hold of its paws. Ignore the low growling. Have your partner hold the cup firmly and open the mouth two with a wooden ruler. Throw the pill in through the ruler and rub the cat's throat firmly to stimulate swallowing.

Remove your cat from the curtain rail and take a new pill from the box. Make a note to buy a new ruler and repair the curtains. Wipe the broken statuettes and vases to the side for later cleaning up or possibly gluing.

Turn your cat in a large towel and let your partner lie on the cat, so that the cat's head is just visible from under his armpit. Suck the pill with a straw and force the mouth open. Blow the pill through the straw in the cat's throat.

Check the package leaflet to be sure that these pills are harmless to people and have a beer to wash away the taste. Disinfect your partner's arm and put a bandage around it. Remove the blood stains from the floor covering.

Get your cat off the roof of the neighbor's shed. Grab a new pill and have another beer. Place your cat in the kitchen cupboard in such a way that the cat's head just sticks out. Force the mouth open and shoot the pill down your pet's throat with a rubber band.

Remove a screwdriver from the garage and put the kitchen cabinet door back in its hinges. Find the Whiskey bottle. Take a big breath and put a cold whiskey compress on your cheeks to disinfect. Check if your tetanos injection is still valid. Discard your frayed sweater and put on a new one.

Call the fire department to get the cat out of the tree. Make apologies to the neighbor who, while avoiding your cat, drove through his own fence. Take the last pill from the box.

Tape the two front legs of the animal together and tie it securely to the leg of the dining table. Take your heavy work gloves and put them on. Push the pill in and press a piece of meat behind it and don't be too careful. Then grab a glass of water. Hold the cat's head vertically and pour the water in to force him to swallow.

Take the last bit of Whiskey, ask your partner to drive you to the emergency room and let your fingers and forearm stick there and remove the remnants of the pill from your right eye.

Call the furniture store en route to order a new dining table.

Call the animal shelter for advice and ask at the pet store if they also have hamsters.",How do i give my cat a pill?,20

""Well,"" says the Abbott, ""we all love jokes. But we are a closed community, and so all the jokes are well-known by everyone. To save time, we wrote the jokes down and gave each of them a number. So if one of us says a number we all remember the relevant joke.""

""Could I have a go?"" asks the visitor and the Abbott says that will be fine.

So, a few minutes later the visitor stands up and says ""24"". But this time no-one laughs. All the monks look at him in silence and then go back to their meal.

The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.

The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.

The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!

The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head. “You’re really an a\*\*hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”",Two guys at a bar.,8

Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everybody knows Dave!,237

""I sort by smell, texture and feel."" says the guy.

""OK"", says the boss, ""let's see how you go.""

He sits the guy down in the warehouse and has the boys bring in several differently sized pieces of wood which he hands to the guy one after the other.

""That's easy!"", says the guy about the first piece, ""That's Sitka spruce, 2 by 4.""

""Ahh, trying to be tricky are you? Well, I'm not easily fooled, that's Brazilian mahogany, 1 by 1 square."" he says of the second piece.

This goes on for 20 minutes and no matter what they bring, he gets the wood type right.

Finally the boss has had enough and he steps out to reception where gets his wife to step out of her undies. He tells the guy that if he gets this one right, by smell alone, he's got the job.

The boss holds the panties close to the guy's nose and he recoils with a very puzzled look on his face. He's definitely stumped and asks the owner if he can have another smell.

The boss turns the panties around and let's him try again. Once more the guy looks puzzled and then he smiles knowingly.

The man thanks her, then makes his way down the hall to the third door on the right and goes in.  In the middle of room on the floor is a mattress, and on that mattress is a chicken.   

At first,  the man is grossed out.  ""This is disgusting,  I would never.""  But soon, his urges get the best him and he ends up having sex with the chicken.  He leaves the bordello with a smile and is surprised at how much he enjoyed himself.   

The next day, the man finds himself really very horny again, with even less money.   Still, he heads back to the bordello hoping to get lucky again. 

He walks in, goes to the nice lady at the front desk, and puts 3 wrinkly dollar bills on the counter.  ""Lady, this is all the money I got, but I really need some satisfaction, if you get my meaning.  What can you do for me?""

The nice lady says, ""You again, huh?"" she snatches money from the counter, ""Go down the hall, third door on your LEFT, you'll find what you need.""

The man thanks her, then makes his way down the hall to the third door on the left and goes in.

This room is set up as a theater, and there are several men jerking off to a video playing of a man having sex with an inflatable doll.  

Our hero sees this and exclaims in disgust,  ""This is terrible.   I can't get off on this.  This is some depraved shit.""

One of other patrons hears him and says, ""Aww, this is nothin'.  Yesterday, we seen some guy fuckin' a chicken!""","A man find himself feeling really, really, very horny but also short on money.",122

During their stay they encountered several tribes of natives. The members of those tribes all looked similar to each other, with one very noticeable exception: all males of one of the tribes were extremely well-endowed. Both being curious scientists in their hearts, Bill and Elon wondered why this is the case, so they decided to spend some of their holiday time on studying the tribe. After spending some time talking to the shaman of the tribe, they learned of a curious ritual each male that has reached puberty performed once a week: they caught a male duck and rubbed their penis on the duck's beak.

Surprised, Bill and Elon paid the locals to capture some of those ducks for them and they took the ducks to a laboratory. And behold: it turned out that the natives were right. The beaks of these ducks had a characteristic smell, and when the chemical molecules that produced the smell were extracted and purified, they really did work as a penis enlargement drug. The results were excellent: the drug was consistently showing significant penis growth rate in all tests on all subjects. Our two businessmen were besides themselves with delight. As soon as they returned from the vacation, they co-founded a new company that will bring this new drug to the market and make them billions of dollars while doing so.

The drug is coming out this week and it's sure to be a huge success. Not just because of its effects, but also because of the catchy ad campaign slogan both founders co-wrote:

""Bill musk elongates.""",A penis enlargement drug made of duck beaks.,3

He stumbles outside the room and sees broken glass, a broken lamp, mud (or vomit) in the carpet, half the clothes he was wearing the day before stinking of alcohol and cigarette laying in the floor... he has no idea what happened, so he calls for his son.

""where is your mom?"" He asks. 

""she went to the store to get a new door lock"" The kid answers.

""ok... do you know what happened yesterday?""

""i sure do"" says the kid; ""you came home at around 5am drunk off your mind, you parked the car in the front lawn, after doing a couple of *doughnuts* on the front lawn with the car, then, you couldnt fit the key on the front door, and started knocking the door really hard and yelling for us to open, waking the neighbors that where still not awake because of the car parking, but you didnt wait for us, so you ended up kicking open the door after failing to force your way in...""

""So, what happened then?"" asked the still hung over man.

""Me and mom reached you half way up the stairs and understood you couldnt be talked to, so we dragged you up the stairs, by then you where trying to undress yourself, but couldnt really do it. You only got half your shirt off so mom unbuttoned the rest and then reached for your pants...""
