She became very embarrassed over the phone and pleaded that she could never reveal her secret. I of course replied that I would not give her system access until she did.

After negotiating for several minutes she finally acquiesced but made me promise to never reveal her password meaning to any of her colleagues to which I gladly agreed.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.
I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together.
When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say,

post,4wr4xf,2qh72,jokes,false,1470675311,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4wr4xf/the_silent_debate/,self.jokes,,"Note: This is a joke best told in person by somebody who's not afraid to go all out with gesticulations and accents. 

The silent debate was a yearly event that was the Super Bowl of the intellectual world. It was watched live by tens of thousands, and broadcast on countless major networks. For near a decade, it had been won by Jean-Baptiste, the undisputed master of the silent debate. This year he was being challenged by a true dark horse, Joe from Brooklyn. 

The debate begins and a hush falls over the crowd. Jean-Baptiste opens by holding out a raised index finger, slowly moving it in front of him. Joe counters, doing the same with his middle and index fingers. Jean responds by repeating the gesture, this time with 3 fingers. Joe is the first to buck the trend, raising a fist in front of his face. Jean-Baptiste makes wide sweeping arcs in front of himself and to the side with his open palms. Joe grabs his right arm right around the crook of his elbow and violently thrusts his fist in front of himself again. Jean is in a tough spot, but confident. He has something incredibly profound, a move he has kept in his back pocket but never had to use up until this moment. He calmly raises his right hand and forms a circle with his thumb and forefinger. The crowd gasps, sure Joe is beat. Joe looks on, puts the backs of his hands against his cheek, and rapidly wriggles his fingers while his face jerks back and forth. Jean-Baptiste goes red in the face upon seeing this, and flees the stage. Joe has won.

After the debate reporters are everywhere taking statements from the competitors. One corners Jean-Baptiste and asks him what happened. ""Well,"" says Jean, ""I began by saying 'Singularity,' to which Joe said 'Duality.' I said 'Trinity,' and Joe said 'Power.' I tried to appeal to reason, and said 'Peace,' but he countered with 'Absolute Power.' I finally said 'Divinity.' Surely no man can argue against the divine! But he did that... thing, with such passion and self assurance, and I don't even know what he said. He counters me and I cannot even conceive of his argument. I am truly beat.""

The reporters are now whipped into a frenzy; they must know what it was that Joe said. They find him backstage, already celebrating with pounding music and copious amounts of alcohol. When asked about the debate, Joe says, ""Yeah alright. So this guy comes out and he says to me, he says 'I'm gonna stick my finger up your asshole.' I say 'Oh yeah? I'll stick two fingers up your asshole!' He says 'You do that and you'll be getting 3 fingers up your asshole.' I says 'Buddy, I will stick my whole damn fist up your asshole.' Now this guy says, 'Whoa whoa, back off. You can't stick your fist up my asshole.' I says 'Tough shit buddy, I'll stick my fist up your asshole all the way to my elbow.' And then he says, 'But my asshole is only *this big*' So I tells him, 'Then I guess we'll have to make it a little wider!'""",The Silent Debate,6

He swerved to avoid hitting the rabbit, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of the car and was hit.

 The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the rabbit. Much to his dismay, the rabbit was dead.
The driver felt so awful, he began to cry.

 A woman driving down the highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.

""I feel terrible,"" he explained, ""I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it.""
The woman told the man not to worry. She knew what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit.

Miraculously the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. Fifty yards away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved and hopped down the road, another 50 yards, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 yards.

The man was astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in the woman's spray can!!

He ran over to the woman and asked, ""What is in your spray can? What did you spray on that rabbit?""

Satan leads him to the first room and opens the door. In this room, there's a huge swimming pool. In it, Reagan is drowning. He goes down, then up, then down, then up, and he's gasping for air all the while.

'Oh, no,' says Bush. 'That's not for me, I'm a poor swimmer.'

Satan opens the second door. The room is full of rocks and they see Nixon trying to break up the rocks with a wooden hammer.

'Nah, I have problems with my shoulders and my back, that'd be such a painful thing to do day after day.'

So Satan opens the third door. In the room, they see Clinton lying on the floor, all tied up. Monica Lewinsky is lying on top of Clinton, giving him a blowjob. Bush stares at the scene with a wide smile and says:

Next Sunday, the priest decides to heed his suprior's advice. And indeed, after drinking with a full glass, he felt like he could speak in front of even thousands of people.

The next morning, he didn't remember that much from the previous day's events, but he was sure he wasn't nervous at all. When he got up, he noticed a letter from his superior on his nightstand. He opened it and started reading.

'Dear Brother,

1 - Next time, only have a few sips and don't down that drink at once.

2 - We don't put ice cubes and lime into the mass chalice.

'Sir, how old do you think I am?'

'Look, m'am, I'm over eighty-five, my sight isn't what it used to be, but I have an infallible technique to establish your age. If you'll allow me, I'll go under your bra and I'll be able to say exactly how old you are.'

The woman was definitely not expecting this, but she was really curious so she accepted. They hid behind some bushes and the old man put his hands under her bra. He went around the whole area, nicely and softly. He lifted her breasts, he cupped them, squeezed them a little bit. The woman grew impatient.

""\*\*Complete each of the bar's four **IMPOSSIBLE** challenges to win a round of **10** drinks each!\*\*  
Complete **ALL** four challenges at once and win...

###DRINKS FOR LIFE!!!  
^^^^^Inquire ^^^^^within ^^^^^for ^^^^^details.""

The drunk straightened up his nonexistent tie, licked his palm to slick back his hair, and walked right through the door, past the plethora of patrons, and straight up to the bar.

The bartender, who was busy cleaning glasses, took one look at the bum, and asked, ""So I take it you're here about the challenge?""

The bum nodded, hiccuped, and slurred out, ""Yesshurey, I shure am!""

The bartender rolled his eyes, then explained, ""Alright, each of the challenges nets you ten drinks. If you manage to do all four challenges before we close up for the night, you'll be swimming in more alcohol then you'll know what to do with. For the first challenge, you'll need to nail this railroad spike,"" as he picked up a 12-incher from behind the bar and placed it on top, ""into the sticking post in the men's room with any of the eggs from the pickle jar. After, you'll need to climb up to the roofline of this establishment. From there, you'll be pissing into one of our shotglasses filling it up to the brim. Then, there's Rocky, the rottweiler in the yard out back. You'll need to pull the thorn out of his paw, and he doesn't much like strangers. Finally, you'll be going upstairs where you'll find my grandmother, the most insatiable, randy woman in this town in the past sixty years. If you can give her the best fucking of her life, you'll win your prize.""

By this point, the entire bar establishment had gathered to see if the old coot will follow through with the challenges. He immediately snatched up the railroad spike, reached barehanded into the pickle jar to yank out an egg, and marched straight into the lavatory, where he's followed by a few male patrons to witness this act. The restroom erupted with cheers, hollers, and hoots interspersed with the old man's ""goddammit""s, ""shiiiit""s, and ""ah fucking hell""s. Eventually a unified cheer erupted within the small area of the bar and the old man walks out with one egg-covered, bloody stump of a hand and a smirk.

He marched back over to the bar, tapped the bartop, and said, ""My drinkssh, pleeash...""

The bartender poured out ten shots of the cheapest swill he carried and the drunk downed em as quickly as they're poured without crossing his eyes. He kept the final shotglass in hand as he made his way out the front door. A vast majority of the bar followed him out, starting up a rhythmic chant to keep him going. You could tell from within the bar that it must have been going well, since the rhythm of the chant picked up more and more after awhile and ended with another unified cheer.

The old drunk stumbled back in and, wordlessly, pointed his finger on top of the bar again. The bartender set up another ten shots and the drunk gulped down all ten. The entire bar was erupting with cheers at this point. The drunk then took a deep breath and barely kept himself upright as he veritably flopped out the back door, naturally followed by almost the entire bar at this point. However, once in the yard, instead of the usual cheers that occurred, there was a smattering of ""oooh""s and ""uuuuhhhh""s, interjected by occasional ""what the fuck""s. There could be heard between the reactions of the crowd the growls and snarls of a wild beast, followed by loud yelps and extremely loud whimpering. Eventually, hushed silence followed and some of the patrons preceded the stumbling, old drunk as they dove straight for restrooms, covering the vomit in their mouths.

The drunk, now covered in scrapes, scratches, and abrasions, pointed to the bar again as the bartender already began lining up glasses and shots for him to down. Once the last shot had been drunk, and everyone was certain the old man wouldn't keel over or pass out, he managed to half speak, half belch...

He's a delivery man for Dunkin' donuts, so his truck is filled with boxes of donuts of every kind. Glazed, old-fashioned, even apple fritters, you name it, he has it in his truck. Now this man is in a hurry, and he's driving pretty fast, about 60 mph. He's driving along, and he suddenly hits a bump. His truck jumps a little, but he's fine, still on the road. Then, he begins to speed up. He gets up to 80 mph, on this road just feet from a cliff. Then he hits a second bump. A little bit more of a jolt, but ultimately nothing to be concerned about. The man isn't scared at all, and gets his truck up to 100 mph. At this breakneck speed, he hits a third bump. This time, a donut flies out of his truck, off the cliff, and into the ocean below, where a fish eats it.

Joke 2: A man gets married to a beautiful wife, and for their honeymoon they decide to go on a cruise. During the cruise, the man is leaning against the railing thinking about how wonderful his life is. Unfortunately, the man had quickly developed a bad habit of twirling his wedding ring around his finger. While doing so, he accidentally knocks it off of his finger and into water. The man dejectedly explains to his wife what happened. She's pretty angry, so to make it up to her, he takes her to a really fancy restaurant after they dock. After long deliberation, the man orders the fish. The fish arrives, steaming and beautifully cooked. The man cuts into it, and is shocked at what is inside. He just can't believe what he sees.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.  The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”
The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”
The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.
The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.
He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.
Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”
The man is relieved to no end.
He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers.

'Gary, how the f*ck do you know so many influential people?'

Gary just shrugs.

'Well y'know, I even know the Pope.'

His boss goes pale, but doesn't believe him. Gary, to prove his claim, gets on a plane with his boss and they fly directly to Rome. At the Vatican, they stop right in front of St Peter's Basilica.

'I'll go in, and in five minutes I'll wave at you with the Pope from the balcony, alright?'

Five minutes pass. The boss looks up at the balcony and to his amazement Gary is really standing there next to the Pope. The boss simply faints. A Japanese group of tourists try to reanimate him. Once the boss wakes up, the Japanese tourists ask:

'What happened to you?'

The boss weakly waves towards the balcony.

'Look... there...'

The Japanese look up and one of them suddenly asks:

'Heeeey... who's that old white-clothed man next to Gary?'",Gary Smith,20

After some hesitation, the staff escorted the elderly woman to the president's office. The president asked how much money she wished to deposit in the bank.

'$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.

Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.

'Gambling' she muttered.

'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.

'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'

'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'

'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.

'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'

'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'

'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.

That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.

The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.

'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'

The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!

That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.

'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'

'Oh, nothing. Only that yesterday I bet him $100,000 that today I'd hold the president of the Canadian National Bank's balls in my hand.'",An elderly woman enters the Canadian National Bank with a bag full of money,8126

The Jews understandibly got really angry about this, so the Pope proclaimed that if a Jew could manage to beat him in a theological debate, they could stay.

The Jews chose their wisest rabbi for the religious debate against the Pope. To make it more interesting, the rabbi proposed to make speaking forbidden for the duration of the debate. The Pope accepted. On the big day, the Pope and the rabbi sat down at a table and the followers of both religions gathered around them.

First, the Pope raised three fingers. Then the rabbi raised one finger.

Next, the Pope drew a circle in the air while the rabbi pointed to the ground.

Then, the Pope took out the bread and the wine. The rabbi answered by taking out an apple.

The Pope, amazed, stood up from the table.

'I give up' he said. 'You're too wise for me, rabbi. You and your fellow Jews can stay.'

Later, the cardinals asked the Pope what he talked about with the rabbi.

'First, I raised three fingers to remind him of the Holy Trinity. But he raised one finger to remind me there's only one God in both our religions. After that, I drew a circle in the air to show him God was everywhere around us. But he pointed to the ground to show that God is right here with us. Then I took out the sacramental bread and wine to show him God absolves us from our sins. However, he took out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had an answer to everything, what could I possibly do?!'

At the same time, the Jews asked the same question from the rabbi.

'First, the Pope showed me we had three days to leave the city. But I made him understand that not even ONE Jew would leave. After that, he showed me around to say he'd cleanse the whole city from Jews. But I pointed to the ground, showing him that we'd stay right here.'

'And then?' asked the Jews.

The rabbi shrugged.

'I don't know. He took out his lunch, and so did I.'",Theological debate,785

Do you think I could stay the night?” The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.


The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.


Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.


The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”


The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”


The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”


The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”


The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”


The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door.


The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.


So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”


The man is relieved to no end. The monk unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.


But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery...,11

The offer is an honorable discharge and $1,000 for every inch between two points of their body of their choosing.

A Navy admiral takes this opportunity and heads into the medical office to have his two locations measured. He picks the tip of his big toe and the top of his forehead. The doctor measures 77 inches and off he goes to enjoy civilian life.

Next up is an Air Force general. He plans ahead a little better and raises his arm all the way up and stands of his toes and the doctor measures 99 inches. Out the door he goes nearly $100,000 richer and a civilian.

The last one to take the buy out is an Army General. The doctor asks him which two points he'd like measured and he replies;

""The tip of my penis to the base of my left testicle."" 

The doctor is a little taken aback at this and reminds the man that no matter how well hung he is, he's probably short changing himself. The general assures the doctor that he knows what he's doing and would like to proceed.

""Ok, suit yourself sir. Drop your pants."", says the doctor who kneels down with his measuring tape. 

""Wait a minute! Where the hell is your left testicle?!"", exclaims the shocked doctor.

Doing this made her cleavage show quite a bit and she really knew he would notice and say something.   Well, she walked out of the bathroom and her husband, who was already in bed reading a book, looked up at her and went right back to reading.  After a few minutes of trying to talk to him and him blowing her off she sternly asked him if he noticed anything different about her this evening.  He sighed, looked up at her and very casually said ""Yes, I noticed that your nightgown was on backwards"" and went back to his book.   This made her happier but she was still concerned as to why he didn't seem to care.  When she asked him what it was that made him notice the gown was on backwards (Completely expecting the exposed cleavage) he looked at her and said.

Then the fireman says' we have a three alarm, this is a third alarm fire' and the wife gets into it, they hit the bed and begin wild lovemaking.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

The most novice skier was getting frightened when the sun was going down and told them they had to fine a place to stay or they would all freeze to death. They kept looking for a suitable place to stay the night when they saw a warm cabin with its windows lit up down aways. When the reached the cabin They ran up to the only entrance and frantically banged on the door. 
  An old lady told them to stop their banging and she was on her way. When she opened the door the three men were greeted with a toothless smile of an old lady missing most of her hair. She asked the men what they were doing at her cabin in the middle of a blizzard. The novice skier said they got lost and needed a place to stay or they would all freeze to death. The lady pondered for a minute and told them they could stay on one condition. That they fucked her silly until she passed out. The most novice skier said hell to the no and waited for the other two to come to the same conclusion he did. The next skier thought for a moment and said he'll take his chances outside. The third skier waited almost two minutes before he said she'll have to time of her life that night. 
 The lady let him in and closed the door after him. She sat down on her sofa, spread her legs and lifted her dress. The unfortunate man was greeted with the smell of what he thought death would smell like. Yet he persevered and pulled down her panties. The sight was horrible. she had a scab covering her whole vagina. But this nasty skier didn't let that stand between him and a warm night. He opened her window peeled that scab off and threw it out the window and fucked her until she passed out. He quickly fell asleep and when he woke up he went outside and saw his two friends waiting for him. He was amazed how had they stayed alive he thought. They told him that they had started a fire to stay warm and ate the piece of pizza he threw out the window so they wouldn't starve. ",Some friends were skiing when a blizzard hit. (NSFW),0

After some supper they go up to bed, it's then the farmer explains they only have one bedroom and only one bed and that they'll bunk up together, the business man wants to stay in his car but the weather outside looks terrible so he gets into bed with them.

She explains nothing will wake hin if he's fast asleep and tells him to pull a hair from his ass crack to check he's sound asleep. The man does this and the farmer doesn't wake so they proceed to have the most passionate sex the business man has ever had.

 They go back to sleep but after a couple of hours the business man wakes again with another erection and the farmers wife teasing his todger. Again he pulls a hair from the farmers crack to check he's sound asleep and they proceed to have the most amazing sex. 

They go back to sleep after but before daybreak the business man is again woken by the farmers wife gently exciting his major. So the business tugs out one of the farmers arse hairs to check he's asleep. But this time the farmer wakes and turns to the business man and says ""Look mister!

that the Horse could no longer believe

an obviously impossible leap of logic,
absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.

nor the Bartender,
nor the bar itself can be said to exist,
then why should he ask,
how could he ask,
""why the long face?""

and that which has no meaning cannot be stated.

but by fundamental doubt that he was ever alive,

post,4we2em,2qh72,jokes,false,1470451946,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4we2em/three_brothers_longed_for_wealth_and_fame/,self.jokes,,"So they put together an expedition to track down the lost treasures of Egypt. They weren't particularly successful, but they stumbled on the a tomb and decided to check it out, even though it wasn't on their list. Inside, there were three passageways with an inscription above each one. 

""He who enters shall die a watery death"" read the first.

""He who enters shall die a fiery death"" read the second.

""He who enters shall die a mysterious death"" read the third.

The eldest brother had been a collegiate so he chose the first. The middle brother was a volunteer firefighter and chose the second. The youngest brother, being wholly unremarkable, took the third without complaint.

They decided to go one at a time, so as to not be all lost at once should the inscriptions prove truthful. The eldest entered walked down the hallway and was greeted by stairs that descended into darkness. He lit his torch and walked down. At the bottom, it opened up to a room filled with an amount of gold and gems he had not thought was possible. He emptied his pack and started stuffing it with gold, but the he heard a rush of air and water and the room began flooding. He scrambled, still trying to grab as much as he could carry. By the time he reached the stairs the water was above his head, running out of air, and the gold kept him from rising to the surface for air. He scrambled along the floor as fast as he could and made it to the top of the stairs where he broke the surface and gasped for air.

Back at the entrance he greeted his brothers, told his tale, and displayed his spoils. The middle brother couldn't resist such temptation and decided he would risk it as well. The room at the bottom of his stairs was similarly splendorous, and as he grabbed what he could carry he felt the temperature rise. Lava started seeping in through holes in the wall faster than he'd ever seen. As he reached the stairs, the lava flow was mere inches behind him. However, he made it safely back to his brothers, the lava stopping at the top of the stairs just as the water did.

The youngest couldn't bear the shame of being outdone by his older brothers, so he too decided to enter his hallway. He had thought his brothers were telling tall tales when they had described the treasures that had awaited them, but he was surprised to see they were not. He nervously filled his bag, having no idea what might try to kill him, but there was nothing. He filled his pack, and walked back to his brothers who were none too happy about who easy he'd had it.

That being enough adventure for the three brothers, they returned home and cashed in their treasures. They had more money than any of them could spend. The eldest brother bought a rooftop suite, complete with a beautiful garden. The middle brother bought a mansion and hired staff to tend to his every need. The youngest bought a 3 bedroom house in the suburbs. Because he was wholly unremarkable.

Years went by and the brothers forgot the omens. Until one day, the eldest was hosting a party, got outrageously drunk, and while he was attempting to pee in his garden he tripped and drowned in his koi pond. The two remaining brothers chalked it up to bad luck. The eldest had always partied too hard. So they went on with their lives, none the wiser as to the significance of the eldest's watery death. 

Months go by and the middle brother, who had turned into a bit of a gourmet, was having a bananas foster flambéed tableside. As the flames roared, one of the waitstaff slipped in some water on the floor and fell into the portable stove, sending it, the flaming bananas foster, and the bottle of whiskey she'd been carrying onto the brother who burst into flames.

At the funeral the youngest, and now sole, brother contemplated his brothers' misfortune. He remembered the omens and decided to take precautions. 

He built an underground fortress. Outfitted it with water pumps meant to keep battleships aflot, the worlds most advance fire suppression systems, surveillance that would thwart Tom Cruise, and the best private security he could buy. Months went by, he even began to feel safe again. 

Then, the alarms went off. He turned on the security feed in his room and saw guards running as fast as their legs could carry them. He heard the BOOM BOOM BOOM of something large approaching, but the feed cut out before it appeared on screen. The booms continued, never stopping, never slowing, even as the gun fire and explosions from his security teams were silenced. He peeked through the window in his door, hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever was attacking him.

A great stone coffin descended down the stairs. The brother slammed the window shut, grabbed his gun, and pulled a pin from a grenade he kept at his bedside. The booms got louder until they reached his door and with a single almighty crash the 2000 lb metal door was sent flying across the room. The brother tossed the grenade into the hallway and dove into his bathroom. It didn't stop the coffin, and it lurched closer and closer. He emptied his clip at it, and accomplishing nothing he began throwing everything within reach in pure desperation. Having exhausted his improvised ammo, he grabbed the very last thing he could find, a bottle of Nyquil in his medicine cabinet, and threw it with all his might. The bottle shattered on the approaching obelisk, and finally, blessedly the coffin stopped.",Three brothers longed for wealth and fame,1

He was chatting to the bartender when he spied an old Native American man sitting in the corner. He had tribal gear on, long white plaits, wrinkled face.

""Who's he?"" asked the Liverpudlian.

""That's the Memory Man."" said the bartender. ""He knows everything, remembers everything. He can remember every face he's ever seen. He can remember any fact he hears or reads. Go and try him out.""

So the Liverpudlian goes over, and thinking he won't know about English football, asks ""Who won the 1965 FA Cup Final?"".

""Liverpool"" replies the Memory Man.

""Who did they beat?""

""Leeds"" was the instant reply.

""And the score?""

""2-1."" 

""Who scored the winning goal?"" 

""Ian St. John"" said the old man, without a hint of hesitation.

The Liverpudlian was knocked out by this and told everyone back home about the Memory Man when he got back. 

A few years later he went back to the USA and tried to find the impressive Memory Man. Eventually he found the bar and sitting in the same seat was the old Native American, only this time he was older and even more wrinkled. 

The Liverpudlian approached him with the greeting ""How"".

He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, 'What may we do for you my son?' 

He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly doing business....' 

'Very well my son. Please follow me.' He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.' 

He does so and another nun in a long habit, holding a tin cup answers the door... This nun instructs, 'Please place $100 in the cup then go through the large wooden door at the end of the hallway.' 

He puts $100 in the cup, eagerly trots down the hall and slips through the door pulling it shut behind him. 

The door locks, and he finds himself back in the parking lot facing another sign:
