I didn't know how

But I tried my best

post,3stt2t,2qh72,jokes,false,1447538524,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3stt2t/tim_the_conductor/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time there was a train conductor named Tim. Tim greatly enjoyed conducting his train around every day, and even though he had relatively poor pay, all was well in Tim's world. There was only one issue; Tim was a flat out *awful* conductor. He reduced the overall efficiency of all of the trains nearly every day by screwing up his timing, causing other trains to have to wait on him. 

Tim's conducting got worse and worse as time went on. One day, Tim decided to try and eat his lunch while doing his job. Seeing as he could hardly work while focused, this was a terrible idea, but Tim decided to do it anyway. This was a mistake. Another train, hurtling at his train at great speed, was scheduled to pass through the area that Tim was currently in. It was Tim's responsibility to yield to the other train to prevent a crash. Unbeknownst to the other conductor, Tim was unaware that the other train was coming, so Tim plowed on in his train, not a care in the world. Biting into the sandwich his wife had packed, Tim's eyes closed to savor the taste. The other train began to cross in front of him, but seeing as Tim's eyes were closed, Tim did not see the train, and didn't stop. The two collided, the screeching of metal against metal combined with the crashing as the two trains were flung off of their tracks.

Tim was fired on the spot. Devastated, Tim went home to his wife. Her kind, loving smile upon seeing him made his insides melt, and it was in that moment Tim realized he couldn't bear to break the news to her. Acting as though nothing was wrong, Tim left the next day as if going to work, but instead drank at a nearby pub the entire day. This continued for weeks until Tim ran out of money. Crushed and guilty, Tim went home again and told his wife everything, begging for her forgiveness.

She left him.

Tim had nothing left to live for, and considered taking his own life. While mulling it over, a thought struck him; if the other conductor had stopped *his* train, none of this would have happened. In Tim's deluded mind, this though evolved into another: revenge. 

Tim tracked down the other conductor. In the dead of night, Tim snuck into the poor mans house. The crack of a gunshot echoed through the streets as Tim shot the man. The police found Tim lying on top of the dead man, laughing maniacally. After a short trial, Tim was sentenced to death.

Tim looked blankly foreword as he was strapped in an electric chair. The executioner turned a switch, and a leathal shock pulsed through the chair. Miraculously, Tim survived. The baffled executioner tried again and again to execute Tim, but was unsuccessful. Scientist were brought in to try and figure out what was causing this strange phenomenon, but not a single one could find the truth. Eventually, the scientists became desparate enough to ask Tim if he understood why the chair could not kill him. Through a haze of madness, inspiration struck Tim. He look up at the scientist and said: 

""Well, I never was a very good conductor.""",Tim the Conductor,18

They are literally just doing exactly what their book says to do. When acts of violence occur we call it radical islam. If I sold my house and gave all the money to the poor would that be radical christianity? I would just be doing what the bible says to do. Is that really that radical? list of quotes from the koran to back this up.
2.190] ...fight in the way of Allah with those who fight with you...[2.191] And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.
reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their Lord [meaning they are enjoying their 72 virgins in heaven]; they fight in Allah's way, so they slay and are slain...
.when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates...(as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah...
Just goggle it and you will find I wish I was kidding, but literally hundreds more references to war in the koran. I am all for religious freedom, but does that really mean we can't have an open critique of this religion. It seems pretty much to be the worst religion in history. I can not think of single place that has a large percentage of muslims, and also has peace. Why because what the koran teaches is that war is not only acceptable, but an important part of getting to heaven. Charles Mason listened to The Beatles song Helter Skelter and thought, ""ohh, I get it Paul is telling me that I have to start a race war."" He was clearly insane. That song is just a bunch of gibberish. I don't think that ISIS and Al Qaeda are crazy. They are doing literally exactly what the koran says. Then we act surprised that they are doing it. Why?",Islam a frank discussion,0

Last month, Wits University and RAU scientists released the results of a recent analysis that revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. 

Men should take a concerned look at their beer consumption. 

The theory is that beer contains female hormones (hops contain Phytoestrogens) and that by drinking enough beer, men turn into women . 

To test the theory, 100 men drank 7 pints of beer each within a 1 hour period. 


It was then observed that 100% of the test subjects : 
1) Argued over nothing. 
2) Refused to apologize when obviously wrong. 
3) Gained weight. 
4) Talked excessively without making sense. 
5) Became overly emotional 
6) Couldn't drive. 
7) Failed to think rationally. 


No further testing was considered necessary.

Jan arrives first, wearing beige Versace. She orders a bottle of Pinot Grigio.

Sue arrives shortly afterward, in gray Chanel. After the required ritualized kisses she joins Jan in a glass of wine.

Then Mary walks in, wearing a faded old tee-shirt, blue jeans and boots. She too shares the wine.

Jan explains that after leaving high school and graduating from Princeton in Classics, she met and married Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter. Timothy is a partner in one of New York's leading law firms. They live in a 4000 sq ft co-op on Fifth Avenue, where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They have a second home in Phoenix .

Sue relates that she graduated from Harvard Med School and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a leading Wall Street investment banker. They summer in Southampton on Long Island and have a third home in Naples, Florida.

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Jim. They run a tropical bird park in Colorado and grow their own vegetables. Jim can stand five parrots, side by side, on his dick.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a cashier at WalMart. They live in a small apartment in Brooklyn and have a travel trailer parked at a nearby storage facility.

Sue, chastened and encouraged by her old friend's honesty, explains that she and Clive are both nurses' aides in a retirement home. They live in Jersey City and take vacation trips to Alabama and Virginia, usually camping.

""Doctor,"" he says, ""I'm not happy with the state of my sex life, and I want to you to castrate me today.""

The doctor is shocked and asks, ""Oh my... Okay, have you thought about this decision and what it will mean for you?""

With some irritation, the CEO replies, ""Of course I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm the CEO of a multi-billion dollar business. I flew my personal jet here just so I could get the best doctor in the business to do this operation. I know what I want, I'm confident in my decisions, and I never look back.""

""Okay,"" says the doctor, ""I just want you to be 100% sure of your decision to cut off your...""

Visibly annoyed, the CEO interrupts the doctor by pulling out his pocketbook, pulling out a stack of $100 bills, and  a credit card. ""Here is $1000 cash for your trouble, and a no-limit credit card to get this done. I want to be back in my mansion by dinner time.""

Silently the doctor gathers up the money, and leads the CEO to the hospital's best private suite, and starts prepping him for surgery.

A few hours later, the CEO wakes up, operation completed. He decides to stretch his legs and take a walk around in the hallway. He has to walk with a wide bow-legged gait to avoid jostling the massive pile of bandages around his very sore genitals. 

After a few minutes, he spots another patient walking around the hall with the same posture. The CEO smiles and says, ""Looks like we had the same surgery. I'm sure it'll make your night life a bit more exciting as well.""

The other man sheepishly grins and replies, ""Yeah, finally got circumcised after 35 years. Hope my wife likes it better this way.""

A horrified expressions crosses the CEO's face. In a low whisper he says, ""Oh shit. That's the word.""",You're going to need more of that confidence now.,8

Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

Noah stepped off the Ark, announcing to all the animals, ""go now from the ark, go forth! Be fruitful multiply!""
Under Noah's command, the animals left the ark two by two in their pairs, and did which Noah commanded.
Many months passed, and upon the landscape were many horses, many birds, many rabbits, foxes, hares, all which crawled, flew and galloped. But Noah saw that something was not right. Noah saw two snakes within a tree, and only two snakes. They were both on opposite branches, and looked somewhat disconnected from each other. 
Noah approached the pair on snakes and asked ""what is wrong, snakes? Why have you not multiplied, as I commanded?""
Having heard this, the snakes responded in unison ""you must cut down this tree if we are to be fruitful. Please cut down this tree and leave it on the ground.""
Noah, confused, cuts down the large oak tree within which the snakes had been curled around. Having cut down the tree Noah left, hoping to return to a multitude of snakes.
It took many weeks upon months, but eventually the snakes produced a small number of young. The snakes requested to Noah that they cut down more trees. Noah obliged. After many trees were cut down, Noah asked the snakes in bewilderment, ""snakes, why is it that you need to have trees be cut down to produce children? I ask you to go forth and multiply, but you have me cutting down trees!""
The snakes look at each other, and reply ""we need you to cut down trees for us to be both fruitful and to multiply.""
Noah replies ""but why is it so I am cutting down precious trees for you to produce young?""
One of the snakes pulls Noah aside and whispers to him ""Noah, we respect you, but it is an embarrassing topic to talk about our sexual behaviour.""
""All I ask if the reason why you have me cutting down trees, snake!""

post,3sjjkx,2qh72,jokes,false,1447342226,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3sjjkx/the_boy_with_the_25_inches_long_penis/,self.jokes,,"The boy with the 25 inches long penis decided that he had had way too much. He was now fed up of being the subject of constant jokes of his friends, relatives and many-a-times, complete strangers.  
  
There was a time when he was proud of his unusually long penis, thinking of it as an indicator of much masculinity. But that was few years ago. He had heard that most women liked it big, and was excited for his first time, but was severely disappointed when his then girlfriend had been so terrified after unzipping his pants, that she had straightway declined to even touch it. He had now come to realize that there is such a thing as a too large penis.  
  
So now, the boy, deciding that he had had enough, packed his bags and set out on a journey to find a way to reduce the size of his penis. After months of wandering around and seeking for a solution to his problem, he was told of a wise man who could most definitely solve his problem because, the legend said, the wise man had never ever failed to that day.  
  
After a long and an arduous journey, he found the man he was looking for. The wise man heard his tale and gave him the directions to a lake. He told the boy that on reaching the lake, he was to raise his voice and say his name. If he was lucky he would be answered by a mermaid. He was to ask the mermaid to marry him. That, according to the wise man, would solve his problems.  
  
The boy followed the path the wise man had given him and in a few days, he reached the lake. Quite a few times, he called his name loudly over the silence. Nothing happened. Just when he was disappointed, and thought that his entire journey had been in vain, a beautiful mermaid appeared out of the water and sat on the stone at the edge of the lake.  
  
Smiling, the mermaid asked, ""How may I help you, human?""  
  
Excited, the boy hurriedly asked her that what he was supposed to ask, ""O dear mermaid, will you marry me?""  
  
The mermaid, still smiling, simply said, ""No.""  
  
Suddenly, the boy's penis was reduced from 25 inches to 20 inches. Tears of happiness welled through his eyes. But even through this intense happiness, the boy found himself thinking, 20 inches is better than 25, but 15 would be even great.  
  
Thus, he asked the mermaid again, ""Will you marry me?""  
  
The mermaid's smile faded a little, but even so, she replied curtly, ""No.""  
  
The boy's penis reduced from 20 inches to 15 inches. Now, again, he thought, 15 inches is better still, but a 10 inches penis would be ideal. A 10 inches penis would be perfect.  
  
Thus, he asked the mermaid again, ""Will you marry me?""  
  
The mermaid, now visibly frowning, and clearly annoyed, replied in an irritated voice, ""How many times do I have to say that to you?! No! No! No!""",The boy with the 25 inches long penis ...,333

The man was puzzled and was looking all around to find who said it. No one was near him. A few minutes later, he heard the same voice whisper again, "" you are so well dressed"". Again the man looked around; no one there. He was beginning to feel uncomfortable. 

Once more, the voice returned. "" do you work out, because you look like you work out.""

The man, at this point a little freaked out, waived down an attendant who had started beverage orders up front. The attendant came to the man and the man told him what was going on.

Being a little large, and not very bright, she didn't realize she was pregnant until she was very far along. In a panic she went to the doctor and said, ""What should we do?""

The doctor came up with a brilliant plan. A priest was just about to go into surgery for a stomach problem at their hospital, so he rearranged things to have him and the nurse do the operation. He delivered the baby by c-section, took care of the priest's stomach problem, quietly made arrangements for the nurse to recover at her home ... and proclaimed a miracle: the priest hadn't actually had a stomach problem ... he'd been pregnant! He just delivered a healthy baby boy!

Amazingly, everyone believed it, including the priest. He took the boy home from the hospital, and raised it as his own. As the boy grew up, the priest wouldn't tell him about his origin. Whenever the boy asked, ""Who's my father?"" the priest said, ""I'll let you know when you are 16.""

When the boy turned 16, the priest finally told him the story. He told about how he'd gone into the hospital, and the boy had been miraculously born into the world. The boy said, ""Wow ... so you really are my father!""

The priest said, ""Well actually, I'm your mother. The arch-bishop ... he's really your father.""",A miracle birth,121

post,3sfscb,2qh72,jokes,false,1447268502,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3sfscb/the_miller_is_one_drunk_motherfucker/,self.jokes,,"Okay so first off, a little backstory

there’s all these dudes and they are riding horses and shit

they are in england and they are trying to get to canterbury

cause that is where the party is at

or where the cathedral is at

or some kind of sacred statue at least

look WHATEVER

the point is there are a bunch of dudes and chicks on horses

and they get pretty bored because horses are slow

so this one guy

who is an inkeeper normally

is like GUYS

GUYS

making people less bored is what I DO

here’s the plan:

we’re gonna have a storytelling contest

and whoever tells the raddest story is going to get $$$$$$$$

so first up let’s hear a story from THIS KNIGHT I FOUND

and the knight is like SHIT YEAH BITCHES

and he tells a story

and maybe I will tell you that story some time

because it is pretty good in its own (boring boring) way

but for now we’ve got bigger fish to fry

cause see

after the knight finishes telling his story

the innkeeper is like GREAT STORY BRO

MAN

I WAS MOVED TO TEARS

OKAY UP NEXT LET’S HEAR A STORY FROM THIS NOBLE MONK OVER HERE

but that’s when shit goes haywire

cause there’s this miller riding with them

and he is TRASHED

it’s like 2PM and this guy is like falling off his horse

and he’s like HEY

INKEEPER

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU

SEEMS TO ME

YOU’RE JUST PICKING ALL THE RICH FANCY POPULAR DUDES

TO TELL ALL THEIR RICH FANCY POPULAR TALES

AND I MAY BE DRUNK

BUT I’M SURE AS HELL NOT FANCY OR POPULAR

SO GATHER ROUND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

LET ME TELL YOU A STORY

ABOUT BUTTS

and the Innkeeper is like whoa now

slow your roll there drunky mcdrunkenpants

and the Miller is like IF I’M SO DRUNK HOW COME YOU DON’T LOOK FUCKABLE YET

THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS

REASON ONE: I’M NOT DRUNK

IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD LET ME TELL MY STORY

REASON TWO: YOU’RE JUST REAAAAAAALLY UGLY

AND NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE ORDERS FROM UGLY PEOPLE

SO I SHOULD STILL TELL MY STORY

SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO

HERE IS MY STORY ABOUT BUTTS AND SEX AND CARPENTERS



now guys

before we begin this story

let me just remind you

that I am only a storyteller here

not even a full-on storyteller

a story RE-teller

so whatever the miller is about to say

it’s totally not my responsibility

this is his drunk-ass talking

filtered through the horndog sensibilites of Geoffrey Chaucer

and I will not hear any complaints

or god help me I am turning this myth around and we are going home




(I’m going to put this all in quotation marks so yall don’t forget)

""Okay so there’s this carpenter

his name is John

he’s a big jerk and also dumb

also old and gross

but he runs a pretty sweet motel

and also he has a REALLY HOT WIFE

guys

GUYS

his wife is so hot

I would eat pudding off her ass

STRAIGHT UP I WOULD

DON’T TEST ME

FIND ME AN ASS I WOULDN’T EAT PUDDING OFF OF

AND I CAN ASSURE YOU

THAT ASS WILL HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON THE ASS OF THIS WOMAN 

IN THE STORY I AM TELLING

her name is Allison by the way

and she has a nasty habit of eyefucking the SHIT

out of every man, woman and child in the vicinity

and what the fuck is this old guy doing getting married to this fine piece of ass?

can you spell Gold-digger?

cause I can’t

I’m way too drunk and I think I just pooped a little




SO ANYWAY

there’s also this dude living in the motel

his name is Nicholas

“Handy” Nicholas

“Handy” as in “Handy-man”

like the handy-men that are in all those pornos

he’s a scholar

A SCHOLAR OF POON, THAT IS

but also a regular scholar

he’s a pretty smart dude




so ONE DAY

while John the carpenter is out buying wood or something

Handy Nicholas just walks right up to Allison

grabs her on the vag

and is like hey baby howsabout you and me conjugate sexwise

if you know what I mean

and Allison is like WAIT NO

I’VE GOT A HUSBAND OR SOMETHING

also I’m not entirely sure what you mean by conjugate sexwise

and Nicholas is like well that’s all well and good

but I notice you have yet to remove my hand from your vagina

and Allison is like truuuuuuuue

then they bang

but halfway through banging Allison is like WAIT

I STILL HAVE A HUSBAND OR SOMETHING

WHAT IF HE FINDS OUT

and Nicholas is like cool it baby

what kind of poon scholar would I be

if I couldn’t outwit some dumbass carpenter?

look I have a plan

and step one of that plan

is for you to stop blueing my balls

and back that ass up

SEXWISE

so when John gets home

he finds that Handsy Nicholas has locked himself in his own room

along with his Titstrolabe and his Poon Sextant

and proceeds to just sit in there

FOR DAYS

gawping at the ceiling

until John finally freaks the fuck out

because shit man

he doesn’t want another dead body in his motel

so he has his house dude bust down the door

and then Nicholas is like JOHN

THANK GOD YOU’VE ARRIVED

I’VE HAD A VISION

A VISION

FROM GODDDDDDD

but listen dude

you can’t tell ANYONE ELSE about this vision

this is a you and me only vision

SO OKAY

VISION TIME

GET READY

alright so you’ve heard about Noah, right?

what if I told you

you were about to star in NOAH 2:

TURBO EDITION

and John is like holy shit YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

and Nicholas is like okay guy

here’s what I need you to do

I need you to go out and buy three feed tubs

like for feed

for animals

and I want you to hang them from your ceiling by ropes

and I want you to stuff them full of delicious food

and then you and me and your wife will lie in the feed tubs

and you have to lie as far away from your wife as possible

because god doesn’t want your dick anywhere near her puddinglicious ass

during the storm, I mean

you can thwap all over that shit later

MAYBE

but anyway yeah

then get an axe so you can cut all the ropes when I give the signal

and we will all drop into the water

and float away to safety

and everyone else will DROWN and DIE

and then we’ll all be floating on top of the water

and I’ll be like HEY JOHN IT’S GREAT TO BE ALIVE, HUH?

and you’ll be like HEY NICHOLAS

I CAN TOTALLY SEE YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT IS DAY TIME AND THIS PLAN IS FOOLPROOF

sound good?

and the Carpenter is like THAT SOUNDS GREAT AND ALSO TOTALLY BELIEVABLE

carpenters: SOOOOO DUMB AM I RIGHT

so John goes around and sets up all this dumb stuff that is super dumb
and then that night he and his wife and Nicholas all climb into the tubs
like GOODNIGHT GUYS

LET’S ALL PRAY BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL THING THAT IS HAPPENING

and then while John is praying

Allison and Nicholas climb out of the tubs

sneak inside

and FUUUUUUUUUCK




but guys

guys

this is where it gets REALLY GREAT

cause there’s this other scholar dude

his name is Absalon

and this asshole thinks he’s SO DAMN PRETTY

you know the type

he’s the guy with the van halen hair

and he plays guitar

and every time a religious holiday rolls around

he is the dude carrying the censer

which is a big mace full of incense

that he uses to go into hot chick’s houses

and bathe them with sweet-smelling smoke

seriously

this guy had to join the church to come up with an excuse to fondle women

how fucked up is that?

also

he is CONSTANTLY going into bars

and playing his fucking guitar to try and get with the waitresses

and despite that

he’s a real squeamish dude

who is TERRIFIED of farts

man I bet THAT won’t come into play at all right?




but so obviously Absalon is hot on Allison

and when he hears a rumor circulating around town

that no one has seen John all day

(cause john is in his shed building his dumbass contraption)

and he’s like SWEET

NOW’S MY CHANCE

so he waits til like 5AM

and he goes over to Allison’s window

and he starts serenading the FUCK out of that window

and Allison goes over to the window like FUCK BALLS WHAT DO YOU WANT

and Absalon is like I WANT YOUR BODY ALL OVER MY BODY

and Allison is like EW NO

I DON’T WANT YOUR VAN-HALEN-LOOKIN’ ASS ANYWHERE NEAR MY ASS

HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN MY ASS

PEOPLE HAVE OFFERED TO PAY ME MONEY

TO EAT PUDDING OFF OF IT

PUDDING, OK

and Absalon is like OKAY FINE

WELL CAN I AT LEAST GET A KISS?

and Allison is like WILL YOU GO THE FUCK HOME?

and Absalon is like OK SURE

so he busts out a ladder he brought specifically for this purpose

and he climbs up to the window

and it’s really dark, you gotta understand

so he gets up there and he puckers his lips

and Allison proceeds to stick her ASS out the window

and Absalon starts making out with her pungent hole

and then he’s like hey wait a second

women don’t have … beards

AW SHIT

and Allison is like TEE HEE

and then slams the window in his face

and goes back to banging Nicholas

so now Absalon is FURIOUS

like, real furious

this is dangerous

this is a dangerous game now

he’s ready to KILL someone

or at least seriously maim them

cause see what he does

is he goes over to this blacksmith’s place, right

and the blacksmith is like yo Absalon

what’s your van-halen-lookin’ ass doing in here at 5 o’clock in the damn morning?

and Absalon is like NO TIME TO EXPLAIN

LET ME BORROW YOUR RED HOT IRON REAL QUICK

and then he just grabs that shit and runs out of the store

and he goes back to Allison’s window

and he’s like HEY

HEY

OPEN THE FUCK UP

I BROUGHT YOU MY GRANDMA’S RING

I WILL TRADE IT WITH YOUR TAWDRY SELF IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE KISSES

and this time it’s Nicholas who hears him

cause see he just got up to take a piss

so he makes his voice all high and he goes like COMING, HONEY

and he goes over to the window

and he sticks his narrow scholar ass out the window

and Absolon climbs all the way up there

and Nicholas rips the NASTIEST FUCKING FART

like BLURRRTTTTTTTTTTTTT

and Absolon is almost blown off the damn ladder

[THIS IS LITERATURE GUYS. THIS IS FUCKING LITERATURE]

but he’s got his red hot iron ready this time

and he just jabs Handsy Nick right in his flapping asshole

and Nick’s taint catches on fire

and he runs into the house like WATER

WATER

HOLY SHIT

WATER

and John

who is still in the shed waiting for judgement day

hears Nick yelling and is like WATER?

HOLY SHIT THE FLOOD HAS COME

and he takes the axe

and severs the ropes

and plummets to the floor and breaks his arm

and the whole town shows up

and Nicholas is like hey guys

look at dumbass John the Carpenter

he thought there was going to be some kind of biblical flood

he was trying to make me and his wife go along with it

but luckily we were too busy banging or WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

and everyone makes fun of john forever

although I think he still stays married to Allison

so I don’t know what Nicholas got out of this whole thing

other than a scorched asshole




but uh, okay

so the moral of the story?

well the moral of the story is that hot chicks make terrible wives

and scholars make terrible friends

so maybe you’re better off just being gay

because at least then it’s not a TOTAL loss
if you find yourself making out with some dude’s asshole at 5:00 in the morning

post,3se7ln,2qh72,jokes,false,1447240251,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3se7ln/wish_i_could_meet_johnny_once/,self.jokes,,"Little Johnny was 12 years old and like other boys his age, rather curious, he had been hearing quite a bit about “courting” from the older boys and wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his questions to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.

“Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except, he’s not as smart as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been cold, because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got worse, and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I knew it was a fever because sis told him she was really hot.

Finally, I found what was making them so sick…. a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow… it jumped out of his pants and stood there, about ten inches long. Honest. anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away.

When sis saw it, she got really scared… her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she’s ever seen; I should tell her about the one down at the lake! Anyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting it’s head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit her back. Sis then grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel’s head to keep it from biting again.

Sis then laid back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on its head, he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. After a while, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because it just hung there, limp and some of its insides was hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired form the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn’t dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats….they have nine lives or something.

This time, sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After a 36 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead because i saw sis boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet”. By this time, Johnny’s mother had passed out cold.",Wish i could meet Johnny once.,1

Then it is time to pay and instead of giving three $1 dollar bills to the bartender the guy throws 30 dimes behind the counter.

The bartender is pissed and is on his hands and knees collecting change as the guy leaves.

The next day the man is back and he comes in waiving a $3 dollar bill.

The bartender thinks, ""Okay, business is business,"" and lets him in. Again, the beer is kind of warm, but the guy doesn't say anything.

Comes time to pay, the man gives him the $5 note.

The bartender goes to the register to get the change, but instead of taking out two $1 dollar bills, he takes out 20 dimes and throws them all around the entire pub. The bartender says, ""There is your f*cking change!""

The corn flake was sad, so he looked online to see how he could get frosted. There was a frosting machine in his town, but it was pretty expensive. So he worked and worked to afford the frosting. After 6 months he had enough spare change to be able to get half frosted. He went to the place in town to get frosted and had it done. He was only half frosted, but the next company party he went to the other corn flake and tried to talk to her. Again, she said ""I said, I only talk to fully frosted corn flakes. Go away."" So again, for 6 months he worked hard at his Walmart job. Then he could afford full frosting. So he went to the frost machine and had it done. He was a glorious fully frosted corn flake then. At the company party he found the girl and again, tried to talk to her.  She said ""Oh, hello Mr. Frosty. You look nice and frosty today."" The corn flake replied ""Hey. Can I get you anything to drink? Maybe a water?""
""Sure"" she said. so he went to find the line for the water. He came back moments later, saying ""They're out of water. Anything else?""
""I dont know, maybe some orange juice?"" she said. So he went to find the orange juice. But the line was too long. ""Anything else I can get you?"" He said to her. ""Can I have some fruit punch?"" She asked. So he went to find the fruit punch. But then he realized....

The woman then started some knitting and all the man could hear while he was trying to sleep was the incessant clicking of her knitting needles. After a while, he sits back up and says to the woman, ""Could you stop that noise, can't you see I'm trying to sleep?"" ""It's got nothing to do with you,"" replies the old woman, ""I've paid my fare and I'll do what I want on this train.""
