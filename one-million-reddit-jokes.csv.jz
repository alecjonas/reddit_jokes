'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word. As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation. He leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word.

High and outside again. Ball two. 

The pitcher grabs a rosin bag and flips it around in his hand. He wipes the sweat from his brow and mumbles to himself to get it together. He throws the next pitch. 

He over compensates on a sinker. It dips low and inside and crashes hard into Diego's leg. David Stacks is up to bat next and he immediately springs forward to rush towards his teammate. 

Before the ball can even come to rest on the ground Diego is in a heap on the dirt clutching his knee. The trainers rush out and before long they confirm that he can't continue. The GM sends in a pinch hitter to face the pitcher while David continues to warm up in the on deck circle. 

The broadcast feed cuts to an image of Diego in the back with trainers surrounding him and icing down his knee. The commentator reports the action.

Suzie stood and walked to the podium.

She said, “Two months ago, my husband, Phil, had a terrible bicycle accident and his scrotum was crushed.”

There was a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation.

“Phil was unable to hold me or the children,” she went on, “and every move caused him terrible pain.  We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and they were able to reconstruct the crushed remnants of Phil’s scrotum, using wire to reinforce and shape it.”

The men in the congregation cringed and squirmed uncomfortably.

“Now,” she announced in a quivering voice, “thank the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.”

All the men sighed with relief.  

The pastor rose and asked if anyone else had something to say.

A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium.

He said, “I’m Phil.”

The entire congregation held its breath.

“I just want to tell my wife the word is sternum.”

When she returned to her car, she was horrified to discover that she had locked her keys inside.  She searched her pockets but found nothing to help; no keys; no phone.  And not one car had passed along this quiet highway during the 15 minutes that she had pulled over.

Eventually, once she had calmed down, she prayed to the Lord for help.  And five minutes later, she heard a loud vehicle, and looked up to see a motorcycle approach, so she waved for help.  

The motorcycle rider was an untidy bearded man in shades and bandana, wearing a disreputable studded jacket, filthy jeans and heavy black boots.  The rider toed down his side-stand, swung his leg off the saddle, and stood up, reaching for a cigarette.  He looked at her and growled: “So what’s your story?”


The lady replied “Oh Thank the Lord that you have come!  I’ve locked my keys into my car and all I can do is pray.”


The biker walked up to the car and looked through the window, and sure enough, the keys were hanging in the ignition.  He looked around for something to open the door, and spotted a nearby barb wire fence.  With some twisting and bending, he managed to break   off a piece of wire, and with the help of a flattened beer can, he inserted the wire next to the window, looped it into the door catch, and opened the lock.


The lady was delighted.  She said “Oh thank you my Lord for sending me an angel.  You are a wonderful man!  Thank you so much!”


The biker replied: “Don’t say stuff like that, lady.  I’m not a good man. I’ve been a burglar and car thief for most of my life, and only last week got out of jail.”

Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country.  As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologised to the men for being late.

 I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around.  I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before, for this homeless man.

 And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""

After fighting the fire for over an hour, the chemical company president approached the fire chief and said, ""All of our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved! I'll give $50,000 to the engine company that brings them out safely!""

As soon as the chief heard this, he ordered the firemen to strengthen their attack on the blaze but to no avail.

After two more hours of attacking the fire, the president of the company offered $100,000 to the engine company that could bring out the company's secret files.

Just then a long siren was heard in the distance and another fire truck came into sight.

It was a local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over 65.

To everyone’s amazement the little fire engine raced through the chemical plant gates and drove straight into the middle of the inferno.

In the distance the other firemen watched as the old-timers hopped off of their rig and began to fight the fire with an effort that they had never seen before.

After an hour of intense fighting the volunteer company had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas.

The chemical company president was overjoyed and announced he'd double the reward to $200,000 and walked over to personally thank each of the volunteers.

After thanking each of the old men individually, the president asked the group what they intended to do with the reward money.

The fire truck driver looked him right in the eye and said, ""The first thing we’re going to do is fix the dang brakes on that truck.""","One dark night outside a small town, a fire started inside the local chemical plant.",194

The old lady instructs the women to stand in a line, the first woman turned away and bent over at the waist, the second leaning towards the genius arching her back with her chest pushed out, the third again facing away and bent over, the fourth facing the man with her breasts nearly in the mans face, the last three women are then turned around and bent over exposing their rears  to the man.  
Once in position the old lady looks to the genius, and tells him, 'this was my late husbands favorite song.  What is it?'  The genius unable to concentrate on anything other than the 7 beautiful naked women in front of him finally concedes that he doesn't know the answer.   He pays the woman his vast fortune and asks her the answer.

However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him.

The lawyer thinks blondes are dumb and that he can get one over on her easily, so the lawyer asks if the blonde would like to play a fun game. 

The blonde is tired and just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and tries to fall asleep. 

The lawyer persists saying that the game is a lot of fun.
""I'll ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5, then you'll ask me one, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $500."" 

This catches the blonde's attention and to keep the lawyer quiet, she agrees to play the game. 

The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the Earth to the Moon?""

The blonde quietly reaches into her pocket, pulls out a five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer. 

Now it's the blonde's turn. She asks, ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?""

The lawyer uses his laptop and searches all the references he could find on the internet; he sends e-mails to all the smart friends he knows, all to no avail. After an hour of searching, he finally gives up. 

He wakes up the blonde and hands her $500. The blonde pockets the $500 and goes right back to sleep.  

The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the blonde up and asks, ""Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?""

The blonde reaches into her pocket, hands the lawyer $5 and goes back to sleep.

As Johnny is walking home from school he looks to his left and sees two greyhounds racing,and one gets so far ahead of the other one that it just stops and the other one rams its head right up its ass.

Johnny takes out a piece of paper and writes it all down, saying to himself, 'This is going to be my report.'

The next day at school the teacher says, 'Johnny, do you have your report done?' He says, 'sure do.' So he goes up to the front of the class and starts telling them what he saw. 'Yesterday I was walking home from school when I saw these two greyhounds racing, and one rammed its head right up the other's ass.' The teacher says, 'Johnny, we don't use the word 'ass' in the classroom, it's rectum.' Johnny said, ""Rectum? Damn near killed 'Em.""

Note: Just wanted to share this joke, partly because I can't remember seeing it on Reddit before, but I'm sure I'm wrong, and because my father always quoted the punchline of the joke without actually telling the joke, but he loved that line.

You can go on for as long as you think the audience can take it.   As you approach the punchline (finally) make a show about trying to get out of harms way as you finally throw the end at them.

The owner looks up and sees him, being a typical liberal he decides to be nasty to the potential customer to make up for what he had read earlier during breakfast of herbal green tea and croissants. He had read that the Chinese regime ate Tibetan babies for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And on Sundays, they ate two.

As the Chinese man approaches the counter, the owner ignores him for a few long minute and then glares and growls at him, 'What do you want?'

The Chinese man politely informs him that he would like ten cans of dog food.

""No, can't do that. we have laws in this country. I need to see proof that you have a dog before I can sell you dog food"" huffs the owner ""I'm doing this for your own good, I don't want you eating it yourself and getting food poisoning.""

The Chinese man gives a sad sigh and walks away.

Half an hour later the Chinese man reappears but this time with a huge cardboard box and asks for ten cans of dog food again.

The owner almost screeches this time. ""Look, I told you, I cannot sell you dog food without proof, now get out!""

The Chinese man refuses to move and softy tells the owner he has brought the proof in the box.

The owner reaches into the box and pulls out the sorriest flea bitten mongrel puppy that he has ever seen. Having no more excuses not to sell the dog food, the owner place ten cans into the box but made sure to charge double the price, justifying the decit by promising to himself to put the extra into the Winnie Mandela lesbian feminist memorial fund.

The next day the Chinese man reappears but this time he asks for ten cans of cats food. Once again the owner sends him packing, demanding to see the proof of a cat. And once again the Chinese man reappeared later the same day with a huge cardboard box, this time containing a moth eaten almost ferral kitten.

The day after the Chinese man had wised up to the ways of the owner and had bought the huge cardboard box with him. The owner glares at the Chinese man and with face contorted with suppressed hate hisses out ""What is it this time, dog or cat?"" He reaches into the box and grabs something soft. He pulls out his hand which is now covered in a foul smelling greenish brown slime.

The Chinese man looks at him and says in a soft polite voice ""Please sir, can I have ten rolls of tiolet paper""

He digs it up, polishes it, and immediately a Genie appears.


“You have freed me from a thousand of years of imprisonment”, says the Genie. “As a reward I shall grant you one wish.”


“Well,” says the Prince, “I have all the material things I need, but let me show you this dog.”


They walk over to the splattered remains of the dog.


“Do you think you could bring this dog back to life for me?”, the Prince asks.


The Genie carefully looks at the remains and shakes his head. “This  body is too far gone for even me to bring it back to life. Is there something else you would like?”


The Prince thinks for a moment, then reaches into his pocket and takes out two photos.


“I was once married to this beautiful woman called Diana,” says Prince Charles, showing the Genie the first photo. “But now I love this woman
 called Camilla”, and he shows the Genie the second photo.


“As you can see, Camilla isn’t beautiful at all, so do you think you can make Camilla as beautiful as Diana?”

The man said “Mr. monk sir, my car has broken down.” So the monks fixed up his car, fed him, and gave him a place to sleep. At around midnight the man woke up to a deep ominous noise, and it made it hard for him to fall asleep, but he eventually did. When he woke up in the morning he asked the monks what the noise was. The monks replied “Oh sorry we can’t tell you, you’re not a monk.” So the man just brushes it off and heads off for work

A few years later on his way home from work he broke down in front of the same monastery. Then he knocked on the door again and said, “Mr. monk, I broke down again...” and the monk said “no it’s okay” and the monks gave him food, fixed his car, and gave him a place to sleep. Once again around the middle of the night he woke up to a deep ominous noise that made it difficult to fall back asleep. The next morning he again asked the monks what the noise was, and the once again responded “sorry we can’t tell you, you’re not a monk.” At this point the man got curious and said “what do I have to do to become a monk?” They responded “you have to count all the blades of grass, and all the grains of sand in the world” so the man went off. 

45 years later the man returned and said exactly how many grains of sand and blades of grass are on the earth. So the monks said “okay, now you can become a monk” the first thing the man does is ask where that noise is coming from, so they  showed him the door that the noise was coming from, finally he was going to find out what was making that noise. 

He reaches for the door handle... 

But it’s locked.

“Haha funny joke guys.” The monks all laugh and give him the key, so he opens the door to find another door. They give him the key for that and he opens the door to find another door, he finally gets to the last door and they give him the key...

He will finally figure out the noise.

He opens the door.

And what does he see?

There was the small tropical island far away from civilization. This island, the Island of Trid, was populated by the local islanders, the trids. They an idyllic culture. Easy and peaceful living in harmony with their surroundings. Their whole culture of worship revolved around the giants that lived at the top of the one mountain.

Every Sunday, the Trids would go to the base of the mountain and have a village wide picnic. They had fried chicken, fish, and fruits from the forests. They would enjoy this huge meal and then begin a long trek up the mountain to the cave of the giants. 

They would stand in single file line and a giant would grab each one in order and kick them down the hill where they tumbled to sea level. They would hop up, declare the miracle, and go with their families back to the village. 

This rabbi was just fascinated by the actions of this religion. He had read journals of this strange worship. This was the last of the world's religions that he hadn't taken part of a ceremony. The priest was able to get a plain flight to a small island and then get a two days boat ride to the island of Trid.

The rabbi arrived on a Saturday night and woke bright and early ready for a new enlightening spiritual ceremony unlike any other known! He was excited. He mingled with some locals and enjoyed a delightful meal. The rabbi observed as the villages all lined up and started walking up the mountain. He got at the end of the line.

At the top of the mountain, he is ecstatic with anticipation. He watches as the giant picks up an islander, kicks him down the hill, and follows it with the words, ""you're blessed"". The rabbi watched these Trids tumble down far below and hop up looking jubilant. Soon there are just two islanders left in front of him. Both are picked up and kicked down the slope. 

Finally he's standing in front of the giant. He's so excited and waiting to be picked up. The giant eyes him up and down, turns around, and starts to walk back into the cave,

""Wait,"" the rabbi calls. ""I've traveled thousands of miles to explore the spirituality and participate in the ceremonies. Please let me participate. I beg you.""

The giant turns around and walks back to the rabbi. He looks him up and down again, smirks, and says, ""Silly rabbi, kicks are for trids.""",There is a rabbi that studied all the religions of the world. He had worked his whole life to experience them all....,8

As he's waiting, he's thinking to himself ""Man, when's the last time I drove? I bet it's been thirty, maybe *fourty* years."" So when the driver pulls up, the pope politely asks him if he can drive. The driver, a bit unsure, thinks and says, ""Well, you're the pope"" and gets in the back. 

The pope shifts into drive and slowly makes his way onto Lake Shore Drive. Things go wrong from the start: he nearly sideswipes a delivery van, swerves crazily in front of a bus, and scrapes the side of the car against a light pole. A cop sees all of this, throws on his rollers and pulls up behind the pope's car. The pope, the good man that he is, pulls over on the shoulder right away. The cop gets off his motorcycle, struts up to the car and raps on the driver's side window. The pope obliges, rolls it down, and the cop gets a good look at who's driving. 

""One moment, sir"" the officer says before walking back to his bike.

He picks up his radio: ""Chief, hey, I've got a big problem here. I pulled over someone. Someone *big*, and I
don't know how to handle it.""

""Who'd you pull over, the captain?"" the chief asks.

""Nah, bigger than that.""

""Well, is it an alderman?"" the chief asks.

""I'm thinking he's more important.""

""Who in the hell did you pull over, the fuckin' mayor?!"" the chief nearly screams.

""I don't know who he is, but the pope's driving him!""

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,3

post,88yz5s,2qh72,jokes,false,1522672643,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/88yz5s/a_man_gets_a_job_as_a_train_conductor/,self.jokes,,"...for years he’s been great at his job. When the train arrives at the station he blows the whistle to announce the arrival and for the opening of the doors. After everyone gets off and on he, blows the whistle for the closing of the doors and the train departure.

It was a pretty mindless job and one day he was working away, blowing his whistle, the trains came and went, and on one particular train he thought everyone had boarded and he blew the whistle, when an old lady with her dog was still getting on the train. The doors closed and chopped the lady clean in half, killing her.

The man being responsible for this woman’s death was tried in court and found guilty of manslaughter. The sentence was death by the chair. He was placed in a cell until his execution. A few hours before he was to be killed, the warden came to his cell.

“You get one last meal, anything. You name it.”

“Really?” The man said. “Well if I were to have one last meal it would be 50kg of bananas

The warden looked stunned, he wasn’t sure if he heard him right, but the man looked sincere and who was he to deny him this last meal. 

So he buys 50kg of bananas and takes them back to the cell. The warden looks in amazement and disgust as the man devours the bananas skin and all.

After stuffing himself and making quite a mess, the man is led to the electric chair. He’s strapped in, and the electrodes attached. The executioner places his hand on the lever “3... 2... 1...” he pulls the lever and grimaces, only to find the man is perfectly fine. He pulls its again, and again but still nothing happens. They check the wires but everything is okay, the man just won’t die. 

The warden is stunned “We’ll only an act of God could save you. Clearly you just aren’t meant to die. Your free to go.” 

So the man leaves and gets a job as a train conductor. He’s doing the same thing, blowing the whistle for arrivals and departures. The trains come and go when one day all the passengers had gotten on board and he blew his whistle right as a little boy dropped his ball out the doors of the train. He went to retrieve it from the platform when BAM he was caught between the doors and sliced in two.

The man was tried and found guilty of murder, he was sent straight to prison to be executed the next day. He was sitting, stewing in his cell when the warden came along.

“Well it’s your last meal... again, what do you want this time?”

“Well since you’re asking, I’d like 50kg of bananas please.” The man says to the disgruntled warden.

The warden shakes his head and exhales in disbelief. “If you say so.” So he leaves to buy 50kg of bananas.

He returns and gives the bananas to the ravenous man and watches as he lobs them down his throat. To the wardens horror, he’s not even chewing them anymore just chucking them down whole. The man finishes and is taken away to be killed.

The executioner is surprised to see him again. The man is strapped in and attached to the electrodes once again. The executioner grips the handle that will end the mans life and yells “3... 2... 1...” and yanks the lever. Only to his absolute bewilderment, nothing happens. They check the wires, the chair the power and pull again and again but the man remains perfectly fine. By now the warden cannot believe his eyes, but the executioner proclaims “This is an act of God, clearly you are not meant to die, you have been spared yet again and are free to go” 

So the man leaves. 

And gets a job as a train conductor. He’s blowing his whistle and sending the trains off only this time he’s learnt from his mistakes. He’s intently looking for people every time a train comes and for several months he goes by without killing anyone.

Until one fateful day when he was doing his job and he saw the most beautiful woman he had ever the seen. As she strutted by he whistled and she turned and gave him a wink. Only the train driver heard the whistle and closed the door, crushing a business man, splitting him in twain. 

He was seized and sent to court, tried and found guilty of murder for the third time. The judge was done with him and sentenced him to death that day. As he was sitting in his cell once again, the warden came to him.

“50kg of bananas?” He asked the man

“50kg of bananas.” The man replied

The warden walked away, baffled at the events of the past couple of months. He returned with 50kg of bananas and gave them to the man only this time he didn’t finish all the bananas as he had eaten quite a large breakfast. The warden marched him to the electric chair and strapped him in, curious as to what would happen. The executioner is also intrigued as to whether or not the man will cheat death yet again. He grasps the lever and counts down. “3... 2... 1...” he pulls the lever and...

...nothing happens.

The executioner has just given up at this point and says “Well it’s an act of God. Clearly you just aren’t meant to die yet, just promise me you won’t get a job at that damn train company.” 

The man makes no promises and walks away, a free man. The warden runs up to him. Panting he asks.

“I have to ask, how have you cheated the electric chair so many times? Is it the bananas?”

Calmly the man replies “No, I’m just a really bad conductor.”

EDIT: This is not my joke, a friend of mine told me this a while ago, I guess on a sub with 13 000 000 people someone has to have read it before, I took the essence of the joke and wrote it how I would like to have heard it so it’s not original but I like to think I added at least something to it.

'But, that is exactly the same as all the other hells why are there so many people waiting to get in?' asks the man.

Later that evening it started a torrential downpour, and our traveling saleman began to feel a mighty shit coming on.  He thought to himself that he could hold it until morning, but felt the turtle head working it's way out. He was dreading going out in the rain when luck would have it, he spotted a few mason jars. He began to relieve himself filling up no less than four. He then tucked them away and hope no one would notice.

The next morning he got his tow truck and was on his way. 

About a week had passed, and he felt guilty about what he had done. So, he went back the farmhouse with a hundred dollars to give to the farmer and his wife to thank them for their hospitality. 

He stops at the farmhouse and is greeted by the old farmer.

The farmer next door had a big old pig in the front yard.  Huge.  Easily 300 pounds.  It had  a peg leg, but that didn't  slow it down at all.  It was running around, playing with the dogs, and eating every scrap of food the farmer's kids threw to it.  He came by to get some diesel for his tractor, and I asked him about the pig.  ""What's with the peg leg?""

He said, ""Son, let me tell ya somethin'!  That right there has got to be the smartest pig I ever owned.  Just last week, the horse barn caught fire in the middle of the night, and before anybody could do a darn thing about it, that pig busted out a' his pen and opened the door, savin' my horses!""

He left pretty quick, leaving me impressed at the heroic pig.  I made it a point to drop back by as I returned from my trip, and to my surprise, the pig had two peg legs!  He was still as active as ever.  I waved down the farmer, and before I could even ask, he said, ""Hey!  Yer back!  Guess what, my pig's a bona-fide hero now.  There was a pile up right out here in front of the gas station, whole bunch a' cars all smashed up and burnin'.  That pig pulled half a dozen people out a' their cars before the whole thing went boom!""

I was pretty shocked.  I mean, a pig that heroic was kind of unbelievable, so I wasn't surprised when I told my family the story, and they didn't believe me.  So, I packed them all in the car and we drove to the small town to see the pig.

When we got there, he had three peg legs!  I knocked on the farmer's door, my whole family behind me.  The second he opened the door, I asked, ""What happened?""

He recognized me immediately, and shook my hand, saying, ""Oh, you won't believe this.  That there pig saved the mayor's boy from drownin'!  We brought him to the lake with us, and he heard the screamin'.  He runs out into the water, and swims out, and pulls the boy back to safety!  What a pig!""

I blink.  ""How did he lose a leg swimming?""

""He didn't,"" the farmer answers with a shrug.

""Then, how did he lose his leg?  He lost his other legs saving horses and drivers and stuff, right?""

The farmer starts laughing.  ""No, boy, no.  He saved four horses, and right 'round eight people by now, but he ain't lost a thing doin' none of that.""

Confused, I ask, ""Then, why does he keep losing legs every time I see him?""

The farmer leaned in close and whispered, ""Boy, you don't eat a pig that fine, but one ham at a time.""","I drove through a small town,",0

So they got more people and made two teams. One of the teams were fierce and strong and named themselves after eagles. The other team was lackluster so they got nicknamed the crows.

The two teams played against each other in both team's first game. Many excited spectators came to watch. They had heard about it advertised and hyped for such a long time that many came to see what it all was about.

The game started with fans singing 'Take Me Out To The Ball Game."" People laughed, waved foam hands, and munched on hot dogs. The players walked onto the field and there was a hush.

The game began.

The eagles did spectacularly in the first 8 innings. They made many home runs. They were in the lead. Fans shrieked like eagles everytime they made a home run and it became popular throughout the stadium.

Now, Bill was watching this on television for 2 hours. It was the ninth inning and he was engrossed in the game. His wife came in and sat next to him. She wanted to find out why he was making bird noises. 

The husband explained to her that the eagles were amazing at baseball and that was why he cheered. The wife was confused at which team the eagles were. The husband said, ""Just watch.""

The game continued on the big screen. One of the eagle batters came up. He hit the ball spectacularly bad and it went straight into the catcher's mitt. There was the sound of boos throughout the stadium.

The wife remarked, ""Judging from how that guy played, I'm guessing the other team is the eagles, right? That team was such a joke.""

The husband was scandalised. ""No, that team was the eagles. That was just a bad play by them. They're still way in the lead. You want to see a real joke? The real joke is in the caw-mets.""",One of the NY baseball teams decided to split up.,0
