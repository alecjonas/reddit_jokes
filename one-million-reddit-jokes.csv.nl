Because of his parents frugal decision, his eye was clearly fake. This upset him especially near his senior year prom. Most would think that a star athlete at a high school should be able to take any girl to prom, but alas, Johnny had no luck. Until Betty came to his school. She was a beautiful red-headed girl who had just moved in from Tennessee. Everything about her was gorgeous, except she also had a single abnormality, her mouth was rotated 90 degrees so that one side of her mouth was on her chin, and the other was directly below her nose. Johnny knew he could ask her to go to the prom with him and she'd have to accept. He walked up to her at her locker a few days before the prom and asked her to join him at prom.

Sure enough, every Sunday afternoon the bowl was refilled again and again and emptied just like the previous week by all who worked there.

The staff figured that they were brought by the family of the new patient when they visited so give thanks for taking care of their loved one.  However the mystery was solved early one Sunday afternoon when one of the staff happened to be at the desk when the new elderly patient was seen carrying a fresh bowl of peanuts up.

""Oh, so you're the one who keeps refilling that bowl full of nuts"", said one of the the nurses.

""Yes it's me,"" says the old woman, ""I was hoping you would enjoy them but you guys eat them so darn fast.  It takes me nearly a week to suck all the chocolate off them.""

Starving and desperate for shelter, they knock on the door and see a giant of a man. They explain their plight, and he agrees to feed them and let them stay the night, on the condition that they do not touch either of his two daughters. 

They hastily agree, and sit down for the best dinner of their lives. The man's daughters join them, and they are absolutely gorgeous. The men exchange a nervous glance, but both think that they could not betray the nice man who helped them. 

Later that night, as they are sleeping in an upstairs room, the two daughters enter and wordlessly slip into the men's beds, already nude.  Figuring they can get away with it, the men have sex with the daughters, then drift into sleep. 

That morning, as the men head downstairs for breakfast, they find the man standing there with his daughters, holding a shotgun. 

""I told you"", he says. ""Now, you're going to go out to my garden, pick 10 of any fruit you want, and bring them back to me. Or I'm going to shoot you here and now.""

Confused and scared, the men head out to the garden to pick their fruits. The first man finds 10 cherries close by, grabs them, and hurries back to the cabin, eager to get whatever is about to happen over with. The man says to him:

""Now, you're going to shove all 10 of these cherries up your ass, and if you can do that without making a sound, I'll let you go.""

Horrified, the man starts shoving cherries up his ass. He gets to the 9th one, and suddenly bursts out with laughter. 

""What the hell is wrong with you?"", the old man asks. ""You were almost done.""

""I know"", the first man says, ""But I just realized, my friend is out there picking pineapples.""",Two men stumble upon a house in the woods.,6

Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue.

The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.

Startled, he drops a bar of soap.

""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"".

To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice, and three times but nothing happens.

John Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm.


The night was rolling on and no car went by.


The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him.


Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped.


John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... only to realise there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on.


The car started moving slowly.


John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of no where through the window and turned the wheel. 


John, paralysed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him.
Shortly thereafter John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it.


Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just had.


A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realised he was crying and....wasn't drunk.


Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other.... ..........


'Look Paddy.....there's that fecking idiot that got in the car while we were pushing it!!!!

There was an island in the middle of the lake, over which the kingdoms had been fighting for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in). The battle raged, and when the dust had cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms, thus proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

post,6le3x6,2qh72,jokes,false,1499262415,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6le3x6/there_was_once_a_man_named_yuri/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Yuri.

Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",There was once a man named Yuri,0

The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself. When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. And there he also met the mermaid. ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""

Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""",On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three sons,1985

The manager, finding such claim amusing, accepted the offer and told his top chef, Jenny to prepare the House Special Soup, a truly delicious dish where the recipe of which is highly secretive.

Once it is served, the man tasted a spoonful and listed out all the ingredients on a paper. The manager took the paper and went in the kitchen to show Jenny and to their surprise, the man correctly listed all the ingredients used in the soup, including the exact content of the secret ingredient used. 

It was time for the second dish and Jenny had an idea, she stuck her finger down her vagina, scratch around for a bit, and stuck the same finger into a a bowl of stew, thinking they have surely won the bet.

The manager served it to the man and the man once again tasted a spoonful. There was a change in his face, and he said:

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.
Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.
The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.
The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.
Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.
After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.
The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and
wondering what might be the source of the noise.
In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the boss asked to see the room first.
He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.
The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good
tip and left the hotel smiling.
The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he
heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.
After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.
The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.
This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible.
 He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something
to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.
Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.
The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.
The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.
To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.
The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.
In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.
-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.
Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Uptil now, he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.
When he does, I'll let you guys know.

        His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. 
        “Welcome to heaven,” says St. Peter. “Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high-ranking official around these parts, you see, so we’re not sure what to do with you.” 
        “No problem, just let me in,” says the politician. 
        “Well, I’d like to, but I have orders from the higher-ups. What we’ll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.” 
        “Really? I’ve made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,” says the politician. 
        “I’m sorry, but we have our rules.” 
        And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. 
        The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse, and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. 
        Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had getting rich at the expense of the people. They then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest Champagne. 
        Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy and who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes. 
        They are all having such a good time that before the politician realizes it, it is time to go. 
        Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises. 
        The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. “Now it’s time to visit heaven …” 
        So, 24 hours pass with the politician joining a group of contented souls, moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. 
        “Well, then, you’ve spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.” 
        The politician reflects for a minute, then he answers: “Well, I would never have said it before — I mean heaven has been delightful — but I think I would be better off in hell.” 
        So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell … 
        Now the doors of the elevator open and he’s in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground. 
        The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders. 
        “I don’t understand,” stammers the politician. “Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank Champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there’s just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?” 
        The devil smiles at him and says, 
        “Yesterday we were campaigning, Today, you voted.”",Politician dies and arrives in heaven,159

Arthur was apparently embarrassed, but finally he said, ""Excuse me, but aren't you the inventor of the woman?""

Bob thought about it for a while, and figured out that being a dog is too tiring, but a hen probably has a nice and relaxed life. Running around with a rooster can't be that bad. 

""I want to return as a hen,"" Bob replied.

""How do I do that?"" Bob asked. 

""Cluck twice, and then you push all you can."" 

Bob clucked twice and pushed more than he was good for, and then 'plop' an egg was on the ground.

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the owner behind the counter. He explained his situation, the old man ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except..."" and he stopped.""

""Except what?""

""Nothing, nothing.""

""C'mon, tell me ! I need something!""

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'""

""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" Johny asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!""

""Ahh, but you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""

He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door.""

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said

""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!""

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

Johnny: ""I'll take it!""

The old man resisted, saying ""it wasn't for sale"", but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. John took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say...

""Voodoo dick, my pussy.""

He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said:

""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""

Edit: Johnny instead of Johny, u happy now u/plasdfl ?","Yea, right.",170

To save face the boy's parents invited the superintendent and a few select teacher's over for dinner to discuss Tommy's future at the school. The young boy wanted to be able to turn over a new leaf and really wow the faculty so he decided to learn some new vocabulary to impress tonight's dinner guests.

A couple of hours before the guests arrived Tommy was wandering around the house looking for some pointers. He came across his dad who was in the den watching television. ""Good afternoon you Bitches and Bastards!"" Said the announcer on the tv.
""Dad, what does Bitches and Bastards mean?"" Asked the boy.
""Oh...uhh.."" The dad stumbled his words. ""It means Ladies and Gentlemen my son."" The boy writes this down on his notepad and walks away.

In the kitchen he sees his mom cutting up a spiral ham with a chef's knife. She looks up at him and accidentally slices open her thumb ""fucking thing!"" She exclaims in a hushed breath as she begins to run her thumb under the sink.
""Mom, what does Fucking mean?""
""Oh... Haha.."" She chuckles nervously to and tries to find the words. ""It means Carving, you know, to Carve with a knife""
""Cool!"" The boy says, and writes this down on his notepad and skips away to the den where he finds his grandpa watching TV.

""Welcome back to XXX after dark, tonight is all about pussies and dicks."" A sultry voice from the TV says, the grandpa grabs the remote and shuts the TV off.
""Grandpa, what does pussies and dicks mean?"" Asks the boy. ""Well.. You see sonny it means..."" The nervous grandpa mumbles. ""Its a french word for Hats and Coats."" 
The boy quickly writes this down on his notepad as he is sure that a foreign language would impress the adults. Thank you Grandpa! The boy says, as he runs up to his room to get ready for dinner.""

The guests are soon to arrive at any moment and the boy and his family are all ready for their presence. All except his dad who was nowhere to be found. The boy looks around the house for his father and finds him in the bathroom shaving.
""DAD! C'MON!"" the boy yells causing the father to knick his cheek with the razor. 
""SHIT!"" his dad yells as he puts the razor down to face his son.
""Dad, what does shit mean?"" 
""It means to shave son.""
The doorbell rings.
""Please go and answer to our guests, i will be out soon"" says the father.

The boy runs to the door clutching his notepad in hand and opens it right as the guests begin to walk in and With confidence in his voice he says,

""Good evening Bitches and Bastards! Please come inside and place your Pussies and Dicks on the coat rack. My mom just finished fucking up the ham and my dad is in the bathroom shitting but he will be with us soon!""","Kid learns ""fancy"" words. #1",42

Addressing all three of them, the doctor said: ""if any of you indulge in your vices one more time, you will definitely die.""

The men left the doctor's office, each convinced that he would never again indulge in his vice.

While walking towards the railway station for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a peg of whiskey. No sooner had he placed the glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone dead.

Totally shaken up, his companions left the bar, realising how seriously they must take the doctor's words.

As they walked along, they came up a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning. Frantically, the homosexual looked at the chain-smoker and warned: ""If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead!""",The final warning,30

They call up the resort's resident doctor. He takes her into his office for an examination. 

""Yup. It looks like a bee has crawled into your daughter's vagina. It's still alive, but it doesn't look like it'll be easy to extract without aggravating it and causing it to sting her.""

""What do we do!?"" the dad asks. 

""Well,"" the doctor says, ""Bees like honey. So if you just smear a little honey around the entrance of her privates, it might draw the thing out, and you can grab it with tweezers."" And the doctor hands the man a jar of honey and some tweezers. 

""Oh no, Doc!"" he says. ""I'm not touching my girl like that down there! You're the doctor. You do it!""

""Alright,"" the doctor says. ""I guess I can do it. But you should be present, in case...""

""No way! I don't even want to watch this! I'll wait outside."" Off the man goes. ""Call me when it's over.""

He expects it to be a quick procedure, but after five minutes there's still no word. He pokes his head back in the door. The girl is moaning and squirming as the doctor gently, delicately smears honey around the entrance of her vagina, over and over. ""I'm so sorry,"" the doctor stammers awkwardly. ""Unfortunately, she's, um... getting so, um... lubricated from the, um... stimulation, the honey just dribbles right out again. I'll have to go a little deeper.""

""Alright. Go ahead,"" the guy says, ""Just get it out of there!"" And he leaves again.

Five minutes later, he pokes his head in again. Now the doctor is leaning over the young lady, with his arm behind her back and his cheek against her breasts, holding her steady while he thrusts two fingers inside her as deep as they can go. She's moaning and grinding and thrusting her pelvis around on the examination table. 

""What the hell, Doc!?"" the guy says.

""Well, um... the problem now is, she keeps climaxing from the stimulation of inserting the honey, and the, um... fluids are making the honey leak right out again. So I had to go even deeper. Since she keeps tightening up so much, this was the only angle, I could... well, you know. I'm so sorry.""

""Okay,"" the father says. ""Weird, but I guess you know what you're doing."" He leaves.

Five minutes later, the guy hears outright screams of ecstasy coming from the doctor's office. He throws the door open and finds the doctor on top of the young woman fucking the shit out of her. ""What the hell is going on here!?"" he demands to know.

""Change of plans!"" the doctor says, thrusting away. ""We're gonna drown that little fucker!""","A beautiful young woman is sunbathing on the beach of an upscale resort, when she feels a buzzing in her vagina.",857

This guy is talking to a group of friends,

""I want my wife dead, but I don't want to do it myself, I'll pay anyone $1000 to kill her for me"".

One of his friends Arty speaks up and says,

""I don't like your wife either, I'll do it for a dollar"".

""Great""! He responds, ""you can find her at Coles Monday morning, good luck"".

**Monday morning arrives**

Arty approaches his friend's wife from behind, wraps his hands round her neck, and asphyxiates her to death. Pleased with himself, Arty turns around to find that one of the customers has seen the whole thing, so he does what is necessary and strangles her to death too. Accomplished, Arty walks round the corner to find the manager, peering through some shelves, he had witnessed the entire incident. Once again, Arty must take matters into account, and suffocates a second innocent bystander. 

*Arty leaves*

Over the next few weeks, police find out about the entire thing.

A man came in and asked to buy half a head of lettuce. The boy told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce, but the man replied that he did not need a whole head, but only a half head. 

The shop assisant said he would go ask his manager about the matter. 

He said to his manager, ""There's some asshole out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce."" As he was finishing saying this, he turned around to find the man standing right behind him, so he added, ""and this gentleman wants to buy the other half."" The manager okayed the deal and the man went on his way. 

Later the manager called on the boy and said, ""You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got yourself out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here. Where are you from son?"" 

The boy replied, ""Minnesota sir."" 

""Oh really? Why did you leave Minnesota"" asked the manager. 

The boy replied, ""They're all just whores and hockey players up there."" 

""Really?,"" replied the manager, ""My wife is from Minnesota!!"" 

The boy replied, ""No kidding! What team did she play for?""
