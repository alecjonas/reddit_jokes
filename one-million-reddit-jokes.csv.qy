A very distinguished lady was on a plane arriving from Switzerland. She found herself seated next to a nice priest whom she asked: ""Excuse me Father, could I ask a favour?""

""Of course my child, What can I do for you?""

""Here is the problem, I bought myself a new sophisticated hair remover gadget for which I paid an enormous sum of money. I have really gone over the declaration limits and I am worried that they will confiscate it at customs. Do you think you could hide it under your cassock?""

""Of course I could, my child, but you must realize that I cannot lie.""

""You have such an honest face Father, I am sure they will not ask you any questions"", and she gave him the ""hair remover"".

The aircraft arrived at its destination. When the priest presented himself to customs he was asked, ""Father, do you have anything to declare?""

""From the top of my head to my sash, I have nothing to declare, my son, he replied.

Finding this reply strange, the customs officer asked, ""And from the sash down, what do you have?""

The priest replied, ""I have there a marvellous little instrument destined for use by women, but which has never been used.""

Breaking out in laughter, the customs officer said, ""Go ahead Father. Next!""

But no matter how hard people tried, the rock hard wandering cock in peoples mouth made it impossible for people to either pronounce the lyrics or fight their gag reflexes while maintaining their pitch.

After hours of gargling his bellend, disappointed, the man started to pull his pants up when from the back of the bar a quiet pale lady offered to do the deed.

""One condition: you have to shut down all the lights from this bar. It has to be in pitch black darkness.""

The man agreed to the ladys suggestion and asked the bartender to close the lights. The man placed his hands on top of her head and started thrusting. 

And from the now silent bar, an angel-like voice articulated perfectly.

&gt;""Should Old Acquaintance be forgot,    
and never thought upon;

Baffled and flabbergasted, the man had finally found what he sought. ""I can't believe it, she must be cheating somehow."" he tought. ""I must find out how"".

I've never tried to type it out before, so sorry if this sucks, but here's how I first heard it:
A man goes to prison and the first night while he's laying in bed contemplating his situation, he hears someone yell out, ""44!"" Followed by laughter from the other prisoners.
He thought that was pretty odd, then he heard someone else yell out, ""72!"" Followed by even more laughter.
""What's going on?"" he asked his cellmate.
""Well, we've all heard every joke so many times, we've given them each a number to make it easier.""
""Oh,"" he says, ""can I try?""
""Sure, go ahead.""
So, he yells out ""102!"" and the place goes nuts. People are whooping and laughing in a hysteria. He looks at his cellmate rolling on the ground with tears in his eyes from laughing so hard.
""Wow, good joke huh?""
""Yeah! We ain't never heard that one before!""
And here's the other punchline that threw me for a loop after years of hearing this joke:
So, he yells out ""102!"" and the place is dead quiet save for a few groans. Confused, he looks at his cellmate who is just shaking his head.
""Hey, what happened?""
""Well, some people can tell a joke, some people can't.""

As Little Johnny heads to the kitchen for breakfast, he stops outside his parent's room to listen to them argue.

Later on, in the kitchen he asks them, ""What does bitch and bastard mean?"" They explain that a bitch is a lady, and a bastard is a gentleman. 

After everything is cleared away, Little Johnny happens upon his older sister having sex with her boyfriend, in their old playhouse. When they come out, Little Johnny asks them, ""What does penis and vagina mean?"" Fixing their clothes, they explain that they refer to hats and jackets.

When Little Johnny goes inside, his mom is in the kitchen, cooking.  As he's walking by, she screams, ""Fuck!"", and he asks her what that means.  ""It's another word for stuffing"" she says, slamming the turkey onto the counter.

Later on, Little Johnny is watching his dad get ready for dinner. His dad cuts himself with the razor and yells, ""Shit!""  Little Johnny asks what shit means, and his dad tells him it means the same as shaving.

As the doorbell rings, Little Johnny's dad shoves him out of the bathroom and tells him to answer it.   ""Alright.""  Little Johnny grumbles.

He skulks downstairs, throws open the door and says, ""Hello bitches and bastards! Hurry up with your penises and vaginas! Dad's in the bathroom shitting himself, and mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey!""

That Sunday, the man takes the advice, gets into the costume and hides behind a gravestone. Shortly, the nun appears and prays.

The man pops out from the gravestone and declares, ""I am God, and I command you to have sex with me.""

The nun replies, ""Sure, but only if we have anal sex.""

In particular was collecting and managing the taxes, which of course, was of vital importance to pay for the war. So, a top secret program was devised, unbeknownst to even the Führer himself, that would hopefully remedy the problem, and allow the government to be more efficient than ever: they would train animals to mange the government's responsibilities for them. 

Of course, only the brightest species would do. It would take an animal with a great deal of intelligence to understand the byzantine tax code, do the complex math of the accounting involved, and of course, actually collect the taxes. German officials searched far and wide for an animal that could do the job. First, they thought to try dolphins, one of the smartest species on earth. Unfortunately, the dolphins' lack of opposable thumbs made it almost impossible for any of them to hold a pen, and they couldn't write underwater without the paper getting all wet as it was. So the officials moved on. Next, the officials looked at dogs. Dogs were very loyal and very easily trained, and they could be taught to write using their paws. At first, it seemed perfect, but alas, the dogs simply wouldn't focus. Nothing could be done to change their excitably nature.

Then, finally, one day, came a breakthrough. A geologist studying caves in the north of the country noticed some strange behavior in the animal species. Before he could publish, his research was confiscated by the government, and given to the secret research unit working on the project. He had found that some of the mammals in the caves appeared to display some kind of super intelligence, noting a particular propensity among those of the family Chiroptera for counting and organizing. ""Perfect!"", thought the German officials. These animals could be trained with ease, and they would do the job magnificently. They could even hold regular pens and pencils with the tiny claws on their wings. 

Unfortunately, their optimism eventually got the better of them. Seeing how apt the species were for the job, the training was not made nearly rigorous enough, and the animals just couldn't   handle the challenges of the job. In the end, the project was an ultimate failure. However, it will always be remembered by the name the scientists gave it after the fact,

post,5creg7,2qh72,jokes,false,1479063495,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5creg7/mms/,self.jokes,,"Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels.
Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them breaks and splinters. That is the ""loser,"" and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.
I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.
Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.
When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 07840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3x5 card reading, ""Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.""
This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this ""grant money."" I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion.",M&amp;Ms,5

got on, a few got off, and things went generally well. At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on. Six feet eight, built like a  wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and  said, ""Big John doesn't pay!"" and sat down at the back.


Now, the driver was only five feet three, thin, and basically 
meek. Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he  
wasn't happy about it. The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that and so forth.


This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him. Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.


By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself. So on the next Monday, when Big John once  again got on the bus and said, ""Big John doesn't pay!,"" The driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, ""And why not?"" With a surprised 
look on his face, Big John replied,

_______

A young Irish lady of pristine virtue, engaged to be married in a few months, visits the vicar to ask a question of church law.

yl: Father, as you know I'm engaged to be married soon...

v: Yes, my child?

yl: My fiance and I have urges, very strong urges, and while I don't wish to disappoint him I certainly don't want to put my soul in danger.  So I was wondering about the church's attitude about other... things.

v: We all have urges my dear, it is part of the burden we must carry. What sort of... things... do you mean?

yl: This is very difficult.  Father, I, er, I would like to ask... hoo! This is not easy.  [more resolutely] Father, I must ask... what is the church's attitude toward... fellatio?

v: FELLATIO???

yl: Yes, fellatio.

v: Well my dear, it's not that I... I would like to advise... I'd like to tell you, but you see, I haven't any idea what fellatio is, I'm sorry.

yl: Perhaps it's easier if I demonstrate

And from that day on, whenever the vicar was asked ""what is the church's attitude toward fellatio"" the vicar can say:

I'd like to tell you, but you see, I haven't any idea what fellatio is!",The Vicar's Opinion,4

'It sunk in the middle of the Atlantic. I hadn't made sure that all the security checks had been made before it set off, and now I'm living a life of depression and guilt. That's why I'm on this yacht today. I want to make a little prayer while we cross the Atlantic for my parents.'

'I'm so sorry, lad. I think we'll both make a prayer for them when we've got to the Atlantic.'

'That'll be great,' the rich man said.

Finally, he comes upon a small, dimly-lit curio shop with a blinking sign. He tries the door and it opens, ringing a tiny bell as it does so. 

The store is filled with strange, arcane items like ancient leatherbound books, glass jars full of glowing liquid and strange tribal masks. Fine silk robes, cloaks and headdresses line the walls. Skulls with candles melted on them provide the only light, and stuffed animals adorn the walls. The place smells of incense and age. 

The man despairs of finding anything remotely suitable for his wife and is fixing to leave when an ancient, white-haired man with a glass eye and a cane appears behind the counter. The man, somewhat awkwardly, explains that he was after a present for his wife. 

The shopkeeper says nothing. He gives the man a long, appraising look before turning slowly and shuffling back out to the rear of the store. The man waits a few moments and then uncertainly starts making his way towards the front door. He is about to depart when the shopkeeper returns and places an intricately-carved wooden box on the counter. He gestures to the man, who approaches the counter cautiously. 

At the wordless prompting of the shopkeeper, the man opens the box to reveal a large, bright-green frog which sits patiently in the box and makes no effort to escape. The shopkeeper nods slightly. 

The man is perplexed. He reiterates to the shopkeeper that he was after a present for his wife's birthday, and politely suggests that a frog in a box probably wouldn't be very well-received. 

The shopkeeper seems to go on a long journey inside himself to find a voice. At last, in a thin and rasping whisper, he speaks. ""This frog,"" he says, ""gives the best blowjobs in the world."" 

The man blinks. He looks behind himself. With a half smile, he begins to explain again that he needs a present for his wife. The shopkeeper interrupts him by saying ""The best blowjobs. In the world. You may try it in our fitting room."" He indicates a curtain in the corner of the shop. 

Feeling like he's in a dream, the man takes the box and makes his way to the fitting room. The shopkeeper, after glancing at his watch, remains at the counter and studies his fingernails. 

Two minutes later, the man throws the fitting room curtain aside and returns to the counter, placing the box down as he digs in his pocket for his wallet. ""Sold!"" he says breathlessly. ""Do you offer gift wrapping?"" The shopkeeper nods with a hint of a smile and wraps the box elaborately, affixing an intricate bow of fine silk. The man slaps down a wad of notes and runs from the shop before the shopkeeper can produce his change. 

Fifteen minutes later, he screeches to a crooked halt in his driveway. He grabs the box and dashes to the front door, unlocking it with one hand as he cradles the gift in the other. The door of his car remains wide open. 

Upon entering, he sees his wife on the couch in front of the TV watching The Bachelor. She is texting on her phone, a half-eaten bag of microwave popcorn in her lap. She glances up with a frown. ""You're late,"" she says as she rummages in her popcorn bag and looks back at the TV. 

The man drops his briefcase and hurries over to her. With a flourish, he produces the gift and places it in her lap with an enthusiastic ""Happy Birthday!"" He then steps back a few paces and, hopping from foot to foot, adds, ""Open it! Open it! Oh boy oh boy oh boy!""

His wife puts her phone down and unwraps the present, trying to see past him to the TV. Finally the paper falls away and she lifts the lid to reveal the frog. She drops the box and leaps to her feet. 

""A frog? What the hell? Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you? Are you insane? A frog!? What the hell am I supposed to do with a goddamn frog?""

The man sits down on the couch, changes the channel and says, ""Teach it to cook and fuck off.""","On his way home, a man suddenly remembers it's his wife's birthday.",2

It was my first night of vacation in Tijuana, Mexico. It was the summer of 2015 and I had just taken a break from my stint in the Navy.

Lupita was a beautiful Mexican woman, age 24. She was also very heavy, but beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. I met her in the bar and took her back to my hotel for the night. After sliding the condomn on my penis, I was so excited to sleep with this woman, but did not realize what would become of me.

Lupita and I stripped down and began going at it, doggystyle. I receive a blowjob and then she layed on top of me. I was on my back and she was looking down into my eyes. I put my thingy up in that snatch and we began going, with fast and rough motions. Her butt was bouncing up and down, all 400 pounds of it. I began smashing her hole and was close to orgasm, when I heard a loud pop like a pipe bomb had gone off. 

Looking down, I grimaced and realized my entire penis had been busted open, veins hanging out and my left nut hanging out of my sack. I panicked and screamed for help. Lupita called 911 and started running out of the room. I scream Stop! Stop!, Where are you going?

The last thing I heard Lupita say as she bolted out the door was ""You are the Fifth one, I blew out Pedro's Cock Too, I'm immigrating and going for Donald Trump next baby. Hasta Luego! Fuck the fence. Fuck the fence. I will destroy the Trump fence too. Hasta luego!


I still remember that night, and 4 surgeries later I am able to receive blowjobs, but not fuck with my penis. This is due to the permanent scarring and the 5 metal staples which have to be left in for life. Be careful in Tijuana my friends, and if you see a girl named Lupita at Diego's Burrito Shop. Run like fuck!

Lupita is Dangerous.
