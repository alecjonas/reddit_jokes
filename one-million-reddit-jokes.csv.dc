This courtier, in particular, was known to be considerably disliked by the rest of the court, on account of rumors about the true nature of his parentage (it was alleged that his mother had been impregnated by a base commoner who had been able to slip past the guards of his father's manor house). While they would never stoop to an assassination attempt, the nobles generally agreed that the boy was an embarrassment, and that something must be done to remove him from the court to spare the Emperor from his unsightly existence.  


One of the higher-ranking nobles was able to catch the Emperor's ear, and suggested to his Heavenly Majesty that it might be advisable for the king to map out some of his southern provinces in greater detail, and that a trusted advisor should accomplish the work- someone like young Lu Zhishen, who had served the Emperor well and was likely suited to such a task. The Emperor agreed to this, and before long Lu Zhishen was forced to pack his bags and set out to the South.  


Lu Zhishen first stopped in a village named Shānjiǎo, which means Mountain Foot. The beds there were rough, the people spoke in an uncouth manner, and there was little to no of the luxury he had become accustomed to. As his retainers bargained for supplies and scouted out the local woods. Lu Zhishen felt a restlessness creep over him, and resolved to inspect the village himself, to determine anything of interest that might befit the attention of the Emperor. He left his room, and, upon surveying the village for a few minutes, noted a few strange anomalies. Firstly, there were no young men of his age. There were boys, older men, and the elderly, and girls of every age, but it seemed as if all the young men between twenty and thirty summers of age had mysteriously vanished. Secondly, as he inspected the tall mountain range for which the village was named, he noted a strange red shape high up along the winding path through the mountains.  


Pulling aside an old man, he interrogated him for answers.  
""Old man, what is up on that mountain, and why can I find no young men within this village?""  
The old man smiled his toothy grin, and replied thus:  
""Upon that mountain is the temple of the Buddha. Once the young men here reach twenty years of age, they are required to climb that mountain and spend ten years in the temple along with the other monks there.""  
""Ten years!"" Lu Zhishen exclaimed. ""And what do they accomplish while they are up there? Do they debate, or read scripture?""  
The old man shook his head. ""They meditate, in utter silence. Once a man steps foot through the gateway of the temple, he must not speak another word until a decade has passed.""  


Stunned and fascinated by this, Lu Zhishen returned to his quarters, where he took a meager meal and rested until the morning. When he woke up, he left the inn only to find that the town was nearly empty, devoid of any inhabitants. Returning to the innkeeper, he inquired about this.  
""They are likely waiting out in their fields,"" the innkeeper replied. ""It is the harvest day- the day of the reaping.""  
""Waiting?"" Lu Zhishen replied. ""There are only so many hours in the day to work- whatever are they waiting for?""  
""The monks,"" the innkeeper replied. ""It is customary for the monks to begin the reaping.""  


Lu Zhishen walked to the fields, and sure enough watched as a chain of orange-clothed monks descended down the mountain. Meanwhile, the farmers all stood idle in their fields, watching the group slowly descend. All this was quite irritating to Lu Zhishen, but he kept quiet as the ritual proceeded. Finally, the monks arrived, each carrying boxes from which emanated a delicious smell. All at once, the monks stood at attention, and with the ringing of a bell from the center monk (who Lu Zhishen determined to be an abbot or leader of some kind), all of them shouted ""Time to harvest!""  
All at once, all of the farmers sprung to work- some cutting their fields, others sampling the food the monks had brought. Meanwhile, the monks broke into fevered discussion- amongst themselves, and to the farmers. This confused Lu Zhishen greatly, and so he turned to a nearby farmer.  
""Doesn't it break their vows to shout and speak like that?""  
The farmer shrugged. ""You'd think so, but apparently not. The abbot only permits speech now, and only he knows why. You could've asked the old abbot, but unfortunately, he died a month ago.""  


The next day, Lu Zhishen set off on his journey to map the rest of the South. He encountered many more adventures, most of which are too long and too complex to be fully detailed here. There were many things that seemed strange or obscure, but none so much as that peculiar farming ritual he had observed his first week in Shānjiǎo. He puzzled it over in his head for months on end, but could never come to a conclusion as to why such a flagrant violation would be allowed under the laws of the monastery.  


A year after he left, Lu Zhishen once more returned to Shānjiǎo, once more upon the day of the reap. Once more, the monks descended from the mountain, and once more the same peculiar ritual was observed. Lu Zhishen refrained from interacting this time, instead doing his best to guess at the intentions of the abbot. After the reaping, he rushed to the abbot's side and begged him to explain this contradiction, but the abbot only smiled and touched his lips, bound to silence as they all were.  


Lu Zhishen rode for seven more years, growing into a man. After years of arduous labor, he completed his map of the south, and began to ride north, on the verge of fulfilling his promise to the emperor. All thoughts of the monks and their strange ritual escaped from his mind, until, one day, as he rode through Shānjiǎo, he was accosted by an old man.  
""Lu Zhishen!"" yelled the man. ""It's me- the farmer you spoke to! The old abbot has retired! Now's your chance to ask him!""  


Intrigued, Lu Zhishen immediately tied up his horse and went to the old abbot's cottage, where the same man he'd tried to speak to seven years earlier now sat, slowly drinking a pot of stew. Lu Zhishen bowed heavily.  
""Grandfather,"" he said. ""I have seen your rituals, but there is one question that has always eluded me: why do you allow your monks to speak on the days of the reaping?""  
The old man smiled, and gave this simple answer: ""My son, to be a good host, one must engage their guests in conversation. And as any scholar of the Buddha would tell you, reap hosting is an excellent way to accumulate Karma.""","In the Empire of China, under the reign of Emperor Taizong...",72

""But why are they laughing so much? What's so great about that?"" the other asked.

""Don't you know?"" the other ladybug began. ""Flies time when they're having fun.""",It was time for the annual bug convention,7

He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.""

His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?""

""Okay son, go ahead.""

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.""

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?""

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.""

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

""My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humor me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.""

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again.

""My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humor me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

""My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...""

His father replied.

""My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?""

""Alright father. Come closer.""

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentence.

""The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is I ate it""

And then he died.",The Story of the Pink Ping Pong Balls,0

They weren't known for being warriors, or for being artists, or for their architecture, but simply because they had the most gold, an entire mountain of it infact. But one day the powerful dragon, Sorial, swooped down on Gennemill and overtook the mountain. With Sorial sitting atop all of the gold, the Trids were unable to access their riches. 

The Trids tried everything: catapults, to hurt the dragon - didn't work. Digging through the bottom of the mountain, they weren't strong enough. Peaceful conversations? No go. They realized this dragon would not go down without a fight. 

For 15 years, the Trids trained every child born to be great warriors, similar to that of Sparta. Many died trying to become great warriors leaving only the strongest and bravest Trids for the army. Finally, they were confident, that one of these warriors could slay the Dragon. 

They first sent the fifth best warrior - Marcedius. So Marcedius climbed the mountain, camping for 3 nights before making it to the top. He finally reached the dragon, tired and sore and he brandished his sword. Sorial took one look, stood up and kicked Marcedius down the mountain to his death. 

The 4th best warrior, Bolognaius, climbed the mountain in two nights. He reached the dragon with more energy than Marcedius, confident he could win. He brandished his hammer and took a mighty seong, bopping the dragon on his big toe. Unphased, Sorial kicked Bolognauis down the mountain to his death. 

The third best warrior, was know for his archery. His name was Legotrid. He climbed to his firing point in one night, significantly further from Sorial. He shot an arrow into the mountain heights above and heard a loud screech. Confident his arrow struck Sorial dead, he climbed the mountain to regain control of the gold. The fool to his surprise, came to an angry and fully awake Dragon, who promptly kicked him down the mountain to his demise. 

The 2nd best warrior, was the largest of all Trids. His name was Gigante McSmante Stringer Bell. He climbed the mountain in only 10 hours, swiftly and calculated being sure to be extra quiet. He snuck up behind the dragon, whom was asleep, and climbed to the top of his head. He pulled out a slim dagger and raised his hands to the sky. Sorial then farted himself awake, knocking Gigante McSmante Stringer Bell to the ground at his feet. Realizing the threat, dragon kicked the trid down the mountain and all the way to West Baltimore. 

The Trids best warrior, was no warrior, but the calm and wise great Rabbi. The Trids were very religious, and their Rabbi was no easy fight. With his wisdom he was able to best even the greatest minds, once beating Bobby Fischer in a game of chess blindfolded. So the Rabbi climbed the mountain, in one week, conserving his energy for this mental bout with Sorial. He finally made it atop the mountain, no dragon in sight. He waltzed into the mountain packed up the gold and brought it down the mountain day after day until it was all gone.

 Very confused, he returned to the top of the mountain seeking out the Dragon. He found Sorial, perched at the top completely unwilling to fight. He asked the Dragon, ""Sorial, why didn't you kick me down the mountain?"" And Sorial, whom first belched a flaming burp, said calmly to him ""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids.""","In the ancient village of Gennemill, there lived the Trids...",5

post,cnumzm,2qh72,jokes,false,1565310681,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cnumzm/the_horniest_man_in_the_world/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time there was a man named Elazar ben Durdaya and he was literally the horniest man in the world. He was horny all the time. He woke up horny and went to sleep horny. Fat girls made him horny and thin girls made him horny. Tall girls and short girls, black girls and white girls.

So Elazar ben Durdaya fucked a lot of chicks. Like hundreds. Maybe thousands. So many that he got a reputation for it. That was his thing. That was what he was known for. They used to say that there wasn’t a single prostitute in the whole world that he hadn’t slept with.

Elazar ben Durdaya didn’t love women. He just loved to fuck women. He did not see women as people at all, but as objects of sexual desire and conquest. So obsessed was he with the physical act of sex that he never once opened up his heart or his soul, never once did he surf the oceans of true emotion, remaining forever locked in pure animal consciousness.

One day Elazar ben Durdaya was drinking in a tavern by the docks, just down the road from one of his favorite brothels. He had spent the entire morning in the company of two exotic slave girls and he had now come to engage his second favorite pastime — drinking.

At the table next to him were a group of sailors engaged in the most graphic and explicit locker room talk about all the prostitutes they had engaged in their days on the high seas. As each sailor spoke and the stories progressed the women became more beautiful, more expensive and the sex more outrageous. Elazar sat there, transfixed and engrossed, getting hornier and hornier, until an ancient sailor, missing an eye and a leg, finally croaked up.

“In the land of Tzur, past seven rivers is a temple to the Goddess Ishtar. The high priestess of the temple is chosen from the most beautiful women of the land, and trained from the time of her first bleeding in the arts of sex and pleasure. As a sacrifice to the goddess a man can pay the temple twenty talents of silver for one night with the priestess. Kings and Emperors have come to make this journey and all of them say that one night with the High Priestess of Ishtar in Tzur was greater than all of the pleasure with all of the other women in all of their lives.”

Suddenly Elazar ben Durdaya was seized with an intense passion and longing. In his mind’s eye he imagined this woman who had been had by Kings and Emperors. The super prostitute. The greatest fuck in the world. A sex that only the very finest and most powerful men could ever have. In his twisted, juvenile little mind, lust mixed with jealousy, horniness mixed with FOMO and soon his entire being, his entire sense of self worth and masculinity became completely tied up in the idea of having this one single woman. In his heart of hearts he began to believe that only by experiencing this fuck of all fucks could his life ever be complete, could he ever truly be a man.

Twenty talents of silver was serious money, even for a man as wealthy as Elazar ben Durdaya. But so seized was he with the need to have this priestess that he sold his lands and his slaves, and amassed the entire fortune and then more, to make the journey to the far off land of Tzur by ship, and then booked passage by camel to traverse the seven rivers until finally, after many many months he came at last to the glittering Temple of Ishtar. He sent his servants ahead with the caravan holding the twenty talents of silver to announce that he, Elazar ben Durdaya had come to offer sacrifice to the Great Goddess, a sacrifice of money and a sacrifice of seed, both to be delivered to the High Priestess, personally.

He was greeted at the gates by hundreds of dancing girls, each wave hotter, sexier, more stunning than the last, until finally the High Priestess herself walked out from the temple. She was quite literally the single most smoking hot babe than he had ever before seen in his entire life.

She led him inside the temple where naked women took off his clothes and washed him from his journey and then he was led to an ornate bedroom where the high priestess was there naked and waiting for him.

And then they began to fuck.

And not even five minutes into it and Elazar ben Durdaya realised that this was the single greatest fuck of his entire life. It was mindblowing. Perfect. Thrusting and sliding and heaving and grinding they fucked and fucked and he built closer and closer until finally, unable to hold it in any longer he let go and erupted inside her in a mind-shattering orgasmic explosion.

As he was cumming uncontrollably, synapses exploding from the pleasure, his system entirely flooded with endorphin, at his most open and most vulnerable moment — the high priestess grabbed him violently by his head and looked deep into his eyes and snarled at him a voice of pure ice:

“By the power of the Great Mother

And in the name of every one of my sisters

I curse you!

Just as your cum will never return to your cock -

So too you will never return to your God.”

And Elazar ben Durdaya freaked the fuck out.

The endorphin transformed to adrenaline and the fear response kicked in and he was seized with terror and fright. His balls shrivelled up into his stomach and he ran, naked, covered in sweat and semen, out of the temple, screaming like a madman.

He rushed outside and ran up a mountain and when he reached the summit, still heaving and panting the fear and adrenaline still flooding through him, he called out to the Sky.

“Sky! Sky! Beg mercy for me. I am a cursed man. I will never be able to return to God, my soul will be in exile for all eternity, please, please have mercy on me and pray for me, so that my soul might find redemption.”

But the Sky was offended by Elazar ben Durdaya and answered back in a huff. “Pray for you? Why would i pray for you, mere mortal? I have my own problems! For it is written that in the End of Days the sky will will be ashen and red, and choked from fire and plumes of smoke, the heavens will burn and the air will seethe. I don’t have time to pray for you. I am praying for myself!”

The sky’s rejection scorched bitter through his heart and from on top of that mountain he then looked down below at the Earth and he said:

“Earth! Earth! Beg mercy for me. I beg you, I beseech you. I have been cursed and will never be able to return to God. Please pray for me so that one day my soul might find redemption.” And the Earth retorted back in an outrage. “Pray for you? Why would I pray for you, mere mortal? I have my own problems. For it is written: At the End of Days the Earth will be dry and lifeless, and trees will wither and the animals will die. I don’t have time to pray for you. I am praying for myself.“

Crushed by his rejection from the Earth he slowly wandered down off that mountain in a bewildered daze, until he reached the ocean and he turned to the Ocean and he said:

“Ocean! Ocean! Beg mercy for me” And once again the familiar response. “Pray for you? I have my own problems. For in the End of days the oceans will boil and the seas will burn and the fish will die and the waters will be turned to blood. I don’t have time to pray for you. I am praying for myself.”

Elazar Ben Durdaya turned to the Sun and the Moon, to the Rivers and the Lakes and the Forests and the Trees, to the Birds and the Bees and everywhere he went, no matter who he asked, the answer was always the same.

“Pray for you? I have my own problems. I am praying for myself.”

Finally, exhausted, at his absolute wits end, full of self-pity and self-entitlement, realising that truly, nobody in the Universe cared about him at all, , he cried out to the heavens in a primal scream of self-realisation:

“It’s all up to me.”

And then he lay down and curled himself into foetal position and he began to cry. He cried and cried and as he cried, in his tear-soaked imagination came the faces of all the women he had ever slept with. He saw all the missed opportunities for intimacy, all the missed opportunities to know another person, to know himself.

The ice-cold voice of the high priestess rang through every corridor of his consciousness and in those moments he experienced an entire lifetime of the deepest most painful longing for intimacy, and he cried and cried and cried. In fact, he cried so much, that he cried himself to death. And as his soul escaped from his body a voice boomed out from the heavens and said:

“The repentance of Master Elazar ben Durdaya has been accepted.” And his soul, shining and pure, ascended high up into the heavens and found a place nestled at the very side of God.

Soon this story began to spread. How? Since no one was there to witness the strange death of Elazar ben Durdaya — no one knows. Nevertheless. The story spread, far and wide, told in taverns and brothels, and city squares and market places all across the two Empires, until eventually the story was told to the Great Master, Leader of all the Sages, the Prince of Israel himself.

The Great Master heard the story and when it was finished, he began to weep.

His disciples, who were gathered around him said:

“Great Master, Great Master — Why do you weep? Is this not a good story? Does it not demonstrate the power of true and honest soul searching and repentance? Does it not show God’s infinite power to forgive?”

And the Master looked at them through his tear soaked eyes and said:

“Some of us struggle our entire lives to earn our place in the World to Come. We introspect, we worry about others, we constantly wonder if we have done the right thing. We live in constant self-doubt and strive every day to become a better person. While others live their entire lives totally selfish and self-centred, seeing the world only from their own narrow and vain point of view, and only when faced with death itself do they roll into a ball and cry like a baby and all is forgiven. And to add insult to injury, God himself calls them Master!!!”

The disciples sat stunned in front of the Great Master, speechless, and then he leaned towards them, as if to tell them some great secret, and the disciples leaned in towards him and he said in barely a whisper.

“My dear disciples. You must understand. Most of the times God makes no goddamned sense.”",The Horniest Man in the World,1

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,3

post,cnqcmw,2qh72,jokes,false,1565291192,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cnqcmw/head_larger_than_the_shaft/,self.jokes,," Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a mans' penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study was incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didnt really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.

The walls are pink, the furniture is pink and the hallway is pink. The pink man tells the business men that they can use the bedroom upstairs. 
So they goes up the pink stairs down to the pink door and into the pink room, where the beds are pink the nightstands are pink and windows are a pinkish color.

Ive been following this online community for just a few years, and thoroughly enjoy it. Now all I have is some questions for you. A simple survey, but entertaining surely.

Have you seen alot of racial discrimination lately, outside people of lighter skin colors?
If you had a chance,  would you post their casual discriminatory confessions for the world to see?

Do you see children that are too tall to fit in a stroller, yet still sit in somehow? 
If you had a chance, would you scream at the mother with a visceral bark to let her child walk instead of akwardly sitting in the stroller?

Do you enjoy seeing Skits of ideas and scenarios YOU go through everyday by your favorite youtubers/vloggers/streamers?
Do you know what an ULTIMATE COMPILATION or UTIMATE REACTION VIDEOS is?

Can you guess my race/ethnicity? I will sumbit a pic if this post gets the attention of atleast 1000 people here on reddit.

How cool and relevant are reviews and explorations of some of the most disturbing, dark, secretive things humanity and other beings have created or brought here on earth?

Have you seen/would you like to see a tag-team duo of genuises explore the female prison psyche and l the psychology behind some of the violent and heinus crimes hidden behind bars?
 
If this post reaches the attention of 5000 people, I will tell you a sad story. There is some triumph, but bad luck strikes at the perfect moments for a real life man.

If you enjoy vlogs, why do you enjoy them?
How have you personally seen vlogs evovle?

#1- How do you feel about this survey?
#2- Did YOU even read this s***?
#3- These questions eat a**. That's a good thing right?

A homeless man is sitting on a bench by a lake minding his own business when all of a sudden, a little girl falls into the water. Being the only other person around, the homeless man jumps in after her to save her life, which he does.

Then, a Lamborghini rolls up by the lake and a man steps out wearing a big Gucci coat  with rings, chains and diamond jewellry covering him. ""You just saved my little girl, thank you SO much I am so grateful! Listen, I am a philanthropist, and I'm pretty stacked right now. I can give you whatever you want: a house, a car, hell I would even buy you a mansion!""

"" Your welcome sir, but all I want is £10 pounds please"" replied the homeless man. The millionaire was confused but complied with the mans request. 

Late, the homeless man went to the local travel agents and said ""hello madam, I would like to buy a holiday for £10 please"". ""£10!? Errm.. well I can look in the back store room for a leaflet but I'm not sure if there will be anything sir.""

But sure enough, right at the back of one of the cupboards, there was a dusty leaflet for an annual cruise ship around the world with the lowest price of just £10 pounds. The man gladly took a ticket for the cruise and set of for the port.

&amp;#x200B;

When he arrived on the day, he showed his ticket and was about to board the magnificent cruise liner when he was stopped by one of the porters, ""excuse me sir, we mean no offence but we don't want other guests to see you border the ship in your state, please could you come back at night so you can board when no one is around. They have quite high standards!"". Not wanting  to start an argument, the man came back at night and was taken on to the top deck of the ship.

It was magnificent,  filled with gold Rembrandt paintings on every wall, a personal gym with a huge pool and a massive ball room just like the HMS Titanic.  This was truly first class, however the homeless man wasn't staying here. He was then taken to second class, one deck below, filled with silver and impressive paintings on every wall with decently comfortable living space, this however was not where the man would stay. He was then taken down through the ship, each time the living space became smaller and smaller and much less comfortable and luxurious until he was finally taken to his compartment. A small room right at the bottom of the ship just above the hull and next to the engine room. This was not luxury at all, but the homeless man didn't have high standards and gladly took his place in the little steel bedroom.

Then the man was told, "" we don't want you to show your face in the higher decks during the day, but at night, we will let you use all of the top quality services and function rooms when no-one is around."" The man thanked him and stayed in his room for the rest of the day.

At night, the homeless man went up the ship, past the sleeping people, gradually walking through to grander and more impressive rooms each time he ascended. once he had reached the top deck, the first thing he did was go to the diving board of the pool. He got to the top and jumped in with perfect form, performing front flips and mid-air cartwheels. The security guard ( the only other man awake on that deck) was bewildered. This homeless man was a more impressive diver than most of the olympians he had seen on TV! He rushed to the captain's quarters to tell him of this amazing feat. Intrigued by what he had heard from the guard, the captain went to the pool and asked the man to dive again. He also was amazed by the skill and precision shown off by just some random hobo. He exclaimed "" Wow, amazing! I tell you what sir, on the last day of this cruise, I will get the mechanics to construct a huge diving board and you can show all the people on the cruise liner your diving talent for entertainment, they will love it!""

So for the rest of the cruise, the man stayed in his cabin at day and enjoyed the luxuries at night. Until after a few weeks, the final day was ready and the homeless man was called to the top deck in the afternoon. As he ascended he began to see this humongous ladder that was attached to a steel pole that was so large, he couldn't even see the top. So , as the captain and instructed, he started climbing. He climbed up past the highest part of the ship, he climbed past the seagulls that flew around the ship, he even climbed past the clouds in the sky going on and on. It took 2 hours of climbing this ladder until he finally reached the top, the edge of the atmosphere. Then he jumped. Even when reaching terminal velocity he kept excellent form, flipping in all directions , a sight to behold for all the passengers. He fell back through the clouds, back past the birds , back down into the ship, into the pool, through the pool, through the golden first deck, through the silver second deck, through the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and ninth decks, past the engine room, through his metal cabin and even through the reinforced steel hull of the ship. Amazingly, he swam up to the side of the ship and was hoisted aboard again. "" That was absolutely outstanding!! I can't understand how you managed to survive such a crash!"" Said the mesmerised captain . "" Well, I'm just a  homeless man you see"" he replied, ""I've been through many hardships in my life""",A homeless man saves a little girl ( very long),167

post,cnghfx,2qh72,jokes,false,1565237680,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cnghfx/a_story_about_a_man_named_yuri/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Yuri.

Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",A story about a man named Yuri,20

The first morning he is running down the beach and sees a crying woman with no arms and no legs. He asks her why she is crying and she replies ""I'm crying because I've never been hugged before."" So he picks her up and hugs her and then continues his run.

The second morning he is running down the beach again and he sees the same woman with no arms and no legs and once again she is crying. He asks her why she is crying and she replies ""I'm crying because I've never been kissed before.""  So he picks her up and plants a big kiss on her lips and then continues his run.

The next morning he is doing his same run down the beach when again he comes across the crying woman with no arms and no legs. He asks her why she is crying  and she replies ""I'm crying because I've never been fucked before."" So he picks her up and throws her in the ocean and says ""now you're fucked"" then continues his run.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”
And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”
And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.
And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”
And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”
And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.
And suddenly he has this revelation. 
And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”
And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.
And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",So a guy walks into a bar...,11

An awkward silence fills the room and the bartender decides to break it up with some small talk. He turns to the first duck and asks him

""Whats your name duck? How was your day?

The first duck replies: ""My name is Luey and my day was freaking amazing! It was the best day ever! I was in and out of Puddles all freaking day and it was great. Id do it every day for the rest of my existence if I could!""

The bartender nods his head and thinks to himself, damn that does sound like a good day for a duck. He then turns to the second duck and repeats the question: ""Hey whats your name and how was your day?""

The second duck exclaims ""My name is Huey and my day was also freaking amazing. I was in and out of Puddles all freaking day and Id do it a million times over if I could!""
