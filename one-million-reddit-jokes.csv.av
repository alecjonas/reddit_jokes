post,eze1ww,2qh72,jokes,false,1580927748,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eze1ww/the_swing_bar/,self.jokes,,"Jim's friends take him to a bar he hadn't been to before then. It was like any other joint, minus the oddly cheap booze, and the group of people huddled in the corner.

Jim asks the bartender what they're doing, and he explains that they're having a ""swing"". 

Jim and his friends venture over to view the ritual, and see an old man sitting on a bar stool in the middle of the crowd, with a long line jutting from it. When asked what's going on, a woman from the group tells Jim that everyone takes turns lugging the man upside his head, and whoever knocks him off the stool wins $50. 

The old man looked very weathered, but sat up straight with a demanding presence.

Jim wasn't very comfortable with the idea of hitting an old man, but his friends urged him on. After a good five minutes of waiting, it was his turn to swing. Coyly, he threw a weak jab at the old man's cheek. 

Sensing his hesitation, the old man urged him to hit as hard as he could. So Jim pulled his arm back once more, and propelled his fist violently into the old mans left temple, and he fell from the stool, the whole crowd silent with shock. Then the crowd suddenly roared with cheering, joyous that someone had finally knocked the old man off of his throne.

The old man slowly pulled himself off the ground, and after dusting himself off, began reaching into his wallet to reward the Jim with the promised payment, but before he could, he bet that Jim  couldn't knock him down once more. Jim was still uneasy about what he'd just done, but the encouragement from the crowd persuaded him to take the bet. 

The old man sat himself back on the stool, and prepared for the blow to come. Jim pulled back his hand, and like a plane from a runway, sent his fist into the old man's jaw. The sound was like the cracking of a whip, and it shook the souls of everyone in the bar. The old man hit the floor, throwing up the dust of the wooden boards. The crowd went ballistic, cheering for Jim and his victory. The old man took a few minutes to stand back up, and was struck with confusion. After he finally regained his composure, he payed Jim $100 for his double knockout and sat down at a table.

With his reward, Jim bought the whole crowd a round of drinks, and had a great time the rest of the night. 

That next weekend, Jim and his friends were thinking of things to do. He proposed they return to the bar, and they did. When they entered, scattered cheers filled the room, eminating from some of those who viewed his show of strength a week earlier. And in the corner was the old man, back on his stool, another great crowd around him.

One thing led to another, and Jim was in line to pummel the old man once more. When his turn had come, the old man sneered at him, proclaiming he had trained for this the past week, hoping Jim would return to the bar. Jim, uncaring of the old man's teases, swung and knocked the old man from his chair. He received his $50 and him and his friends spent it all on alcohol.

Jim capitalized on his odd talent for punching the elderly and took his friends to the bar every weekend, almost never having to pay for their drinks, using his swing money instead. He grew to enjoy hitting the old man so much he would sometimes simply go to the bar by himself. He'd even go during the week, when the bar was less busy, so there was no punchline.",The Swing Bar,12

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.
He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.
The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.

Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.
She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day,
Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

 
Why ???

As soon as the plane landed they headed for a store and bought some really outrageous shorts, shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc. 

The next morning they went to the beach dressed in their 'tourist' garb. They were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a 'drop dead gorgeous' blonde in a topless bikini came walking straight towards them. 

They couldn't help but stare. 

As the blonde passed them she smiled and said 'Good Morning Father, Good Morning Father,' nodding and addressing each of them individually, then she passed on by. 

They were both stunned. 

How in the world did she know they were priests? 

So the next day, they went back to the store and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them! Once again, in their new attire, they settled down in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine, after a little while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a different coloured topless bikini, taking her sweet time, came walking toward them. 

Again she nodded at each of them, said 'Good morning Father, Good morning Father,' and started to walk away. 

One of the priests couldn't stand it any longer and said, 'Just a minute, young lady.' 'Yes, Father?' 

'We are priests and proud of it, but I have to know, how in the world do you know we are priests, dressed as we are?' She replied, 'Father, it's me, Sister Kathleen.'",Two priests decided to go to Hawaii on vacation.,36

The stunned couple sit there in silence for a few moments, then Mr Smith squeezes his wife's hand and says ""It's all right, honey.

Then a week or so after the doctor gave them the news, Mr Smith finds himself fretful and fidgety after going to bed, and quite unable to settle down. He sighs deeply and swings his feet to the floor, and heads for the stairs. As he reaches for the light switch, he hears a noise and the light comes up to reveal Mrs Smith halfway down the stairs in a filmy nightie.

""Darling!"" he says. ""Where on earth are you going?""

""It's all right, sweetheart,"" she says, dimpling slightly. ""I was just coming down to commit suicide.""

He goes inside and sees a small office with only two people inside. Closest to the door, is an attractive young woman with long hair, lots of makeup, and complicated nails and jewelry. 

  
  ""Hi, I'm here to see the accountant."" The business owner says.   

  
  She dismissively rolls her eyes and goes back to looking at something on her phone. So the man decides to press on. Towards the back of the office is a middle-aged man sitting at a desk covered in papers. The business owner walks up to him and tries again. 

  
  ""Hi, I really need this balanced. I'm worried about my spending."" 

  
  The other man smiles and takes the papers, looking them over cautiously.   

  
  The man turns to go and says, ""Before I leave, I was just wondering about the profit margins. If I'm bringing in about 10k a week and am spending 17% of it on labor, how much should I expect to be able to put into my savings quarterly?"" 

  
  The man at the desk gives him a look and stammers out an answer. 

  
  The business owner thinks about this for a second and says, ""wait, that isn't correct at all."" 

  
  The man at the desk laughs nervously. ""Well, it's the thought that counts."" The woman in the front overhears this and shakes her head while still focusing on her phone.   
  The business owner is taken a bit aback by this. But he tries to test the accountant's knowledge further. 

  
  ""What about renovations? I've seen a notable uptick in customers recently, but I'm worried about the place not being up to snuff. How much would you think I could afford to invest into the place while still keeping the business afloat?"" 

  
  The man behind the desk scrunches his face and goes back to thinking, before answering. The business owner is perplexed. 

  
  ""That also doesn't sound correct."" 

  
  The man behind the desk puts forth a strained laugh and says, more exasperated this time, ""Well, it's the thought that counts."" This time, the woman lets out an audible sign. 

  
  Not wanting this whole endeavor to be a bust, the business owner tries one more time. 

  
  ""What about property taxes? What kind of increase would I be looking at based on those renovations, do you think?"" 

  
  The man at the desk breaks into a sweat, thinks about it, and then blurts out an answer. The business owner has had enough. 

  
  ""That's it, give me my information back! Your math is horrid! You have no clue what you're talking about and I'm going to take my business elsewhere!"" 

  
  The man behind the desk loses it at this. 

  
  ""LISTEN, BUDDY. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE YELLING AT ME! I'VE TOLD YOU REPEATEDLY NOW!"" He immediately points at the woman near the entrance who is now looking up from her phone and staring straight at them.

""Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke.""

So the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

The bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""Hey you two!"" he shouts. ""Stop making spectacles of yourselves!""

When Greta finally visited Argentina, we were ready for her. 

Everything was dark around the seaport, only illuminated by her own ship and our torches; we welcomed her with our finest delicacies, ""asado argentino"", ""mate"" and ""dulce de leche artesanal"", which she rejected.

""Sorry, Greta"" the Diplomat said ""as you know, technology takes time to be imported here. and it will be at least a year before the first units arrive""

Greta then asked about hotels: ""sorry Greta, our five-star hotels have closed, as they can't provide the required amenities until the new grid is up and running; but we have set up tents for you and your entourage in Hilton's yard, so you can at least reminisce about how badly we had it before you came along""

Greta was almost in tears, but she muttered a last request: ""How are we going to get there? Do you have electric cars or something?""

""Sorry Greta, but our country is too indebted to pay for that luxury, but we can let you choose between our national ""pingo"", and ""yama"" and the brasilian ""asna""; you'll find them parked on the street and choose whichever youy like.

Greta ran to see what technological marvels the argentinians had prepared for her, and found a pony, a llama, and a donkey, as well as bicycles for her entourage. She turned around to face the Diplomat, completely enraged.

""How DARE you! Is this the way to treat a child?!""

""Well, we can turn on our old grid again, but let me warn you, everyone is listening.""

""I don't care! Get me a tesla, and a room in a hotel.""

""Our government doesn't have teslas, you will have to ask around for someone who owns one and beg them to take you there""

""Ok, turn on your old grid, I really don't care about the crowd listening.""

And so and within an hour, the very polluting grid was running again, and Greta could finally see that a hundred cameras powered by people running on threadmills had been recording her from across the street, and a couple of solar drones were keeping their distance, but recording her every word from above.

""You didn't tell me about the cameras and the drones!"" Greta complained.

""Well, Greta, I told you everyone was listening; those drones belong to a certain nordic journalist who was interested in you, the treadmills were sent by an american lady to power a jewish ceo's cameras, and yet another CEO was kind enough to launch 80 satellites a few days ago so everything could be broadcasted around the globe; You have united the world against a common enemy, and it's all thanks to you, Greta""

""Now get on the donkey because we promised the brasilians we would should them an ass riding a donkey in exchange to take us all in because this country went down the drain before you were even born.""",[mediumt] You reap what you sow,2

Through the window, she sees a rowboat approaching. One of its occupants yells through a megaphone that she has to get out of there, but once again she refuses. “No. God will save me.” The boat sails away.

The water rises even more, and the woman has to climb out the window on to the roof. A helicopter flies overhead and lowers down a rope ladder. Once again, she is urged to evacuate. However, the woman will not be convinced. “NO! GOD WILL SAVE ME!” After several minutes, the pilot’s efforts prove futile, and he has no choice but to fly away.

But the water doesn’t stop rising, and the woman is encased in water. Everything fades away into darkness.

The woman’s eyes flicker open, and she finds herself at the Pearly Gates, with God in front of her. She falls prostrate before Him and cries, “I...I had my faith in you all this time...why didn’t you save me???”

“Alright bud, you’re only getting in today if you can make me laugh, so why don’t you tell me about how you died”

The man looked at Saint Peter and said

“Oh man it was awful, I was absolutely SURE my wife was having an affair, so I left work early and came home to catch her in the act! When I got home, sure as shit there she was naked in bed! I looked all over the apartment but I couldn’t find the guy anywhere so I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and there he was! Hanging over the edge by his fingertips! I ran inside, grabbed a hammer, and started smacking his hands and fingers with it! He finally let go and fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so I ran inside and grabbed the refrigerator and heaved it over the balcony down on top of him, crushing him and killing him! But the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and I died.”

Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let this poor soul in.

Another man came walking up to the pearly gates and Saint Peter told this man the same thing, that in order to get in he had to make St. Peter laugh. The second guy told him about how he died.

“Well St. Peter, it was awful, I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th story apartment when a flock of birds came out of nowhere and startled me! I fell over the railing but managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below me. All of a sudden, some maniac came outside and started hitting my hands with a hammer until I let go! Luckily, I landed in some bushes but then this guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!”

Saint Peter chuckled again, let the second man into heaven, and decided he could really start to enjoy his job. A third man came walking up to the pearly gates.

Saint Peter gave his speech to this third man and then told him:

“Tell me about the day you died”

“Oh man Saint Peter you’re never gonna believe this! Alright so picture this...I’m butt naked hiding in a refrigerator...”","It was getting crowded in Heaven one day, so Saint Peter decided for one day to only accept people who could make him laugh.",204

It was really nice, and surprisingly secluded for the area. Nobody was around but a bunch of seagulls. Terns, actually, my wife corrected me.

We find a spot to sit and hang out for ten minutes or so, and after nobody comes by, she surprises me by pulling out a bag of weed. I never go in for such things but lately she's been dabbling in the dank arts so I figured I'd join her. This was the biggest purchase she'd made to date, and apparently there was a sale or something so that a dime bag was only a nickel.

I take the bag from her and then set it down next to me for a minute so I can get situated with all the equipment and whatnot, and just my luck, one of those stupid gulls swoops in and takes off with the whole bag.

We chased it a bit, more out of worry for the bird than anything else,  but it didn't take long for the gull to get out of our airspace.

We could only watch as it landed atop the rocks and rejoined its friends, who eagerly started eating the whole bag. 

This was about 7:30 or so, and the sun was quickly departing, but we could tell from where we were sitting that there was no tern unstoned.",A Secluded Beach Spot,5

A hitman named Arthur (nicknamed Artie) was recently hired to eliminate someone. His contractor offered him $10,000,000 to do this dirty deed but Artie said “No I know this person with a personal vendetta. I can’t accept any money for this because *I* want this. His contractor says “Well you know I have to pay you something, right?” So Artie responds “Alright fine I’ll take a dollar.” “Done” says the contractor. So for a week Artie follows this person for a couple weeks and finds out the routine this person follows. Artie found out his target goes to a supermarket every Monday morning. Artie decided to strike on week two. He enters the supermarket equipped with a garrote wire. He approaches the target and eliminates them. However, he noticed another person saw him commit the act, standing in disbelief. Artie thinks to himself “Oh no there can’t be any witnesses” so Artie take the bystander out as well. It was at this point the manager heard the commotion and went to investigate. “Crap.” Artie thought as he knew he’d have to take this person out as well. By the time he takes out the manager the cops arrive and promptly arrest him. The headline on the newspaper the next day read “Artie chokes three for a dollar at local supermarket”",Artie the hitman,1

He placed a want ad to hire a replacement but as neither the pay nor the working conditions were very good, some time passed without any response. 

One evening he heard a knock at the door and answered it to discover an armless dwarf standing there.  The dwarf said he was there for the job but Quasi couldn't see how he could ring the bells without arms.  The dwarf had Quasi take him to the top of the bell tower amongst all the bells and said ""Watch, I'll show you!""

The dwarf stepped back from the largest of the bells and ran straight for it, slamming into with his face! ""DONG!!""  The dwarf gave his head a shake, stepped back again, and ran into the bell again with his face. ""DONG!!"" A third time, the dwarf stepped back, ran at the bell, and missed, falling out the tower and splat, onto the cobblestones below.

At the bottom of the tower, Quasi met with the police to report what had happened.  ""Did you know this dwarf?"" asked the police officer.

Quais replied, ""No, but his face rings a bell.""

Two weeks later, Quasi is at home and hears a knock at the door.  Answering, he finds another dwarf, this one carrying a massive ornate hammer.

""I'm sorry,"" Quasi says ""but there was a terrible accident and I'm not looking to hire anyone right now.""

""You don't understand,"" says the dwarf, ""I am the brother of the dwarf who died.  If you would allow it, I would like to take this hammer, a family heirloom, up to the bell tower and ring the bell where my brother last was before he died.""

Quasi agrees and the two of them climb to the top of the bell tower.  The dwarf approaches the bell, and lifts the hammer above his head.  The weight of the hammer was just too much however, and the dwarf stumbles backwards with it, and out through a tower window, and splat on the cobblestones below.

At the bottom of the tower, Quasi once again meets with the police to report what had happened.  ""Well,"" asks the police officer, ""Did you know THIS dwarf?""
