However, there was one thing that bothered Bobby.  Whenever he would perform oral sex on his wife, Spot would come into the room and stare at Bobby.  Sometimes, he would tilt his head to the side as dogs often do with a curious look.  Bobby never shooed him away as it was the only thing that Spot did to annoy him.

In the afterlife, he would be able to communicate with Spot like never before.  The two were inseparable in heaven.  They laughed and talked for days on end.  Many years later, Bobby had to finally ask.  ""Spot, Why did you always come and stare at me and the wife whenever I was pleasuring her?""  Spot looked at him, and spoke in a soft voice.  ""Bobby, it is the only annoying thing that you ever did to me in my mortal body.

A man walks into a bar and notices a large jar on the counter filled to the brim with cash, $50's, $20's. Must be a good few $thousand in the jar. The guy orders a drink and asks about the jar on the counter. ""Oh that's for anyone who can beat the three challenges."" ""Ok, what's the three challenges"", says our guy.

""First you see that guy in the corner?"", the barman points to an absolute unit of a fella standing in the corner, ""That's Big Dave, you gotta knock him out with one punch.""

Then the barman points to a trapdoor on the floor, it's chained shut. ""Next, my pitbull is in the basement, he's a big old angry bastard of a dog, head down there, pull out one of his teeth and bring it back to me.""

""And then finally, see the old lady sat over at that table? That's Doris, she's 94, all she wants before she goes is to have the best, most passionate sex she's ever had. She's not long for this Earth, she needs the D and she wants it hard. Slam her bones like your riding a mechanical bull. You do all three of those challenges and this here jar is yours.""

Fucking easy says our guy. He orders 5 shots of whiskey and downs them, one after the other in quick succession. He stands up, walks over to Big Dave and SMACK, punches him on the chin with the biblical quickness and down goes Big Dave. Out cold.

Now for the next one, he thinks. He walks over to the trapdoor which is being buffeted up and down by the snarling vicious dog. He quickly removes the chain, pushes the dog down the steps and runs down the stairs, slamming the trapdoor shut after him as he goes.

Five minutes goes by, there's loud snarling and tearing noises, our man screaming out in pain.

Ten minutes goes by, the sounds of smashing glass and furniture being thrown around, more screams, now some moans.

After fifteen minutes the trapdoor opens and our guys steps out, he's bleeding, he's covered in bites, his clothes are torn.

He walks up to the bar and says, ""Right then, where's this old lady that needs a tooth pulled?""",A man walks into a bar,44

“Hold the club gently, just like you’d hold your husband’s *thing*.”

The wife listens carefully to the pro’s advice, takes a swing, and THUMP. The ball goes straight down the fairway . . . about 15 ft.

Suddenly, the lion grabs her by the collar of her jacket and tries to pull her inside to slaughter her, under the eyes of her screaming parents.

The biker jumps off his Harley, runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch. Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back letting go of the girl, and the biker brings the girl to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly. A reporter has watched the whole event.

The reporter addressing the Harley rider says, “Sir, this was the most gallant and bravest thing I've seen a man do in my whole life.”

The Harley rider replies, “Why, it was nothing, really. The lion was behind bars. I just saw this little kid in danger, and acted as I felt right.”

The reporter says, “Well, I'll make sure this won't go unnoticed. I'm a journalist, you know, and tomorrow's paper will have this story on the front page. So, what do you do for a living, and what political affiliation do you have?”

The biker replies ""I'm a U.S. Marine, a Republican and I’m voting for Trump.""

The journalist leaves.

The following morning the biker buys the paper to see if it indeed brings news of his actions, and reads, on the front page:

“U.S. MARINE ASSAULTS AFRICAN IMMIGRANT &amp; STEALS HIS LUNCH”",The Biker and the Lion,15

His older, strong-armed and favoured son, Jedediah worked hard every day, getting up extra early every morning to milk the cow before dutifully doing the rest of his chores. 

The farmers delicious milk became very popular around the area with neighbours often walking miles in for a glass and some conversation. So, the farmer decided to buy another milk cow so he could start making some money. 

The farmer realised that by God, this was a good time to get his younger, bookish son, David to start helping on the farm and so tore his book off him one morning and sent him out to milk the new cow.

He was somewhat unsurprised, but nonetheless disappointed when David came back shortly after with a full pail of inadequacy. The milk was thin and bland and lacked the rich flavour and creamy consistency of Jed’s milk. With no more than a grimace of disgust, the farmer tipped out the milk in front of his son and told him to do better tomorrow.

After two weeks of this with no improvement in the milk David was bringing in, the farmer called his sons one morning and asked Jed, with a ruffle of his hair, if he would bring David out and show him how to milk a cow like a man. Jed reluctantly consented and went out with David, while the farmer sat and waited on the porch with a delicious glass of warm milk from the previous morning.

Before long, David trudged back to the house and announced, “I think I know what’s wrong now, sir.” 

“Well what is it?” asked the farmer, through a creamy mouthful of milk, beaming with admiration over David’s shoulder at Jed who was still vigorously milking.

David gestured behind him and said, “That’s a bull.”",An aging farmer decided it was time for his youngest son to start pulling his weight around the farm.,213

He had been having trouble around the house and had a few scary falls. His son begged him to stay at his family's house, because he felt that this was the best plan.
""Dad, please! Stay with us! I've heard those places are horrible!"" His father says ""No way, son. You have your family to care for and I won't be a bother. I would rather find a nice place and have a new adventure!"" 
After a bit of back and forth, his son acquiesced and offered to take him around to make sure that his old man found a nice place to live out his days.
They went to 7 different facilities over the next few weeks before settling on the perfect place. The orderlies were kind and caring, the staff seemed content, the residents seemed happy. 
""This is the one, son. I can feel it!"" the father said.
""Are you sure, pop? The wife and I are happy to have you! Don't you want to sleep on it?""
His father's mind was made up, and despite his age, his resolve was rather strong. He decided to sign paperwork and move in that very day.
That night, his son was anxious and worried and barely slept a wink. The following morning, he got a call from his father. 
""SON! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!!!"" 
His son is perplexed...
""The dinner was the best I've had since your mother passed 12 years ago! Everyone here is so friendly and kind! The bed was so comfortable that I slept the whole night and that hasn't happened in years!""
His son was overjoyed! ""This is great, pop! I'm so glad you're happy! I guess I can stop worrying about you now!""
His father was so happy, he hadn't heard him with such vim and vigor in years.
""Son, I haven't told you the best part yet! I slept so well and was so content that I woke up with an erection so firm that I thought I was in my twenties!""
""TMI, pop...""
""Seriously son!"" he continued, ""the most amazingly beautiful orderly with the most fantastic rack I think I've ever seen woke me up for a sponge bath, saw my erection and gave me the best blowjob I think I've ever had!!!!""
""Holy shit, pop! This place sounds amazing!"" his son retorted.
""I told you this place was for me,"" he said. 
He rushed his son off the phone after sharing his wonderful news because he couldn't wait to see how the first full day would go. His son was finally able to relax, knowing his dad was in a good place.
His phone rang a few hours later and he saw it was his dad, and couldn't wait to hear the next happy update.
""SON, YOU HAVE TO GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!!""
The son was perplexed! ""What happened? You had such a beautiful night and morning! You even got a hummer from that orderly!?!?!""
His dad said ""well I was walking down the hallway, thinking about my wonderful morning. I tripped over my own feet and fell! I saw this big, strong orderly coming to help and I tried to wave him off. You know how I hate to be a bother, but he came over anyway. When I tried to get up, he ripped my pants down and fucked me up the ass!""
His son thought for a minute, and finally responded. ""Pop, if you taught me anything, you taught me that you have to take the good with the bad. You got a blowjob this morning!""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

""If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says,"" I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth"".

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound"".

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, ""The sound is right behind that door"". The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door"".

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

Sally thought about this for a bit and decided - what the heck, she could do that, as she really wanted a date for Wednesday Movie night.

Everything went well with the date and the next Tuesday Sally asked Bob if he would take her to the movie again this week but Bob said he was sorry he could not because he was going to the Wednesday Night movie with another resident Jane.

The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so they are all sentenced to death!

However, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to appeal their sentences down to 20 lashes each of the whip.

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: ""As it is my first wife's birthday today, she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.""

The German was first in line; after thinking for a bit he said, ""Please tie a pillow to my back."" This was done, but after only 10 lashes the whip had shredded the pillow. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying in pain.

The Englishman was next up. After watching the German in horror he asked, ""Please tie two pillows to my back."" This time it took 15 lashes, but once again the pillows were shredded, and the Englishman was led away bleeding and whimpering in pain.

The Irishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from the most beautiful part of the world I have ever seen. Because of this, you may have two wishes!""

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Irishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Not only are you an honorable man from a beautiful island, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with admiration. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish?""

Any one of you could, no matter your path as a medical doctor, suddenly be faced at some time with a victim of a violent crime trying to hold his intestines in with limited success. Again, if you are to succeed in your medical practice you must face such carnage with utter calm.

""If you are to continue in this class, and consequently this medical school, I need each of you to come to the front of the room and place a finger in the cadaver's rectum,"" the professor did exactly that. ""And then lick your finger, put it in your mouth and suck on it like you're dining alone."" He put a finger in his mouth, and pulled it out with a loud smack of his lips.  


The students were horrified. Slowly, they began filing to the table at the head of the room. Each one stuck a finger up the cadaver's butthole, and cringed in horror as they put that same finger in their own mouth. They returned to their seats, scarred for life.

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""  

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.  

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.  

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

Not really what I'm used to, but I decided to give it a try. I came across a fan-fiction based on the Harry Potter series and started there.

I couldn't believe it. It turned out to be really arousing, and actually quite entertaining. Page after page I was getting closer and closer to my climax, yet I couldn't stop reading and found myself getting really tied into the story. 

Every sentence and every paragraph in every chapter had me so turned on. Until a chapter that took place in a cell in Azkaban, where Harry started passionately kissing his godfather. My libido extinguished immediately, and all sexual desire gone. I just couldn't continue. It was too absurd.

Generally, the people would respond negatively and she would wander off, but occasionally someone would nod and there would be a quick exchange of money for something she carried in her bag. The couple assumed she was selling drugs and debated calling the cops, but since they didn’t know for sure they just continued to watch her.

After a couple of weeks the wife asked, “Honey, have you ever noticed that she only goes up to people with boom boxes and other electronic devices?”

He hadn’t and said so. Then she said, “Tomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what she’s really doing.”

Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. “Well, is she selling drugs?” she asked excitedly.”

“No, she’s not.” he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.

The carpenter replied with a humble tone ""Its a special gift for you from us humans, o great king of the jungle!"" The lion was easily flattered and decided to enter the wooden cage. As soon as he entered in, you guessed it, the carpenter locked the door. Then he proceeded to tell his son to bring a bucket full of boiling water.

After about 30 minutes, the son informs his fater that the bucket is ready. The carpenter says outloud ""Bring the Bucket!"" and proceeds to carefully climb the nearest tree with the bucket and pour it down on the lion. Now the lion is screaming with pain and his skin is burnt. The carpenter opens the cage after this and the lion runs back into the wild, cursing and screaming.

Now they start packing their tools since they've had enough for the day. They were almost complete packing up when they hear roars of lions and they realize the imminent danger and quickly climb up the nearest tree.

As soon as they finish climbing, they see 3 lions along with the burnt lion all gathered around the tree, jumping and trying to reach them. After a few failed attempts, the lions decide be creative and climb one on the top of another. The previous victim lion stood on the ground while the other 3 stood on his back. Now they can clearly reach the carpenter and his son.

At this moment, a lightbulb goes off the carpenter's head and he says in a loud and commanding voice to his son ""Bring the Bucket!""

Upon hearing this, the lion standing at the bottom immediately lets out a scared roar and struggles to run away. This disturbs the balance of all above him and they fall down with a large thud.

He was surprised she’d ask such a question at her age, but thought if she’s old enough to ask, she’s old enough to get a straight answer. He wouldn’t shirk his responsibility.

Steeling himself to leave nothing out, he proceeded to describe for her all the variations of human sexuality he could conjure, careful to impress upon her the joys and responsibilities of intercourse and procreation.

When finally Grandpa was done pontificating, the little girl stood frozen, as though nailed to the spot, and looked at him with her mouth open, eyes wide in amazement.

Seeing she was overwhelmed, he asked what caused her sudden curiosity. 

His granddaughter shook off her reverie and replied, “Grandma says dinner will be ready in a couple of secs.”",Oh Grandpa,143

As they neared the town they stepped out of the jungle into an open field and standing in the center of the opening stood a large mangoe tree covered in ripe fruit. Two of the boys sprang ahead mouths watering, but the youngest boy snatched them by their arms and yelled ""Stop!""

Shocked, his older brothers glared back at him. Confidently the young boy said ""Brothers, ladies first!"" 

With a smug grin the heavy old lady shoved her way past and into the field.

The oldest brother now infuriated grabbed his younger brother and growled ""What is wrong with you!? That old hag has done nothing, but torment us. Why would you show her any respect? Let alone treat her like a lady?""

Standing proud the youngest brother calmly replied, ""Brothers, our grandfather has raised us as gentlemen. He told us no matter what, we should treat ladies as such...""

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance - particularly in the ﬂower and jewelry applications,which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 then uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as NBA 5.0, NFL 3.0 and Golf Clubs 4.1.

Conversation 6.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. Please note that I have tried running Nagging 5.3 to ﬁx these problems, but to no avail.

What can l do?

Signed,

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Please enter the command: I thought you loved me.xml, download Tears 6.2 and be sure to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If those applications work as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.

However, please remember that overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5. Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Please note that Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta.

Whatever you do. DO NOT under any circumstances install Mother-ln-Law 1.0 (lt runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources.)

ln addition, please do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. This is an unsupported application and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot install new applications quickly.

You might consider  additional software to improve your memory and performance. We recommend Cooking 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7.
