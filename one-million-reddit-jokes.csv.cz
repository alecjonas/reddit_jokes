On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, the lot. ""Love me hard and long or climb the ladder to success"" she flirted.

The next day a police officer finds James and Thomas at the local pub. After explaining the incident the officer asks the two men to come to the mortuary to identify the body. At the mortuary the officer says that he will take them in one by one. 

Officer: ""Look, we found the body in Freddie's bed so we are pretty sure it is him. We just need you to confirm it. We will be in and out as quick as possible.""

James agrees to go first, enters the room and the police officer uncovers the body. 

James: ""oh, he's very badly burnt. I'm not sure I can confirm if that is freddie. Could you turn him over please?""

The officer agrees and turns over the body. 

James: ""No, I'm sorry but that's not Freddie.""

The officer is a bit perplexed by this but takes the man at his word none the less. 

Officer: ""Okay James, thanks for your assistance. Can you send in Thomas in on the way out?""

Thomas enters the room and the officer once again uncovers the body.

Thomas: ""oh, he's very badly burnt. I'm not sure I can confirm if that is freddie. Could you turn him over?""

The officer agrees once again and turns over the body. 

Thomas: ""No, I'm sorry but that's not Freddie.""

""Awesome, when do-"" the actor starts before being interrupted by 2 large security guards. They pick him up by the arms and legs and shuffle off-stage. They carry him outside, where a Limo waits. The driver gets out and, before opening the actor's door for him, asks him one question.

""What's the line?"" the driver asks.

""Hark, for yonder art thou cannon!"" the actor replies.

""Great,"" the driver smiles. He opens the door and the security guards shove the actor in. The drive is very long and the actor has no idea where he is going. He needs the job, so he keeps his mouth shut. 4 hours later, the Limo stops and the driver opens the door. The actor gets out and sees that he is on the coast. A helicopter is on a landing platform, its blades spinning wildly. The helicopter pilot rushes across the platform and yells over the sound of the blades, ""What's the line?""

""Hark, for yonder art thou cannon!"" the actor yells back.

""Good,"" the pilot smiles at him. He grabs the actor by the arm and leads him to the helicopter. They fly across the entire ocean, but the actor still does not ask where they are going. Land comes into view and, soon, they are landing on top of an Opera House. The pilot lets the actor out and takes off a moment later. A man in a fine suit approaches the actor and asks him, ""What's your line?""

""Ummm....Hark, for yonder art thou cannon!"" the actor responds. 

""Exquisite,"" the man smiles. He grabs the actor and they begin to run. They enter a staircase from the top of the Opera House and begin their descent. Soon, the actor begins to hear the sounds of Opera. The night is already in full swing. The two men burst from the stairwell and the actor sees that they are backstage. Dozens of stagehands appear and begin to strip the actor of his clothes and dress him in a fancy costume. 

A woman approaches the actor, who has now been fully dressed. ""What's your line?"" she asks with a French accent. 

""People keep asking me that,"" the actor scoffs. ""But it's 'Hark, for yonder art thou cannon.'""

The woman grins and leads him towards the stage. The Opera is in its final act. Suddenly, the woman shoves the actor in the back and he stumbles out onto the stage, where thousands of eyes become fixed upon him. The room goes quiet. The thundering sound of a cannon breaks the silence, causing the actor to jump in surprise.

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.
The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""","The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the A90 near Stonehaven recently,",144

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.
After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

-Is it really made out of dogs? That's very odd.

-Now sister, 'do not judge, or you too will be judged'. People around the world have different customs that we find strange. And they feel the same way about ours.

-I'm sorry, I guess you are right. But still... Eating a dog...

-I tell you what. I think we should embrace the local culture. We should try some.


They visited the vendor and ordered two portions 'with all the fixings' as it said on the menu. They walked to a nearby park, sat on a bench and started unwrapping their packages.

-I still can't believe I am doing this...
 
-We must start getting more into modern things. And think about the story we'll got to tell back home.

Most people still came away without even a minor burn or were smart enough to get their feet off the ground once they could feel it was getting hot. As far as people could search, nobody with shoes realized in time.

South Korea, worried about the incident recurring, closes its borders, turning away any and all flights scheduled to come in or out. A shipment of shoes from elsewhere could not be scheduled for another week.

Again, no response except from Jose :""Abraham Lincoln, 1863.""
The teacher snapped at the class, ""Class, you should be ashamed! Jose, who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do!""
She heard a loud whisper: ""Screw the Mexicans!""
""Who said that? "" she demanded.
Jose put his hand up. ""Jim Bowie, 1836.
At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.""
The teacher glared and asked, ""All right! Now, who said that?""
Again, Jose answered, ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""
Now furious, another student yelled, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!""
Jose jumped out of his chair waving his hand and shouting to the teacher, ""Bill Clinton to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""
The teacher fainted, and as the class gathered around her on the floor, someone said, ""Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble now!""
Jose whispered, ""Saddam Hussein, 2003.""

Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.""

On his way, he became slightly lost but eventually came upon a plateau fitting the description. He stood on the edge and proceeded to make the clicking sounds. A few moments later, a woman from the tribe arrived. He smiled and began to introduce himself, but the woman suddenly started flirting and rubbing herself all over him. 

Unsure what to do next, the anthropologist froze, but a few moments later, the translator appeared and shooed her away.

""This is the wrong plateau, my friend,"" he laughed. ""This is a meeting place for prostitutes!""

The toilets were at the other end of the campus and I was alone because the teacher taking the after school supervision went to get his books. I obviously didn’t just want to lay a pile on the floor so I was desperately holding it in because the teacher had told me to stay there while he fixed the projector across the campus. It was then that I saw the fire extinguisher. I took the top off of it because it was special European type that you can just take the top off and has a really large hole. So I shat in the hole. All the while considering if this would count in my shit-in-the-urinal count. After I was done the teacher got back into the classroom about 5 minutes later. He didn’t suspect a thing.
Fast forward two days. Me and my class (there are 753 people in my class) were in the science lab (where I had done the deed) and we were experimenting with Bunsen burners and the effects of fire on spinning rotors and going through safety regulations. When the teacher said “don’t worry I can put out the fire with this fire extinguisher if anything happens” I knew something bad would happen

They all get excited.  Civilization, finally!  

They all decide that one man should go and explore the cottage, see if anyone is home.  So one of them walks up to the front door and knocks.  No answer.  He finds put the door is open and let's himself in.

The smell that hit his nose was absolutely disgusting.   The house was was full of junk and trash, and oddly enough, there was a huge pile of corn in the corner of the room.

""Instead of having sex with this hag, I'll use the corn"" 

He grabs a cob of corn, and begins to 'use it'. The lady has the time of her life.  After he is done, he throws the corn out of the window.

St Peter looks at the zebra and says ""you know, that is a very good question,  I have no idea though I can guarantee God would know the answer.""
The zebra simply nods and walks into heaven.

A few days later the same zebra is strolling around and notices God. Thinking this the perfect opportunity he approaches God and asks ""Hello God, when I got here St Peter told me i could ask any one question and get an answer but he didnt know it. So I'll ask you now, am I a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?""
God looks down and after a few moments of silence a voice booms ""YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE.""
Perplexed, the zebra simply says thank you and walks away.

Later that same day the zebra runs into St Peter who stops him to ask ""you know, ever since the other day, I haven't been able to get that question out of my head. Did you ever find out if you were a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?""
The zebra looks at him and shrugs saying he asked God and repeated the answer of ""you are what you are""
So St. Peter thinks for a second and says ""Oh! So you are a white zebra with black stripes then!""
""If you were a black zebra with white stripes... it would be you is what you is.""",So a zebra dies and goes to heaven.,19

“Calculating” said the AI. This time though it didn’t give a response immediately. In fact it took a whole day of processing before finally printing out a paper saying “insufficient resources, need more for the computation”

“Ok we’ll help out!” Said the leaders of america. And they provided the AI with all of the advanced tech America can offer. They asked the question again.

“Calculating” responded the AI. But still, it responded “insufficient resources. Still need more for computation”

“Ok we’ll also pitch in!” Said the other leaders of the world. Providing their tech and networks to the AI.

""You can have me, right here, right now."" She gestures to a door he hadn't noticed before and continues, ""Or, you can carry on to success.""

The traveller is a little nonplussed, a little flattered about being propositioned like this. Alas he remembers the wedding ring on his finger and frowns. ""I suppose I'll carry on to success?""

She smiles again and with the wave of her hand, the door slides open, revealing a modest but nonetheless quite lovely vestibule. He leaves his suitcase at the lobby, and almost as though in a trance, wanders through.

Inside, he sees a table, or more accurately, a polished slab of white marble. Lying atop the marble is another lady, even more attractive than the first, clad more than a little immodestly. She slides over to meet his awestruck gaze and offers him a dazzling smile, her red lips parting to reveal a perfect row of teeth. She looks at him with eyes that seem to flicker between shades of the most exquisite turquoise gems and with a sensual finger, unbuttons a shirt button.

The traveller musters up a queasy smile and attempts a wave.

""You can take me, right here right now. You can do whatever you like to me, baby."" She gestures towards a door at the end of the corridor. ""Or,"" she whispers, ""you can carry on to success.""

Now trembling uncontrollably, the traveller ignores the visceral scream inside urging him to stay with this goddess, and manages a mumbled apology, avoiding eye contact and somehow making it to the door despite being partially blinded by the cold beads of sweat now streaming down his brow.

Into the next room he goes, and the next, and the next. Each room more palatial, each girl defying all possible expectations of beauty, each girl offering themselves, each girl offering him to carry on to success.

Each time, the traveller promises himself to stop at the next room, but now he is positively broken, spellbound at the possibilities of what may greet him should he continue.

""Carry on to success,"" he breathes. It has become his mantra. 

With a deep breath, he stumbles through a door and gasps as it slams shut behind him. He surveys his surroundings and cannot help but be perplexed when he sees the yellowing walls, the flickering fluorescent bulb hanging above his head at a lopsided angle.

His investigation is interrupted by a phlegmy cough and he turns around.

Standing in front of him is a beast of a man, wearing nothing but a greasy cloth, and the rug of hair adorning everywhere but his scalp.

Reeling at the stench that permeates his nostrils, he coughs, ""what the fuck is this?"" 

The man puts a finger on the traveller's mouth, and with the other hand, strokes his cheek. ""Shhhh, baby, it's okay, it's okay."" A toothy grin follows and he pushes the traveller on to the filthy mattress in the centre of the cell. ""I'm Cess.""",A traveller enters a mysterious looking hotel and is greeted by a rather attractive girl sitting behind the check in desk.,38

The poor thing devoured them in moments. Since she needed a good clean up I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't use because you say they are too tight. I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't use because I don't have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't use just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't use because someone at work has a pair the same.""

At that instant the Atheist cried out: ""Oh my God!""
All at once time stood still. The bear froze. The forest was silent. As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky: ""You deny my existence for all of these years, teach others I don't exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Why do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?""
The atheist looked directly into the light, ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as a believer now, but perhaps could you make the BEAR a believer?""
""Very well,"" said the voice. The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together and bowed his head and spoke:
""Lord, bless this food, which I am about to receive from thy bounty , Amen.""","One day an atheist was taking a walk through the woods. ""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers!

They are happy to see each other, the difference in wealth has never been an issue between them.

""How are you nephew?"" say Mel “Have you seen my new Jag?""

""My that’s a fancy car, so let me ask you, what kind of stereo do you have in it?"" Asks Ronnie.

""Why I have a blaupunkt 3500, best you can buy"" 

'Oh"" says Ronnie, ""You know, that’s actually last year’s model, this year they came out with the 5500, which is what I have""

'Huh"" says Mel, ""Well, check out my all Corinthian leather seats""

""Well"" says Ronnie, ""Corinthian leather was good a few years ago, but I just had Vulcan leather put in mine, check em out""

'Huh"" says Mel, ""Well, check out my new Bridgestone 6000 tires, cool eh?”

""Gee"" say Ronnie, ""You should talk to your mechanic, they recalled them, and replaced them with the 8800's, like mine""

And then Ronnie adds, ""So let me ask you Mel, do you have a bed in the back of your car?""

""Wha?"" Says Mel, ""No I don't have a bed in the back of my car.""

""Well"" Says Ronnie, ""Check it out - king sized bed in the back seat of my 2003 Toyota""

And Mel gets out of his car, goes up to Ronnie’s and leans in and sure enough there is a massive King sized bed in the back of Ronnie’s car. He looks at the outside of the car, and its small, look inside and there is a king sized bed.

'Huh?' thinks Mel

Just then the light turns green and Ronnie says ""Ok, see ya"" and drives off.

And this drives Mel just about crazy. He starts telling all his friends and family about the king sized bed in the back of Ronnie’s car and they all think he has gone mad. 
So Mel starts calling auto shops and asking if they could put a king sized bed into the back of his jag, and they all just laugh at him and hang up on him. But Mel soldiers on, he starts calling auto shops further and further away until finally he calls ""Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing"" shop in Watsonville California.

""Hello"" Says the guy answering the phone, ""Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing, Dave speaking, what I can do for you?"" 

""Hi"" Says Mel, ""This is going to sound odd, but can you put a bed into the back of my Jag?""

""You bet” Says Dave ""Bring it in on Tuesday and we'll get that in there for you""

Finally! Mel is delighted and he immediately drives from Toronto Ontario to Watsonville California, (about 40 hours of driving I might add) gets the work done, pays the guy, and drives home as happy as a clam.

Months go by. And finally, Mel gets his chance. He is driving along and he sees Ronnie’s 2003 Toyota parked by the side of the road. Mel stops his car jumps out and goes over to Ronnie’s, But, the windows are a little steamed up, there is a gentle rocking motion of the car, and Mel is a little concerned with should he disturb him or not. So Mel waits a couple of minutes until he can't stand it anymore and taps the window. Nothing happens. He taps it again only a little louder. A few seconds go by and then Ronnie rolls down the window, a little bit of steam escapes from the car, and there is Ronnie wearing nothing but a bath towel. 

""Hey Ronnie!"" Says Mel “Guess what? I got a bed in the back of my car! Just like you, come on check it out""

'Oh' Says Ronnie, ""You got me out of my shower just to tell me that?""",So my rich brother in law bought a Jag. And one day while he was at a stop light,105

The priest tells the sinner, “You are forgiven. Go out and say three Hail Mary’s.”

Soon after, another man enters the confessional. “Father, it has been two months since my last confession. I have had sex with Nookie Green twice a week for the last two months.”

This time the priest questions, “Who is Nookie Green?”

“A new woman in the neighborhood,” the sinner replies.

“Very well,” sighs the priest. “Go and say ten Hail “Mary’s.”

At Mass the next morning, as the priest prepares to deliver his sermon, a tall, voluptuous, drop dead gorgeous woman enters the sanctuary. The eyes of every man in the church fall upon her as she slowly sashays up the aisle and sits down right in front of the Priest!

Her dress is green and very short, with matching shiny emerald green shoes.

The priest and altar boy gasp, as the woman in the matching green shoes and dress sits with her legs slightly spread apart. The priest turns to the altar boy and whispers, “Is that Nookie Green?”

The bug-eyed altar boy can’t believe his ears but replies, “No, I think it’s just the reflection off her shoes!”","A young Catholic man goes to confession and says, “Father, it has been one month since my last confession. I have had sex with Nookie Green every week for the last month.”",8

She replied ""20 dollars is 20 dollars.""
He nodded sagely and they went home.

Next year they went back to the fair, and the year after that.  Every year his longing to ride the airplane grew, and every year her answer was the same. ""Twenty dollars is 20 dollars"".

After many years the now old man was talking to the pilot about how he had always longed to ride in his airplane, but his wife wouldn't let him waste their money.

""I have an idea"" the pilot said. ""Let's make a bet. You ride in the plane and if you don't make a sound the whole time, i'll give you your money back.""

The man's wife reluctantly agreed, and the couple climbed into the back seat. The pilot fired up his engine and took off. Determined to make his money, the pilot did a series of barrel rolls, corkscrews, loop the loops, even climbed straight up until the engine stalled then dove straight down until he could restart it. Not a peep came from his passengers, so he levelled off and landed. He turned around and was shocked to see the old man sitting alone.

""Where's your wife?"" The pilot exclaimed.

""She fell out at the second barrel roll."" The man replied

""Why didn't you say something? We could have landed and gone to look for her!""

So he continues to rob the house.  Just as he's about to get a flat screen tv off of the wall, he hears the same voice from above that again says, ""Jesus is watching you.""

This time his adrenaline shoots up as he knows for sure that the voice was not his imagination.  In panic, he shines his light back and forth across the room looking for the source of the voice; until finally, his light shines upon a big bird cage hanging from the ceiling with a parrot inside of it.

The thief breathes a sigh of relief and says, ""Oh, you're just a harmless parrot.  You had me scared for a second, haha.""

So the thief continues working on getting the flat screen tv off of the wall.  But while he's working, he asks the parrot, ""Hey parrot, what is your name?""

The parrot responds, ""My name is Moses.""

The thief pauses and with a chuckle asks, ""What kind of stupid owner would name his parrot Moses?""

The parrot replies, ""The same owner that named his rottweiler Jesus.""",Jesus is watching you.,47
