What j did was blend too long standing comedic methods into one which I had expected to produce a neat sum of their two parts. Instead there was an adverse reaction that creates a sort of exponential comedic product 

Simply combine ""that's what she said"" jokes with ""yo momma"" jokes and suddenly you have ""that's what your mom said"" as a quick response to any sort of statements possible 

What you will find is people are caught completely off guard and the usual shields in place for yo momma jokes we all acquire naturally at a young age in he public school systems somehow sont respond in time and so people get angry before they realize it, I fact this joke isn't even that funny just powerful. Whenever you would normally say ""that's what she said"" try to go ahead and replace it with ""that's what your mom said"" and let me know how it goes for you.

If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell.""

""The remains are approximately 515,550 years old. This is what we have been able to determine with our superior forensics technology.""

Before the KGB is even done giving their report, the 2-man Stasi team is already making their way towards the cave. They are carrying just a duffle bug with them. They enter the cave and make their way towards the remains. Soon after, sounds of shouting, swearing and banging start coming out of the cave and they don't let up for 2 whole days. When the Stasi forensics team finally leaves the cave, they are dirty and disheveled, their clothes ripped and their tools are damaged.

""So, the remains are 515,553 years, 7 months, 3 weeks and 5 days old.""

Amazed and dumbfounded, the archeologists and other forensics teams ask how they could possible determine the age of the remains to such an exact date.

The next patron to come in was a Libertarian, with a hunched back. He shuffled over to a booth, painfully sat down, and asked the waitress for a cup of hot tea. He also glanced across the restaurant and asked, ""Is that Jesus, over there?"" The waitress nodded, so the Libertarian asked her to give Jesus a cup of hot tea, ""My treat.""

The waitress nodded, so the Democrat directed her to give Jesus a cold beer.

""On my bill,"" he said loudly.

As Jesus got up to leave, he passed by the Republican, touched him and said, ""For your kindness, you are healed."" The Republican felt the strength come back into his legs, got up, and danced a jig out the door.

Jesus passed by the Libertarian, touched him and said, ""For your kindness, you are healed."" The Libertarian felt his back straightening up and he raised his hands, praised the Lord, and did a series of back flips out the door.

Then, Jesus walked towards the Democrat, just smiling.

As reported by the San Jose Mercury News:

During the final days at Denver's old Stapleton airport, a crowded United flight was cancelled. A single agent was rebooking a long line of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, ""I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be first class.""
The agent replied, ""I'm sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.""
The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear, ""Do you have any idea who I am?"" Without hesitating, the gate agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone.
""May I have your attention please?"" she began, her voice bellowing throughout the terminal. ""We have a passenger here at the gate WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to the gate.""
With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore, ""F**k you."" Without flinching, she smiled and said, ""I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to stand in line for that, too.""
The man retreated as the people in the terminal applauded loudly. Although the flight was cancelled and people were late, they were no longer angry at United. ",Stapleton Airport Incident,28

As you'd expect from an amateur golfer, the ball slices hard right and off the fairway, breaking a window in a nearby house. Slightly embarrassed, the man says to his wife, ""Well I feel bad. We'd better go knock on their door and offer to pay to replace the window."" So, they put their game on hold and walk over to the house.

The man knocks on the door and waits a few seconds before hearing a male voice simply say, ""Enter!"" The couple walks in to a large, well-decorated house and stop in the entryway. They still don't see anyone or hear anyone speak, so the man says loudly, ""Uhh... Hello?"" The same voice is then heard from another room within the house saying, ""Take a right, and then a left, and then another right. There, you'll find me.""

Sure enough, the husband and wife follow the man's directions and find the source of the voice. There in the middle of a large area rug within a beautiful living room sits a man. He is cross-legged on the floor wearing nothing but linen pants and a large turban. As they approach the man, the couple notices the golf ball had not only broken a picture window, but had then hit a decorative vase, which lie broken on the floor.

""My wife and I just came by so I could apologize for breaking your window and offer to pay to have it replaced,"" the man says, but is cut off. As the odd-looking man raises his hand and bows his head, he says, ""Do not fret. I am a genie, and I have been trapped inside this vase for 5,000 years. I am very grateful for having been released, so I will now grant you three wishes.""

Excitedly, the couple looked at one another and the man quickly piped up, ""I could used about 20 million bucks!"" to which the genie replied, ""It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written your new account number.""

Then, the woman says, ""I've always wanted a chateau on river in Paris!"" So the genie replied, ""It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written the address to your new home.""

Now, the two decided they should really think about their third wish. They began whispering off to the side about what they want it to be. Meanwhile, the genie asks, ""May I interject? I have been trapped inside that vase without the company of a woman for 5,000 years. I've already granted you $20 million and a beautiful home in Paris. Would you possibly be open to allowing me 30 minutes in the bedroom with your lovely wife?"" 

The couple talks about it briefly, and eventually the man says, ""Well I'm getting a ton of money out of the deal, and my wife is getting her dream home, so we've decided that would be okay.""

So, the genie and the woman go into the other room and come out 30 minutes later. As the genie finds his place on the floor once again, the couple promptly returns to discussing their third wish. After another short period, the genie chimes in once again, saying, ""Excuse me, if I may interrupt just one more time. How old are you sir?"" The man, slightly confused, replies, ""That's a weird question for a time like this, but I'm 29."" Then the genie turns to the man's wife and asks, ""And you ma'am, how old are you?"" Visibly puzzled, she says, ""That's hardly an appropriate question to ask a lady, but I'm 27."" 

To this, the genie takes a moment to stand up from his seated position and says, ""Aren't you two a little old to believe in genies??""",A young married couple are out golfing together...,205

post,4ni377,2qh72,jokes,false,1465587966,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4ni377/fattest_pig_contest/,self.jokes,,"One day 3 farmers are coming back from town when they see a sign for the County Fair coming next month, right below the main advert is another for a Fattest Pig Contest. The farmers have pigs on their farm so they think they should enter. 

When they get back to the farm the first farmer goes ""Let's get the fattest pig we have"" the second says ""And lets feed him a lot every day till the competition"" the third one goes ""And let's plug him up back there with a cork to keep him from getting any skinnier"".

So the farmers get a cork, plug their fattest pig up back there and begin feeding him copious amounts of food every day for a month. When it's time for the competition, they load him up into the back of their truck (after much struggle) and drive to the fair grounds. As you might think, their pig is the biggest there by a mile and they win the contest.

When they get back to the farm they realize they're kind of stuck with this really gigantic pig with a cork plugging it up and it looks like it's about to burst. They ask themselves who's going to be the one to unplug it. They all look at one another and say at the same ""Not me"". So they come up with the brilliant idea of buying a monkey and teaching it to unplug corks.

So they return to the fair ground and buy a monkey with some of their winnings from the contest. They start training it to uncork, on command, smaller things like wine bottles first, moving on to larger things like barrels. After a while they feel confident enough in their monkey's ability and take him and the pig outside to a large field.

They set the monkey next to the pig and first farmer says ""You know what, I'm going to stand 10 feet back for this."" The second says ""Well I'm going to play it safer and stand 50 feet back."" The third one goes ""And I'm going to play it even safer and stand 100 feet back.""

The moment of truth comes and they give the command to the monkey to unplug the cork from the pig.

The farmer standing 100 feet back closes his eyes as the command is given. He hears a roaring sound like a waterfall and when he opens his eyes he sees he's standing up to his ankles in pig shit. He runs to the farmer who stood 50 feet back and he's up to his waist in pig shit. After digging him out they run to the farmer who stood only 10 feet back, and he's in pig shit up to his neck but he's laughing hysterically.

He keeps on laughing as they're digging him out they ask ""How could you be laughing so hard?"" ""Yeah, you're in pig shit up to your neck!"" to which he replies ""Yes, but you should've seen the look on the face of the monkey as he tried to put the cork back *in*!""",Fattest Pig Contest,7

Seeing nothing but a large casket, and rather confused, he continues on his way home.
Though he is sure there is nothing causing the racket, he is convinced he is still hearing the noise. The man cleans his ears and continues on his way, but still hears the thumping.
Concerned, the man looks behind him and the sound subsides again. The man begins to search the dumpsters and look over the fences in the area. He calls out to see if anyone responds, only to notice the funerary box a few feet behind him.
Visibly perturbed, the man begins to pick up his pace, but the thumping matches the tempo of his feet upon the ground.
The man pulls out his phone and opens the camera to look behind him while he walks, to discover that the pine box is ""hopping"" along with him, only a few steps behind. The man turns around and the thumping stops and the pall is stationary. The man opens the lid, but sees nothing.
Frightened now, believing the crate to be a death omen, the man stumbles backwards and breaks into a run towards his house. The thumping becomes more rapid, and the man screams for help. Rounding the last corner and fumbling with his keys, the man makes it through the door of his house; locking it behind him and pulling out his phone to dial the authorities.
The sarcophagus breaks through the door as the man shakily dials the last number. In a panic, the man drops his phone and runs up the stairs, locking himself in the bathroom. The man hears a momentary pause in the thumping while he rifles through the cabinets, searching for anything to defend himself. The thumping grows ever closer, as the man realises there is nothing but a substantial metal tin of cough drops to defend him.
