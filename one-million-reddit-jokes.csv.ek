While waiting for the coffee machine to finish brewing, the Colonel decided to pose a question to all assembled.

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep.

He posed the question of just how much of sex was “work” and how much of it was “pleasure?”

A Major chimed in with 75%-25% in favor of work.

A Captain said it was 50%-50%.

A Lieutenant responded with 25%-75% in favor of pleasure, depending upon his state of inebriation at the time.

There being no consensus, the colonel turned to the Private First Class who was in charge of making the coffee and asked for his opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young Private First Class responded, “Sir, it has to be 100% pleasure.

The colonel was surprised and as you might guess, asked why?

""Well, sir, if there was any work involved, the officers would have me doing it for them.”

Edit: thanks for the silver kind stranger!",A U.S. Marine Colonel was about to start the morning briefing to his staff.,1947

After the man finished his drink, he asked the bartender, ""If I show you an even better trick, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the evening?"" The bartender agrees, thinking that no trick could possibly be better than the first.

The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny rat. He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues. The man reaches into another pocket and pulls out a small bullfrog, who begins to sing along with the rat's music.

While the man is enjoying his beverages, a stranger confronts him and offers him $100 000 for the bullfrog. ""Sorry,"" the man replies, ""he's not for sale."" The stranger increases the offer to $250 000 cash up front. ""No,"" he insists, ""he's not for sale."" The stranger again increases the offer, this time to $500 000 cash.

The man finally agrees, and turns the frog over to the stranger in exchange for the money. ""Are you insane?"" the bartender demanded. ""That frog could have been worth millions to you, and you let him go for a mere $500 000!"" ""Don't worry about it."" the man answered. ""The frog was really nothing special.

post,bq9ouj,2qh72,jokes,false,1558218309,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bq9ouj/a_man_wakes_up_in_a_slum_with_no_memory_of_how_he/,self.jokes,,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,50

But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy

But it's better than drinkin' alone

Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

""What's that?"" he thinks. He reads: synagogue. ""I'll go there NOW""

The rabbi and all the administrators are extremely meticulous and precise; he checks everything, all the accounts and invoices and everything is flawlessly registered. There's really nothing to fine there.

He starts going out, quite disappointed, when he notices a small box.

""What's in that box?"" he asks

""ah, you see sir, in our rites we use candles. We tend to spare, and at the end of the rite we collect the melted wax, and we put it in that small box. At the end of the year we send it to the candle factory, they melt everything together and they send us back four candles for free, which we use again for our rites.""

The auditor wants to check. Well, the rabbi has EVERYTHING registered: the number of candles, the weight of the wax, ... there's really nothing to fine.

He starts walking through the door, even more disappointed, but there's another small box:

""what's in that box?"" he asks

""ah, you see sir, in our rites we use wine. And at the end of the rites we collect all the corks, and we put them in that small box. At the end of the year we send it to the corks factory, and they send us back four corks for free, which we use again for our wine bottles.""

The auditor think ""this time I got you"". But again, the rabbi has really EVERYTHING registered: the number of bottles, the number of corks, the weight of the corks, ... there's really really nothing to justify a fine.

He is morally destroyed, feeling like a failure. He is already on the street, and then a thought flashes in his mind:

""But Rabbi!"" he asks ""do you still do circumcisions here?""

""Yes"". Gotcha:

""And what to you do with the leftover skin?""

The rabbi points to a wooden box:

""Yeah, we put them all together in that box, which once a year we ship to the auditing company, and they send us a dickhead""",The auditor goes to the synagogue,181

Somehow I caught the balcony below, but within seconds someone came out to their balcony and started beating on my fingers! I fall from the balcony and land in the bushes. I was alive! As I’m processing what just happened, I look up and see a fridge come over the balcony and crushes me. 

St Peter: Wow, that’s something. What about you?

Man 2: I was suspicious of my wife cheating, so I came home early from work today and found my wife naked in bed. Now either housewives lay around all day naked with candles burning and Barry White playing, or something was up. I searched the apartment but couldn’t find anything. That’s when I heard a noise on the balcony. I go outside and see someone hanging off the edge, so I start beating his hands until he falls... BUT HE DIDNT DIE!

A man, wearing sunglasses and driving a sport car stops by:

She's intimidated by the sport car and the confident demeanour of this man, but she accepts, and they start getting to know each other.

""it's very nice that you pick me up in such a car. it's a long way home from here""

""it's a pleasure babe"".

""what do you do?"" she asks

""I'm a DJ and speaker at the radio"" he answers.

She's delighted: ""oh really? It's so cool. I always listen to the radio. Do you also have those show with song requests for birthdays?""

""yes, I do those kind of shows, we receive song requests for birthdays. Have you ever tried?""

Embarrassing silence follows. Somethings is in her head, and she gains courage to say it:

""well you see... I always wanted to call and request a song, but I heard it's always hard to get a place, there's a lot of people requesting... and I sort of don't know how this kind of things work, maybe I have to speak live and then don't know what to say. But I always wanted to do it... today is also my little sister's birthday...""

""well, babe, we could change this, don't you think? She'd be very happy, and you too"" wink wink

He starts to sort of take a long route, apparently driving where no one can see, his intentions are clear.

""where are we going?""

""you see, babe, you could do something for me, and maybe I could get you a fast lane to do what you want for your sister's birthday...""

She starts getting it, but she is not sure, the situation is so intimidating, but also exciting, and she sort of want to do it - for her dear sister.

He parks the car in the middle of nowhere, stops the engine, and starts unzipping his jeans. She is scared, doesn't know what to do, it's all so new.

""what worries you, babe?""

""Well you see I've never done this sort of things, I'm embarrassed, I'm just a girl from the countryside, I... I don't really know if...""

He knows his way in reassuring a scared woman: ""don't worry babe, you'll be fine, there's nothing you can do wrong, just be yourself. Think of your sister. you'll make her day""

He proceeds to take his genitals out. She freaks out internally, but thinks to herself ""whatever, I'll do it for her"". She looks into his eyes, he looks into her eyes, reassuring and firm. She starts to get her mouth close to his penis. She opens her mouth:

They just died but they need St. Peter’s permission to get in Heaven.

 He asks to one of the men how he died and the men replied “I am living in a tall building and I decided to come home early because I suspected my wife was cheating on me. As soon as I enter the room my wife was naked and panting, I proceeded to get my bat, that is signed by the Yankees, and look for the guy. Then I see someone hanging in the window and I tried to hit him, but as I tried to hit him he covered his head therefore falling to his death... but he LIVED! Luckily he fell into some bags and waved his hands towards me and said “F*** YOU!” I got mad and threw my refrigerator to him but my clothes got stuck in one of the fridge’s edges and I died with the other guy”

St. Peter was astonished and he decided that the man should go to Hell. Then, the next man appears and he seemed a humble guy. St. Peter than asked him how he died and the man responded “I was cleaning windows on a tall building and the plataform ropes’ broke. As I was falling to my death, I did a quick prayer and just threw my hands to the building. Randomly I could hang on one of the windows, I was really happy but then I saw a guy with a bat signed by the Yankees trying to hit me. I tried to cover my head but I didn’t think about the consequences of it. The Lord was so merciful that I landed on bags and I decided to forgive my aggressor and obviously I waved my hands towards him to say “I’m OK”, but that mad man threw a refrigerator at me and I died”

St. Peter was again astonished... “Man you should really go to Heaven on how salty you are” St. Peter said. The 3rd man walks in front of St. Peter and St. Peter made the same question he told the last two guys and the man responded “St. Peter, I honestly don’t know, I just remember being naked inside a refrigerator...”",Three men walked in St. Peter’s office...,5

Dad thought about this for a very long time, and replied, ""Son, the idea of society is far too complicated for your young mind. Let me give you a better analogy: I am the head of the household, so let's call me the Government. Your mother works as a lawyer, so let us call her the Law. Your nanny is paid to do work, so let's call her the Working Class. Your baby brother is still an infant, so let us call him the Future. Now, go to bed.""

&amp;#x200B;

When Billy went to bed, he pondered about this for a very long time but could not understand it so he fell asleep. Later that night, his baby brother started crying so he woke up and took a look. It appeared that his brother shit himself and not wanting to deal with that situation, he gave him his pacifier and left. Billy then went to his mother's room and saw that she was fast asleep, snoring like a million pigs. She then went to the nanny's room and found that the door was locked. He peeked through the keyhole and saw that his dad was fucking the nanny. Shaken by this sight, Billy decided to just go back to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, Billy walked up to Dad and said, ""Dad! I figured out what society is!""

""Oh, and what is that, Billy?"" asked Dad.

""The Law is fast asleep while the Government screws the Working class, and the Future is in deep shit!""",Oh Billy!,3

“No why would I-oh”

“One more question for you. Got any grapes?”

And the man just stopped. Then, he started to smile, he started to laugh, and he laughed for awhile and then said,

“Come on duck, let’s walk to the store. I’ll buy you some grapes so you won’t have to ask anymore,”

So they walked to the store and the man bought some grapes. He gave one to the duck and the duck said,

""We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's Tiber River called Teste.""

""Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the city! The rooms are small, the service is surly, and they're overpriced. So, whatcha' doing when you get there?""

The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!""

""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand, I knelt down, and he spoke a few words to me.""

So the woman is kinda hungry, and asks the man to get her a steak. So the man does. The woman also wants something to wash it down, of course, so she asks for a soda. The man comes back with a soda, and the woman, picky as ever, is saying she never wanted a soda in the first pla- you know what? I lost my spot. Let's start over. So, there once was a man and woman at a party. The party had lines for everything, buffet style, a fruit line, a water line, a steak line. So the woman is kinda hungry, and asks the man to get her a steak. So the man does. The woman also wants something to wash it down, of course, so she asks for a soda. The man comes back with a soda, and the woman, picky as ever, is saying she never wanted a soda in the first place. She wants a milk. The man, despite a long line, comes back with a milk. The girl says the milk is too small, so the guy goes back and gets another milk. The woman says that he took too long and that her other milk is warm now. Which makes absolutely no sense, because the milk couldn't get above room temperature without being microwaved or otherwise warmed, which the woman must have done. Man, the man should really find someone else. Well anyway, where were we? Oh yeah. The woman says she is grossed out and doesn't want a milk anymore, so she asks for punch. The man walks around, all around the building, but cannot get what the girl wants. Why?

""What seems to be the trouble today, Mr. Wainscotting?"", the doctor asks.
""Doc, I've got terrible pain starting in my bicep and extending down to my forearm."" replies Mr. Wainscotting.
""Let's have a look.""
The doctor examines him and can't find anything outwardly wrong so he orders xrays. 
After the xrays are completed, the doc looks at them and comes up with a diagnosis.
""Mr. Wainscotting, you appear to have tendonitis, commonly referred to as 'tennis elbow'."", he reports.
""Really?  I could have treated this at home and saved the money."", said the patient, clearly annoyed.
""Have you heard about the new medical diagnostic machine they have at CVS?  It's remarkable.  For 1 dollar, it can scan affected body parts or analyze samples and give you an accurate diagnosis."", offered the doctor.
""That sounds unlikely.  But thanks for the info and visit.""
Mr. Wainscotting pays his bill and leaves the office.  He goes to a CVS to get some Tylenol and notices a machine he's never seen before.  
He thinks, 'Could this be the machine the doctor was talking about?'
He looks it over and sees places to put various body parts that have what look kind of like blood pressure cuffs.  There's also a receptacle to place samples for the machine to analyze.  He's intrigued.  He decides to give it a try.  He puts a dollar in and places his affected arm in one of the cuffs.  The machine beeps and boops and spits out a card that reads   'YOU HAVE TENDONITIS, COMMONLY KNOWN AS TENNIS ELBOW'
Mr. Wainscotting isn't impressed.  Surely the doctor is playing an elaborate prank on him.  He goes home and decides to put the machine to a real test.  He goes to the hamper, gets a pair of his wife's panties and takes them to the back yard.  He finds a few dog turds and picks them up with the underwear.  He brings the shit-filled panties into the bathroom and jerks off on them.  Sealing the unholy contents in a Ziploc, he heads back to the drug store.  The machine is there, ready for his sample.  He puts the bag of poo and spermy panties in the sample opening and deposits a dollar.  The machine beeps and boops and spits out another card that reads:
YOUR DOG HAS WORMS.  YOUR WIFE IS FUCKING THE MAILMAN.  AND IF YOU DON'T STOP JACKING OFF, YOU'LL NEVER GET RID OF THAT TENNIS ELBOW.

Joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.  He doesn't have much luck, until one  
day, he comes across a Harley with a 'for sale' sign on it.  

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.   
   
It's shiny and in mint condition. He buys it and asks the seller how he   
kept it in such great condition for 10 years.    
   
'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is  
outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.    
   
It protects it from the rain, and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.   
   
That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents.  
Naturally, they take the bike there.  Just before they enter the house,  
Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to tell you something about my family.   
When we eat dinner, we don't talk.  In fact, the FIRST person who says  
anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'   
   
'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.    
   
Joe is shocked. Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  
In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the  
corridor, everywhere he looks.  Dirty dishes.   
   
They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.   
   
As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  
He leans over and kisses Sandra.  No one says a word.   
He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table  
and makes love her, right there in front of her parents.   
   
His girlfriend is a little flustered, her Dad is obviously livid and her mom  
horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.    
   
He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.  
Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and  
makes love to her like s she never had before every which way right there on the dinner table.    
   
She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.   
   
His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to  
ear.  But still....Total silence. 

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. c  
   
Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.  
Suddenly the father shouted.  I'll do the fuckin dishes!! ","The Harley, Vaseline, and The Dishes",61

The convention was held annually, and is the most famous convention for pornstars in the country. The conductor was formerly a pornstar himself, and has made many friends throughout his career. He was involved in a small porn label, and has since been donating money to them to keep them thriving. As a special treat to the label, he offered to take the label’s pornstars on one of his trains to this years pornstar convention. 

The conductor asked his boss if it was okay to do, and his boss agreed. The conductor has been loyal to his railway company for years, and deserved to do something like this. The conductor recently purchased a private train, built with fine leather couches and a build in bar. The only problem was the wheels could possibly slip off the track, but he thought it would be fine since it’s a short trip to the convention. 

He gathered the pornstars and invited them into the train. They marveled at how luxurious and glamorous the train car was. The conductor happily walked to the front of the train, and began the journey to the convention.

Around halfway through the trip, the conductor saw a sharp turn stemming from the straight tracks ahead. He prayed that the wheels wouldn’t slip and take the turn instead of going straight. As the train approached closer and closer to the sharp turn, the conductor started praying. “Please don’t turn, please don’t turn,” he mumbled worriedly. All of the sudden, the train jerked sharply and the conductor flew out the window, and landed into a group of people. He yelled for the train to stop as it continued without him, but he set the train on autopilot, so it wouldn’t be coming back. The conductor stood there solemnly, watching his own train leave without him. The people around him asked if he was okay. A large police officer approached the conductor and asked what had happened.

“We were.. I was-“ the conductor stammered, “I was taking my friends to a convention, and the train took the wrong turn and- and we went- and we went to - we were going to the convention-“ The police officer looked confused. “What is going on here?  You are saying so many things!”

The mayor as furious as the commander decides to arm the admin and hire another 80. He thought this plan was flawless he even fenced the ocean by the ship, it was fail-proof. But the fisherman never left he was hiding under the dock just fishing away, but to piss them off and to make it look like he left he clipped the fence. So he did it, day in and out, even more, guards and even more guns, but to no avail, it didn't work.

Welcome to Heaven,"" says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there's a problem: We seldom see a Conservative here and we're not sure what to do with you."" 
""No problem, just let me in; I'm a believer."" says May. 
""I'd like to just let you in, but I have orders from the Man Himself: He says you have to spend one day in Hell and one day in Heaven. Then you must choose where you'll live for eternity."" 
""But, I've already made up my mind; I want to be in Heaven."" 
""I'm sorry, but we have our rules."" 
And with that, St. Peter escorts her to an elevator and she goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell. The doors open and she finds himself in the middle of a lush country house garden. Standing in front of it her dad...and thousands of other Conservatives who had helped her out over the years....... 

The whole of the ""Right"" was there. Everyone laughing...happy...casually but expensively dressed. 
They run to greet her, hug her, and reminisce about the good times they had getting rich at expense of the ""suckers and plebs"". They play a friendly game of croquet and then dine on lobster and caviar. 
The Devil himself comes up to May with a frosty drink, ""Have a Marguerita and relax, Theresa!"" 
""Uh, I can't drink any more, I’m watching my weight"" says May, dejectedly. 
""This is Hell, Theresa: you can drink and eat all you want and not worry, and it just gets better from there!"" 
May takes the drink and finds herself liking the Devil, who she thinks is a really very friendly guy who tells funny jokes and pulls hilarious nasty pranks. kind of like an Oxford undergrad.
They are having such a great time that, before she realizes it, it's time to go. Everyone gives her a big hug and waves as May steps on the elevator and heads upward. 
When the elevator door reopens, she is in Heaven again and St. Peter is waiting for her. ""Now it's time to visit Heaven,"" the old man says, opening the gate. 
So for 24 hours May is made to chill with a bunch of honest, 
good-natured people who enjoy each other's company, talk about things other than money, and treat each other decently. Not a nasty prank or mean joke among them; no fancy country seats and, while the food tastes great, it's not caviar or lobster. And these people are all poor, she doesn't see anybody she knows, and she isn't even treated like someone special! 
Worst of all, to May, Jesus turns out to be some kind of Jewish hippie with his endless 'peace' and 'do unto others' stuff. 
""Whoa,"" she says uncomfortably to herself, ""Margaret never prepared me for this!"" 
The day done, St. Peter returns and says, ""Well, then, you've spent a day in Hell and a day in Heaven. Now choose where you want to live for eternity."" 
With the 'Jeopardy' theme playing softly in the background, May 
reflects for a minute, then answers: ""Well, I would never have thought I'd say this - I mean, Heaven has been delightful and all - but I really think I belong in Hell with my friends."" 
So Saint Peter escorts her to the elevator and she goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell. 
The doors of the elevator open and she is in the middle of a barren scorched earth covered with garbage and toxic industrial waste...kind of like Middlesborough. 

She is horrified to see all of her friends, dressed in rags and chained together, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. They are groaning and moaning in pain, faces and hands black with grime. 
The Devil comes over to May and puts an arm around her shoulder. 
""I don't understand,"" stammers a shocked May, ""Yesterday I was here and there was a country house and we ate lobster and 
caviar....drank cocktails. We lounged around and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and everybody looks miserable!""

The string says, “I sure am!”.

The second piece of string walks out of the bar and sees the first piece of string still wondering where to go next.  As they are commiserating with each other about how ridiculous the bartender is being a third piece of string walks up and is about to enter the bar.  The first piece of string says, “Hey buddy, don’t bother, the bartender is kind of a jerk and he doesn’t serve string in his bar.”

The third piece of string agrees that is not the nicest policy so he says to the other two pieces of string, “I am going to get served by him.  Watch this!”  The third piece of string then starts writhing around and twists and contorts in on himself until he is all bunched up in the middle.  He then reaches up and tousles his head until it is just a mess and walks into the bar.  The bartender watches him with a look of disdain as he crosses from the door to the bar stool and hops up.

Not happy with no longer on top he determined to get back above the others. So, he climbed and climbed, pushing other flakes out of his way until finally he emerged and found himself once again on top.

Unfortunately, his joy was short lived as just then a bunch of raisins came tumbling into the mixer covering him up.

Not one to give up he once again began his journey upward, this time pushing aside and down the raisins that were dumped on top of him. After much effort and time, he found himself once again on top.

Just then however the mixer turned on tossing all the corn flakes and raisins around. Naturally the corn flake found himself covered with both other corn flakes and raisins. Determined to rise to the top he started his climb another time. Pushing aside corn flakes and raisins one by one, he found himself eventually on top once again.

No sooner had he reached the top than the mixer started to pour the mixed flakes and raisins into bags. Obviously being at the top he was among the first in and found himself at the bottom of the bag. With a determination he didn't know he had the climb began again. After overcoming all the other flakes and raisins to reach the top of the bag he found himself once again on top.

He was just in time to see the bag get sealed. Once sealed the bag was placed in a box with the top side down so the box bottom could be sealed. Feeling the weight of his kin again the flake began to climb. With a drive that never seems to ebb he pushed aside his fellow flakes and found himself with none above him, once again on top.

At that moment the boxes were all wrapped together to prepare for shipping, and you guessed it, they found themselves flipped again. Figuring this had to stop at some point the flake began his trek again. Overcoming all obstacles, flake and raisin alike, the ambitious corn flake was victorious again, once again on top.

As the case of boxes was loaded on to the truck, to the surprise of no one, it was once again found with the previously up side down. With no reason to give up after all that he had already accomplished, his upward climb resumed. Passing what was now becoming old friends he heaved himself upward until he found himself once again on top.

At the grocery store the case of boxes was unloaded and placed in the store room to await shelving. With no regard for the contents the box was placed upside down again. With nary a thought for giving up, the corn flake continued his calling to reach the top. Moving above his colleagues he succeeded and found himself once again on top.

Naturally it was just then that the shelves needed restocking. Making sure to be upright on the shelves the corn flake once on the bottom… again. ""No reason to give up now"" he thought"", and began his journey again until he found himself once again on top.

Of course, it would be at that time that a customer grabbed his box and dropped it carelessly into their cart. Do you even need to ask the orientation? No. Not one to quit, the flake once again worked to conquer the climb to the top until he was once again on top.

After being purchased the bagger diligently made sure the box was right side up in the bag. Unfortunately, this meant that the corn flake was on the bottom one more time. Beginning again the flake began to…

""Yep,"" replies the duck. 
""And you can talk!"" exclaims the barman.  
""Yep again”, says the duck, ""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?"" 
""Certainly, sorry about that”, says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint. ""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing round this way?"" 
""I'm working on the building site across the road,""explains the duck. ""I'm a plasterer."" 

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it. 
So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves. The same thing happens for two weeks.
Then one day the circus comes to town. The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him, ""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""  
""Sounds marvellous,"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. ""Get him to give me a call.""
So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says, ""Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money."" 
""I'm always looking for the next job,"" Says the duck. ""Where is it?"" 
“At the circus,"" Says the barman.
""The circus?""  Repeats the duck. 
""That's right,"" replies the barman. 
""The circus?"" The duck asks again, “with the big tent?"" 
""Yeah,"" the barman replies. 
""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.  
""Of course,"" the barman replies. 
""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck. 
""That's right!"" says the barman. 
The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says .......

“First, may I ask how many sheep are they?”

“Hmm, of which kind, dear? White sheep or black sheep?”

“Oh. The white ones, for example.

“Right now there are around 200 white sheep on this meadow.”

“Wow, that’s impressive. And how many black sheep are there, then?”

“About 200 too.”

“Oh lord, that’s a lot too!”

“There is always room for improvement. Was there anything else you wanted to ask?”

“Actually, there is. What do they eat?”

“Which ones are you asking it for, darling? White ones or black ones?”

“I don’t know… the white ones.”

“Oh, so the white sheep only eat the best hay in the farm and greenest grass while grazing.”

“Huh, interesting. And what about the black ones?”

“Well, the black sheep eat the best hay and the greenest grass too.”

“Umm okay. There was another thing I was wondering.”

“Shoot.”

“How much wool do these sheep produce?”

Phil is married, no children.

Steve is a single father. 

Jack hasn't really grown up yet and loves to play pranks.

One day at the office, they are talking about an upcoming ""boys night"" they have planned, when Kevin, the new supply manager, overhears. Now Kevin recently just moved across the world, all the way from South Korea, and his English is not the best. 

He asks the guys, in broken words, if he can join in. He has yet to make many friends, and the move has caused him and his wife a wealth of stress. 

""Sure, Kevin, a night out would be good for you! Meet us at Chili's tonight at 9:00,"" Phil told him. 
Kevin excitedly hurried off, with a pep and his step and a smile on his face. 

At closing time the guys grab a cab to Chili's and start ordering drinks. After a few minutes they realize they've forgotten about their new friend Kevin-he hasn't arrived. They decide it won't be rude to go ahead and order some starters. A couple hours pass like seconds, and it's suddenly time to leave. 

""Bummer about Kevin,"" Steve said. ""I guess we should've given him directions.""

""Yeah, we should've grabbed his phone number too. We'll apologize Monday at work, and invite him out again.""

The weekend passes without incident. The trio arrive at work to find printers without ink, boxes with office supplies piling high, and bathrooms without soap or TP. They see their boss, fuming as usual. He shouted, ""Where in God's name is the supply manager we hired? They don't teach punctuality and work ethic in his homeland??""

Phil was a little perturbed; Kevin was always at work before everyone at the office and made sure everything was in order. 

""Something's...off,"" he muttered under his breath. He was snapped back to reality when his phone rang in his pocket. A number he didn't recognize flashed across the screen. He picked up, anticipating a sales call, but instead was assaulted with racial slurs interrupted by violent sobbing, through a heavily accented female voice. 

""Where's Kevin? What you do with my husband??"" The woman shrieked through the receiver. Phil held the phone several inches from his ear, calmly telling this woman he last saw Kevin Friday night before dinner. 
Her husband had apparently told her about the dinner, but had never come home, after 24 hours had passed, she filed a police report. So far, they had no leads. 

Phil promised the poor woman he would let her know should anything come up. The guys were sullen, and the headed to Jack's office. Upon his door was a bright yellow post-it note, with a phone number written in plain print. 

""Another female conquest,"" he said as he jabbed Steve's ribs with his elbow.

He casually called the number, but nobody answered. He tossed the note aside and the three went to work. The Monday was as long as Monday's usually are. The guys were still in the office at 8:00 that night finishing their, long after everyone had left. 

""We should stick around and see if we can find anything that might be able to help the police find Kevin,"" Phil said. He'd been thinking about him all day. His friends agreed. They went back to Jack's office. Steve spied the post it note from earlier in the day. He picked it up and called it, suddenly curious about these 10 digits. 

Vrrrttt. 

The noise was muffled and quiet, but unmistakably the sound of a phone vibrating on a hard surface. The voicemail box had not been set up yet, so no telling who it belonged to. 

""Let's follow it. It could have something to do with Kevin,"" Steve said. 

Phil and Jack both nodded, determined to rescue their new ethnic friend. So the three wandered the floors of the building, calling the number, and eventually noticed the vibrating sound was louder in the lobby. 
 
Vrrrrrrtttttt. Vrrrrrrtttttt.

It came from a door behind the security desk, one they had never noticed. 

Vrrrrrrtttttt

Jack audibly gulped and pushed open the door. 

VRRTTTTTTTT

Louder the noise grew. A dark tunnel was the only thing behind that door. 

VRRRRRRTTTTT

They cautiously followed the tunnel, onward it went, forever, like a tale that has long overstayed it's welcome. 
Steve spammed the dial button on his phone.

VRRRRRRTTTTTT TT VRRRRTTTTTTT

The noise become unbearably loud as they neared a blank door at the end of the tunnel. A dim light shone from the floor, where a phone sat vibrating against the cold concrete. Phil picked it up, and they were suddenly thrust into complete silence, the only noise the sound of their shallow, nervous breathing. Without words, the agreed to open the door before them. 

Jack slowly reached for the handle, then stopped wiping sweat from his brow. He returned his hand to the doorknob, but before he could turn it, it swung open, slamming against the wall with a loud BANG. 

Confetti, florescent lights and fog exploded from the room, and Kevin jumped from the middle of it all and yelled, ""SUPPLIES!!""

The first couple to test it is very excited, they connect the machine to the soon-to-be-mother and warn the husbands about the consequences. ""Men are not used to feel pain like this, even a small amount of it could knock you out. We will start with 10%""

&amp;#x200B;

The man agrees, sits besides his wife and the first contractions begin. The woman screems in agony while the machine starts its work and the scientist sets it to 10%. ""Do you feel a difference?"", they ask the woman, and she nods. ""It got slightly less painfull!""

&amp;#x200B;

The man clenches his fists and his teeth to prepare for the pain but seems to handle it quite well. ""Are you alright?"" ""Yes, i'm fine. Increase the pain transfer, i want to support my wife as good as possible!"" So they increase it to 25%. The next wave of pain arrives and the mother screams again, but not as hard as the first time. The husband, still clenching his fists, instructs the scientists to increase the percantage even more. ""I can take it, please make that my wife feels less pain!"" The scientists agree and increase it to 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman almost seems relaxed during the next few contractions, only making light sounds of discomfort, while the man is highly concentrated, breathing steadily. ""I'm a very tough man, increase it to 100% please!"" he asks the scientists. ""But sir, such high amounts of pain can kill you!"" ""I'm absolutly sure, i can handle it. Please, i want to make this completly painless for my wife""

&amp;#x200B;

They increase the machine to 100%, the wife now completly relaxed while her body does all the work without a trace of pain, while the man's head turns red, his knuckles turn white. ""See i can handle it"", he says stoicly.

&amp;#x200B;

4 hours later the baby is born, a healthy baby girl. The wife is very happy with the procedure having felt no pain for most of the time, the husband proclaims he's probably the toughest man in the world and that he felt not that much pain, being a real man and so on. The machine is celebrated as great invention of making the fathers part of the birth. Husband and Wife take their newborn baby back to their house.

“I think it’s only safe to infer that due to the vastness of space, it is almost impossible to state that there is a lifeless existence just beyond this planet. From our view of the millions of stars and galaxies, I firmly believe there are people looking out into the void and speaking about us as well.”

So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, ""Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""no problem. Come on down.""

""No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse.""

""Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.""

So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like ""LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says ""holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?"" And horse says ""Bass. Learn to play bass.""

So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, miss, come on down.""

""Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow.""

""Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.""

So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says ""Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.""

Horse says ""Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.""

So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, man. Come on down.""

""Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken.""

""Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.""

So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like ""what the fuck? that sounds amazing."" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says ""Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE.""

So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say ""Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.""

Horse says ""Thanks, guys. you're the best,"" and he takes off.

Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself ""Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.""

So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says ""Hey. Why the long face?""

So a man and 2 of his friends go on a road trip when suddenly their car breaks down. They notice that there's a farm nearby, so they ask if they can crash at his place, which he allows. 

However, he says that if he catches any of them sleeping with his daughter, he'll kill them.

Next day he finds out that all of them slept with his daugher. He proposes an idea that could potentially save their lives. He told them to pick two of their favorite fruit and shove it up their butt. They cannot a peep or else they're dead.

The first guy gets some oranges gets the first one up but the second one makes him moan. Dead.

The second guy brings cherries. First one in easy. The second cherry is halfway up when the man laughs. Dead.

The second guy meets the first guy in heaven and the first guy asks him why he laughed.

There were once three blue men driving in a blue car on a rainy blue night. It was so bad that they could barely see the blue road ahead of them. Suddenly, their car broke down, but luckily, there was a big blue sign for a hotel just down the road. The three blue men quickly left their blue car and made the short hike to the hotel, which was — you guessed it — blue.

A blue receptionist was waiting at a blue desk and welcomed the visitors. “Greetings, gentlemen! Are you looking for a room?”

“Yes please, three.”

The receptionist handed them three blue keys and they went to their respective rooms. The first man went into room 3. It had blue walls, a blue carpet, a blue bed, a blue bathroom with blue towels, and a blue TV. The second man went into room 4. This one also had blue furnishings. The last man went into room 7. Like the others, it was decorated all in blue. The three blue men watched some TV and eventually went to sleep, where they had pleasant blue dreams.

The next morning, they awoke to a beautiful day. The sun was shining blue, the sky was a clear blue, and the bluebirds were singing. They greeted each other and decided to head to breakfast. They sat down at a blue table with blue chairs, and a blue waiter promptly came over to hand them their blue menus.

“Good morning! What can I get you to eat?”

After a moment, the first man said, “I feel like having some cereal. Do you have any frosted flakes?”

“Yes sir,” the waiter replied, flashing his pearly blue teeth. “And how about you?”

The second man thought for a while, then said, “I guess I’ll have cereal too. You got cheerios, right?”

“Absolutely! And last but not least?”

The third man shrugged and said, “You know, I feel like having frosted flakes as well.”

“Great! I’ll be right back with your orders!”

After a couple minutes, the waiter brought them three blue bowls of cereal with blue milk and blue spoons. The three blue men ate their breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The moral of this story is that two out of three people prefer the taste of Frosted Flakes® over other brand name cereals.",The Blue Joke,0

Later that night, the man decides to take the doctor's advice, mounts his wife and starts pounding away. After a few moments, he becomes exhausted and falls asleep.

The next morning, the man wakes up and sees the other side of the bed is empty. Listening more intently, he makes out the sound of pots and pans clanging in the kitchen. He gets up, walks over to the kitchen, and sees his wife doing dishes and humming with joy. As he watches her, he suddenly slaps his forehead and says:

Around 3 a.m., a bit loaded, I headed for home.

Quickly, realizing my husband would probably be awake, I cuckoo'ed another nine times, so that he would think it was 12 cuckoos -- or just midnight.

I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution in order to escape a possible conflict with them. 

The next morning, my husband asked me what time I got in and I told him, ""Midnight!""

He didn't seem pissed in the least. 

I had gotten away with it, I thought.

Then he said, ""We need a new cuckoo clock.""
