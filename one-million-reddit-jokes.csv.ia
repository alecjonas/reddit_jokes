So he asks the bartender ""Where is the beautiful music coming from?""

The bartender reaches under the bar and pulls out a shoe box with a tiny little man playing on a tiny little piano.

""Whoa where did he come from?"" asks the man.

Leaning in the bartender says softly, ""One of those old whiskey bottles behind me has a genie living inside, and he will grant anyone that orders a glass one wish.""

Excitedly, the man orders a drink, and when the bartender opens the bottle out pops a genie.

""What is your wish?"" the genie asks.

Thinking for just a second the man says, ""I wish for a million bucks!""

The genie snaps his fingers and disappears. The man and bartender wait for a few seconds, not sure how to tell if the wish was granted. 

Slowly at first but growing louder they hear a lot of commotion outside. So they rush outside to find a million ducks quacking and looking confused.

Angry, the man turns to the bartender and shouts, ""I WISHED FOR A MILLION BUCKS NOT DUCKS!""

The bartender shrugs and says, ""Yea, as if I wished for a 10-inch pianist.""

The couple found themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.  
While waiting they began to wonder; Could they possibly get married in Heaven?  
When St. Peter arrived they asked him if they could get married in Heaven.  
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he left.  
The couple sat and waited for an answer.... for a couple of months.  
While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all?  
What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?'  
Another month passed. St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.  
“Yes,' he informed the couple, 'You can get married in Heaven.'  
'Great!' said the couple. 'But we were just wondering; what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'  
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard on the ground.  
'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.  
'OH, COME ON!!!' St. Peter shouted. 'It took me 3 months to find a priest up here! Do you have ANY idea how long it'll take to find a lawyer?”

With each trip up the ladder, the young lady caught the eye of another male customer and soon every male customer was asking for raisin bread.

Of course, naturally he was accepted to prestigious Universities by the time he was eligible. He studied economics and then directly pursued law. He topped the bar exam and started his own firm, Chic &amp; Ken, with an older successful rooster. It became the most prestigious firm in the entire farm. At this time as well, because the law allows it, he wed many lovely hens and fathered many healthy eggs. One dawn, he went out a little earlier than his usual time to crow. The moon was very round and seeing himself being the only animal awake, he started to contemplate about his life. He asked himself why was he so blessed in life and why did it feel like he never had a setback. How good life was if he could live forever. Unknown to him, his wish would be granted but it would be the start of a tragedy. The next day, his firm was the centerpiece of the biggest scandal in history and he found out that his partner was working closely with terrorists. Within two days, Chic &amp; Ken was no more and he had to move his entire family to another smaller coop. He had to look other jobs to support such a big family and he went to the stable, and the garden, but no one would dare hire him. At nightfall he went back to his home but to his horror, his wives and their brood were massacred by foxes; he had just caught a glimpse of their tails when they were fleeing the scene. Hopeless, he tried to kill himself many times but to no avail and after a year, he decides to leave the farm. One day, he came up to a busy highway when suddenly a fairy appeared and said to him that he was cursed to live forever but today it has finally been lifted.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over $100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

And so, he went to the governor's house, grabbed a hose and started watering the plants, after a few minutes the governor finds and asks him what he's doing and so the young man says: ""oh mister governor I've been your fan for a long time, I voted for you in every election and have been supporting you for years now, but for these past few months I haven't had any sustainable income so I was just looking for odd jobs and noticed your plants are wilting away, I was thinking I would water them for you without a hitch but since you're here I wanted to ask if you could spare me a bottle of soda since I haven't had a sip of it for months now"".
The governor, feeling bad for the young man said: "" go in the house to my daughter and tell her to give you a bottle, and my Gardner has had an injury so if you want you can replace him until he comes back, I'll pay you with food or water for everyday you work here."" And so, yadiks goes up to the daughter's room and tells her: ""your father said you need to give me your virginity"", suspicious, she learns out the window and says: "" daddy, should I really give it to this guy ? You don't even know him."" But the governor assured her that it's fine and he can have it since he works here now, and so the two make love for half an hour and the young man leaves. And this chain of events keeps happening on a daily basis until, after a month has passed, the governor heard a small squeak that resembled his daughter's voice. thinking about it, he pieces everything together and realised that the new gardener he hired was actually having sex with his daughter. Instantly he called his bodyguards and went to his daughter's room where he found the couple happily in bed. In a fit of rage, he said: guards, grab yadiks and beat the shit out of 'em"".

These kingdoms were very different one from another.
The first kingdom was the richest - smooth stone walls built like a fortress, lavish houses for all, and a generous king who made the lives of his townsfolk quite enjoyable. They had want for nothing, for they had many riches.
The second kingdom wasn't as fine - its outer walls of cobblestone and wood held the middle-class villagers, who had to slap on some elbow grease once in a while to get things done.
But the third kingdom was the most desolate of all - rotting walls of wood housed the peasants, farmers and slaves. Ridden with disease and dirt, one's dream house would be anywhere but here.

One day, the king of the first kingdom decides he wants the lake, for it is a valuable resource, and so he wages war on the other two kingdoms over the lake; winner takes all.
For such a war, the first kingdom sends out a hundred war-trained knights clad in the finest steel armor you've ever seen with polished swords and armored stallions of battle. To accompany them, a squire is assigned to each knight to tend to his every need, no matter how demanding.
The second kingdom, since they're not as wealthy as the first, sends out fifty knights with top-notch leather armor and a few horses, as well as two dozen squires for the lot.
The third kingdom sends out its only warrior with the suit of armor his father passed down to him when he died of smallpox. Seeing as said warrior is quite elderly, they task their king's only squire to him to aid him in his endeavours.

The night before the battle, the first kingdom's knights have a huge party. They get drunk off their asses with wine and mead, and everyone has one hell of a night.
The second kingdom's knights don't have such luxuries, so they sit around a large fire with pints of ale and recount battle-won victories of the past, with the squires offering music and dancing for entertainment.
The third kingdom's lone knight decides he's not in the mood to party since he's way past 50, and has a small beer before nodding off under a tree. The squire makes him beef stew in a pot, and hoists it up in the tree with a noose around a thick branch to consume it for breakfast before their battle.

The sun rises, roosters crow, and the knights awaken. The first kingdom's knights all have head-splitting migraines from their hangovers; the second kingdom's knights aren't doing that well either; the third kingdom's knight slept in. They collectively decide that no one's in the mood to wield a sword and kill anyone, so the three kingdoms send their squires out to battle. And what a battle! Blood was spilled, skulls were shattered, enemies were slain, and against all odds, the lone survivor of this massacre was the lone squire from the third kingdom. As was agreed by the three kings, the third kingdom was given the lake.

I suppose it goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is equal to the squires of its two opposing sides.","In Medieval Europe, there once was a triangular lake.",375

 I was the only speaker to show up, so I had the stage to myself. I talked about staying in school, getting good grades and all that usual bullshit; and since I had plenty of time because those other guys didn't show, I threw it open for questions.

 The last one asked was, ""Can you give us a couple of your life's philosophical beliefs?""

 I said, ""That's an easy one.  Looking back over my lifetime, I've spent most of my money on guns, airplanes, fast cars, women and whiskey.  The rest I just wasted.""

 I was escorted out without getting to finish my last two rules to live by:

1) If it flies, floats, or fucks, it's cheaper to rent it.  

2) If it's got tits or tires, you're gonna have problems with it.

I hope they invite me back next year so I can finish.  They need to know this shit!

The man yells out 65. Dead silence, no one laughed. He figured maybe that was a bad joke, so he tries again. 82 the man yelled out. Again no one laughed. Again he thinks that must be a lame joke, so he tries one of the jokes he heard everyone laugh at earlier. So the man yells out 132. But still no on laughs.

Just as he finally kissed her on the forehead, she said - ""Goodnight Mom, goodnight Dad, goodbye forever Grandpappy""

The father was a little disturbed by the last part but shook it off and went to bed.

The next day, the father was in complete shock to hear of his father-in-law's passing. He thought about what his daughter said but dismissed it as a brutal coincidence.

That same night he tucked his daughter to bed and she said - ""Goodnight Mom, goodnight Dad, goodbye forever Grandmommy"" 

Again the father felt disturbed by that last part but thought that lightning wouldn't strike in the same place twice.

The next morning he gets a call saying that his mother had passed away in her sleep. 

The father [understandably] was speechless.

On the third night, as he tucked his daughter to bed she said - ""Goodnight Mom, goodbye forever Dad""

The father shat himself and wouldn't take any chances. The next morning he gathered supplies and he rushed to his office. He promised to lock himself in his office until midnight to avoid death. 

After the anxious, arduous day, the clock finally strikes 12am and he's safe! He's not dead!

When the father gets home he finds his wife waiting for him by the kitchen table.

""James, where have you been all day?""

""Just uh... the office... had to catch up on some work. How was your day?""

""Horrible. Just as we were about to seal a big business investment, my boss collapsed and died right in the middle of the board meeting""","Goodnight Mom, goodnight dad.",10

So Little Johnny went and put on his coat and walked to church.

He turned to the yellow pages, and began his search for the perfect musicians. After days of searching, he finally found a guitarist, a turtle. As strange as it seemed to the horse, he decided to arrange a meeting. The turtle was anything but average. He slayed on the guitar, the horse couldn’t believe his eyes or his ears.
The horse told him of his dream, and the turtle agreed to join the band. He gave the horse two phone numbers, one for a rabbit that played the keyboard and one for an armadillo who played the drums. The horse had finally put together his dream band, and they quickly gained recognition for their work. 
They sold out concerts left and right! Life was good for the band, and the horse wanted nothing more. Until one day the rabbit fell ill, and after countless months in the hospital, he died. This broke the horse’s heart, and the band began falling apart in front of him. 
The turtle became a drug addict and was no longer useful or cooperative.
The armadillo, stressed from all the fame and expectations the world forced onto him and his band, had enough, spat in the face of the horse, and left him in the dirt. The horse felt worse than he had ever before. He was broken. He had no one to turn to. He hoped a cold beer or two, or six, might numb his pain a little, for he had lost it all. His dream, flushed down the sink because of his carelessness.

After showing the woman many different kinds of birds, she noticed a beautiful big green parrot on the corner.

\-	""I am sorry but that parrot is not for sale"" – said the pet store worker.

\-	""Why not?"" – asked the woman.

\-	""He used to live in a brothel and he has learned many 'bad words' and I would not recommend it as a house pet"" – answered the worker.

The woman talked to worker until he finally agreed to sell her the parrot. Claiming that she had no trouble with his “vocabulary” and that it would be funny when he got any visits.

At home, she got everything ready for her new pet. As soon as the parrot got into the cage, he said:

\-	“New house, new pimp”.

The woman laughed about it, knowing the origins of the parrot.

On that day her daughter came by to visit her. The parrot saw her and said:

\-	“New house, new pimp, new whore”.

Shocked about that, the daughter asked the mother about the parrot. She explained her daughter that the parrot came from a brothel. They both shared a laugh and kept talking about the parrot.

Later, the husband came home. The daughter and the wife were excited to see what the parrot was going to say. As soon as the parrot saw the husband, he said:

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.
When the first volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the sausage company president rushed to the fire chief and said, 'All of our secret sausage recipes are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They have to be saved, so I will donate $50,000 to the fire company that brings them out and delivers them to me.'

But the roaring flames held the firefighters off. Soon more fire departments had to be called in because the situation became desperate.

As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer to extricate the secret recipes was now $100,000 to the fire department that could save them.

Suddenly from up the road, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the fire engine of the nearby Baringa volunteer fire department composed mainly of Aboriginal firefighters over the age of 65.

To everyone's amazement, the little run-down fire engine, operated by these Aboriginal firefighters, passed the fire engines parked outside the plant, and drove straight into the middle of the inferno.

Outside, the other firemen watched in amazement as the Aboriginal old timers jumped off and began to fight the fire as if they were fighting to save their own lives..Within a short time, the Baringa old timers had extinguished the fire and saved the secret recipes.

The grateful sausage company president joyfully announced that for such a superhuman accomplishment he was raising the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave elderly Aboriginal firefighters.

A TV news crew rushed in after capturing the event on film. The 'on camera' reporter asked the Aboriginal fire chief, 'What are you going to do with all that money?''

Well,' said Chief Billy Cokebottle, the 70-year-old fire chief, 'de first ting we gonnna do is fix dem brakes on dat farkin old truck, eh!!'

Their names are Eric, David, Stacy, and Mohammad. Eric is an outgoing guy who will often spend his weekends stunt driving. David just got out of basic training, Stacy is a professional swimmer, and Mohammad makes coffins for a living, and in his free time. They walk in to the main entrance of the abandon hospital, and they are a bit tipsy, and decide they want to play with a ouija board. They all put their hands on the board. Stacy doesn’t want to do it, out Eric convinces her to play. They all talk amongst themselves and decide to ask if their are any spirits amongst them. Their hands move across the board. They land on “Yes”. Before any of them can say anything, a cloaked man appears behind Eric. “I am death.” Says the cloaked figure. “For your punishment for trying to summon a spirit from the afterworld, I must take you all.” Before Death kills them, Eric yells “IM SORRY BRO” “I’m not your bro” “Just give us some time!” Stacy bursts out. “Usually I don’t do this, but since I have a tinder date tonight, I’ll give you 2 to 70 days to live. You will all die on different days. Eric will die in a car. David will die from something small and metallic. Stacy will loose her breath, and Mohammad will suffocate.” Says death. He disappears.

2 days later:
All of the friends are paranoid, not knowing when they will die. Stacy calls everyone to make sure they are okay. While she is on the phone with Eric, he suggests they all meet up at her house. They all agree.

Stacy waits outside for them. Mohammad pulls up and exits his car. 
David pull up in his car.
Eric comes riding a bike, because he is to frightened to drive. 
Everyone approaches the front of Stacie’s house.
“Did everyone do everything we discussed?” Asked Stacy 
“I got rid of all of my guns in case I shoot myself” David says while twirling his car keys.
“I will never drive again” Eric whines.
“I’ll try to stay in open areas” Mohammad says. 
“And I’ll never go swimming again” Stacy says. 
“Hold up I gotta get something from my car.” Says David. 
As he is walking over to his car, he trips on a rock and falls. As he falls, he pierces his stomach with his car keys. 
“SOMETHING SMALL AND METALLIC!” Shouts Eric. 
“I- I have i first aid kid in my trunk.” David says in a weak voice.
“I’LL GET IT!” Says Eric. 
Eric runs over to his car and opens the trunk. He crawls into the trunk.He sees the first aid kit and reaches for it. As he is reaching for it, the trunk closes behind him and cuts off both of his legs. “HOLY SHIT!!” Stacy and Mohammad scream simultaneously. A fly flies into Stacie’s mouth and she starts choking. Mohammad ran to his car, screaming. He drives away. Leaving the rest of his friends to die. 
Mohammad gets to his house where he makes coffins. He runs in, locks the door and lays in front of the door. Coffins lay all around him. 
Suddenly, one of the coffins starts moving. Frightened by this, Mohammad screams and runs into his living room. The coffin grows feet and starts to walk over to him. He realizes there is only one solution. He looks through the cabinets in the kitchen. He finds a bottle of medicine labeled “NyQuil” As the coffin approaches him, he holds up the bottle. He knows it will stop the coffin. 

Because only NyQuil stops the coffin.

Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that 
a new bellringer was needed. The bishop decided that he 
would conduct the interviews personally and went up into 
the belfry to begin the screening process. After 
observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, 
he decided to call it a day when a lone, armless man 
approached him and announced that he was there to apply
for the bellringer's job. The bishop was incredulous.
""You have no arms!""
""No matter,"" said the man, ""Observe!""
He then began striking the bells with his face, producing 
a beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened 
in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a 
suitable replacement for Quasimodo. Suddenly, rushing 
forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and 
plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death 
in the street below.  The stunned bishop rushed to his side.
When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around 
the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had 
heard only moments before.  As they silently parted to 
let the bishop through, one of them asked,
""Bishop, do you know who this man is?""
""I'm not sure"", the Bishop replied, ""but his face sure rings a bell.""

In fact, it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there.

&amp;#x200B;

The boss asked him, ""Have you ever been a salesman before?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes sir, I was a salesman in India"", replied the lad.

&amp;#x200B;

The boss liked the cut of him and said, ""You can start tomorrow, and I'll come and see you.""

&amp;#x200B;

The day was long and arduous for the young man, but he got through it.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally 6:00 P.M. came around.

&amp;#x200B;

The boss duly fronted up and asked, ""How many sales did you make today?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, just ONE sale."" said the young salesman.

&amp;#x200B;

""Only one sale?"" blurted the boss, ""No! No! You see here, most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. If you want to keep this job, you'd better be doing better than just one sale!""

&amp;#x200B;

""By the way, how much was the sale worth?""

&amp;#x200B;

""It is 93,300,534.00 pounds"" said the young man.

&amp;#x200B;

""What? How did you manage that?"" asked the flabbergasted boss.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well"", said the salesman, ""This man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod and some fishing gear. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast""

&amp;#x200B;

""So I told him he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty-foot schooner with the twin engines.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Then he said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new Deluxe 4X4 Blazer.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I then asked him where he'll be staying, and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him one of those new igloo 6-sleeper camper tents.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then the guy said, ""While we're at it, I should throw in about £100 worth of groceries and two cases of beer.""

&amp;#x200B;

The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?!""

""No"" answered the salesman,

Five hours later they staggered out of the theme
park. Her head was reeling and her stomach felt
upside down. He then took her to a McDonald's
where he ordered her a Happy Meal with extra
fries and a chocolate shake.
Then it was off to a movie, popcorn, a soda pop,
and her favorite candy. M&amp;M’s. What a fabulous
adventure! Finally, she wobbled home with her
husband and collapsed into bed exhausted.
He leaned over his wife with a big smile and
lovingly asked. 'Well Dear. what was it like being
eight again?
Her eyes slowly opened and her expression
suddenly changed.
'I meant my dress size. you idiot!!!'
The moral of the story: Even when a man is
listening. he is going to get it wrong.

Boris used to be a famous race horse. He'd won countless trophies, and was famous across the world.

Then, suddenly, at the peak of his career, Boris was involved in a horrible accident. Between races his private jet was hijacked and crashed, and only Boris survived. However, Boris was devastated. His friends, his family, and his colleagues had all been lost on one fell swoop.

""I'll never race again!"" he vowed.

So Boris quit his job, and found an old farmer who agreed to take him in. Old Farmer John was his name, and he loved Boris like a son.

However, the incident in Boris' past had led him to a life of recluse. He was fearful that everything would go wrong again, and so he spent every day in the barn.

And Old Farmer John took pity on Boris, and so he decided something.

Every week, Old Farmer John would go onto the town to sell his produce. And every week, he would set aside a small amount of money for Boris.

And every week, he would buy Boris a present, in the hope that one day, he'd be reminded of the wonderful life outside the barn, and he'd be happy again.

One thing he bought Boris was a CD player.

Another was a brand new computer..

But the best thing he ever gave to Boris was this:

Ten gallons of beer.

Let me explain.

On his many trips to town, Old Farmer John would pass a pub. It was called The Fine Race Horse, and among those who drank there, it was famed for having the best beer... In the world.

But it was only a small pub, and as such it wasn't visited by very many people, and it one day went out of business.

And when Old Farmer John heard this, he immediately got up and went into town, and spoke to the old owner. And John agreed to buy all his remaining beer.

And so, John came back from town one day, and gave Boris the beer. He'd never seen Boris so happy. It made his heart rejoice.

And for months, Boris would talk about this beer, and how it was the best gift he'd ever been given.

But one day, Old Farmer John came home with a brand new guitar. And Boris remembered the CD player he'd been given, and he remembered his favourite songs.

And Boris picked up the guitar, and he began to play a song.

And he was __good__.

And after hearing his song, John went over to Boris and said

""that was the best thing I've ever heard. You should go out into town and see the record company about starting a band!""

At first, Boris was hesitant. But eventually, he decided that Old Farmer John was right. He'd been his barn for so long. But now it was time for him to rise to fame again!

So he packed a few things, and grabbed his guitar and got on the next bus into town.

And on the way, he met a pig.

The pig's name was David, and David could play the drums.

And just like Boris, David the pig was on his way into town trying to make his name as a musician.

So Boris said

""hey, why don't we team up and make a band, after all, we're both animals with a talent. We could be the next big thing!""

And David agreed, and the two of them continued on into town.

At the next stop, a Hen got onto the bus. And her name was Sophie, and Sophie liked to sing.

She knew all the words to all the songs in the world.

And so, Boris the Horse and David the Pig went over to Sophie the Hen and said

""hey, why don't we team up and make a band, after all, we're all animals with a talent. We could be the next big thing!""

And Sophie agreed, and the three of them went to the record store, and started their band.

And they were an instant hit. They became a worldwide phenomenon almost overnight. They scored TV deals and sponsorships, and once again Boris had reached the life of fame.

They toured with all sorts of other famous bands, appearing alongside the likes of The Rolling Stones and Electric Light Orchestra.

And then, one day, they got the biggest deal of their lives.

They got invited to go on a world tour. They would play their music in every country on earth. By the time they were done, the whole world would know their name.

And so, of they went, from one country to the next, playing their music every step of the way.

They played in every city and in every town. And the Horse, the Hen and the Pig became a household name.

And when they got back home, they knew, they had reached the peak of their careers.

And they kept touring, playing in many countries across the globe.

But one day, everything changed.

One day, before they were set to fly out for their next performance, Boris received a phone call from the hospital in his home town.

And he found out that Old Farmer John had passed away.

So he decided to head back home so could Bury the man he treated like a father. So he said to Sophie and David

""you go on ahead, I'll be with you in a day or two.""

So the pig and the hen went of in their private jet, and Boris the Horse went home to Bury Old Farmer John.

But when he got home, he was in for a shock.

He received a call from his agent, and discovered that the private jet that David and Sophie were on had exploded in a freak accident, and there were no survivors.

And Boris was struck with grief.

For the second time in his life, he had lost everyone he loved.

And he became depressed, and stumbled into his old barn, and decided to take his own life.

But then he saw something that stopped him. 

Because in the old barn, was the huge tank that once contained the 10 gallons of beer.

And so, Boris decided that instead of suicide, he would have a few drinks, and would go on and turn his life around.

So Boris goes into town, and sees the pub, The Fine Race Horse, and underneath the sign on the door, he sees another sign, saying ""grand re-opening.""

And Boris knows that this is where he will have his beers, and forget all his sorrows, and turn his life around.

And so Boris the Horse enters the bar. And the bartender takes a look at him, and he asks

""why the long face?"" ",A horse named Boris.,2983

They can find no place to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, ""It was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."" The Project manager is sitting there thinking, ""I didn't know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't missed him when she slapped me!"" The young woman was sitting and thinking, ""I'm glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"" The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, ""Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!""",Cunning,58

Early one morning he heard a knock at his door and when he answered he was greeted by a salesman in a suit stood next to a tall white horse.

""Good morning"" said the salesman ""I'm selling this horse, would you be interested?""

The priest had not ridden a horse for many years and asked ""Why would I need a horse?""

""Oh, this isn't just any horse."" replied the salesman ""This is a holy horse. You see, this horse has been blessed by god with unmatched speed and is well trained. Simply say 'Bless you' and the horse will start moving faster the more times you say it, but in order to stop you say 'Amen'.""

​The priest used to enjoy riding so he decided to at least try it out on a nearby field, he and the salesman walked over and the priest mounted the horse and said ""Bless you"" and sure enough the horse began to walk forwards, again the priest said ""Bless you"" and the horse began to trot, once more the priest said ""Bless you"" and the horse began to canter. Finally the priest said ""Bless you, Bless you, Bless you"" and the horse shot off around the field faster than the priest had ever seen a horse gallop before. The priest shouted ""Amen"" and the horse screeched to a halt next to the salesman.

The priest felt exhilarated and bought the horse immediately, after all, it's not every day you get offered a holy horse.

The next day the priest goes for a ride on the horse begins by saying ""Bless you"" and took the horse back to the field. The priest wanted to know just how fast his new horse could go. He starts off fast, ""Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you"" he says and the horse ran faster with every shout, ecstatic he shouts again  ""Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you"" and again with each shout the horse ran faster this time running so fast it could barely turn in the wide, open field and before the priest know it the horse leaped over the fence right before running into it, the priest pressed on and shouted once more ""Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you, Bless you"" and the horse ran so fast it was skipping over fields in a couple of seconds each, the priest had never felt so alive riding so quickly.

However, the priest had just noticed something coming up on the horizon, a steep cliff face that plunged straight into the ocean. He had to stop and soon. However, in all the excitement he had forgotten the word to stop the horse. He racked his brain for an answer and in his panic tried everything he could think of, ""umm... woah! er... God bless! oh... In Jesus name?! Please stop, horse!"" but the horse kept running straight towards the cliff. The priest knew he wouldn't remember in time resigned himself to this fate, deciding to say the lord's prayer one last time before it was over, his fastest recitation ever:

""OURFATHERWHOARTINHEAVENHALLOWEDBETHYNAMETHYKINGDOMCOMETHYWILLBEDONEONEARTHASITISINHEAVENGIVEUSTHISDAYOURDAILYBREADANDFORGIVEUSOURTRESSPASSESASWEFORGIVETHOSEWHOTRESSPASSAGAINSTUSLEADUSNOTINTOTEMPTATIONBUTDELIVERUSFROMEVILFORTHINEISTHEKINGDOMTHEPOWERANDTHEGLORYFOREVERANDEVER

...

AMEN!""

And with that the horse came screeching to halt no less than one step away from certain doom, the priest couldn't believe it, ""OH... Thank you god!"" he cried, breathless, ""Thank you so much and you horse... oh... Bless you""",A priest buys a holy horse.,18

Since her birthday was not far off he asked what she'd like to have for her birthday.
""I'd like to be eight again"", she replied, still looking in the mirror. 
On the morning of her Birthday, he arose early, made her a nice big bowl of Coco Puffs, and then took her to Adventure World theme park. What a day! He put her on every ride in the park: the Death Slide, the Wall of Fear, the Screaming Roller Coaster, everything there was.
Five hours later they staggered out of the theme park. Her head was reeling and her stomach felt upside down. He then took her to a McDonald's where he ordered her a Happy Meal with extra fries and a chocolate shake.
Then it was off to a movie, popcorn, a soda pop, and her favorite candy, M&amp;M's. What a fabulous adventure! 
Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed onto the bed, exhausted. 
He leaned over his wife with a big smile and lovingly asked, ""Well Dear, what was it like being eight again?""
Her eyes slowly opened and her expression suddenly changed. 
""I meant my dress size, you &amp;@*#% retard!!!!""

Even when a man is listening, he is gonna get it wrong.

""I came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed. She claimed she had just gotten out of the shower.

Well, her hair was dry and I checked the shower and it was completely dry too.I knew she was into some hanky-panky

and I began to look for her lover. I went onto the balcony of our 9th-floor apartment and found the guy clinging to the rail

by his fingertips. I was so angry that I began bashing his fingers with a flower pot. He let go and fell, but his fall was broken by some awnings and bushes. On seeing he was still alive I found super human strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over. It hit the man and killed him.  At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a massive heart attack and died.""

Saint Peter thanked him and sent him on to the waiting room.

The second applicant said that his last day was his worst...""I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment and I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th-floor apartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot. I fell but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up,  I saw a huge chest falling toward me. I tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest.""

Saint Peter couldn't help but chuckle as he directs the man to the waiting room.

Saint Peter is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters.

He apologizes and says ""I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the two fellows that arrived here just before you.”

I don't know"" replies the man. ""Picture this, I'm naked, hiding in this cedar chest….",Saint Peter is seeing all of the new arrivals trying to go through the pearly gates in Heaven.,254
