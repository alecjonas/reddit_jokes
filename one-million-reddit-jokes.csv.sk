A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen

four hour, surgical procedure.
A young student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath.
'Nurse', he mumbles, from behind the mask 'Are my testicles black?'
Embarrassed, the young nurse replies 'I don't know, Sir. I'm only 
here to wash your upper body and feet.'
He struggles to ask again, 'Nurse, are my testicles black?'
Concerned that he may elevate his vitals from worry about his 
testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and sheepishly pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his p*nis in one hand and his testicles in the other, lifting and moving them around.
Then, she takes a close look and says, 'There's nothing wrong with 
them, Sir !!'
The man pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her and says very 
slowly, 'Thank you very much. That was wonderful, but listen very, 
very closely......

In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In it were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash.

She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner.
After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, “I’m so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”

Bill thought for a while and said, “I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”

Hillary was shocked, but said, “Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I’m disappointed and saddened by your behavior; however, since you are addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”

Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, “So why do you have all that money in the box?”

He answered, “Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center.”",Bill and Hillary,1589

post,4vpk0c,2qh72,jokes,false,1470095342,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4vpk0c/monks/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

""Son, your fifth birthday is coming soon. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?""
The son ponders this for a few seconds, then he says to his dad,
""I want a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.""
The father is confused. He asks his son what that is, but his son just smirks bemusedly and replies,
""You will know it when you see it.""
The father searches for it. He looks for it in every store around, but cannot find it, so instead he gets his son a teddy bear, and his son is happy. It still bothers him a little that he couldn't find the gift, but it was of no consequence.

Years pass. Now the boy's 10th birthday is a month away. His father goes up to him and says,
""Son, your tenth birthday is coming soon. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?""
The son thinks for a bit, then he says, 
""Well, ever since I was little, all I ever wanted was a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.""
The father is confused, as his son hadn't asked for that since his fifth birthday. He asks his son what that is, but his son just smiles and says, 
""You will know it when you see it.""
The father combs the internet, looking for hints as to what this thing may be. He looks through the stores as well, but to no avail. So instead, he gets his son an Xbox, and his son is happy. But that seed of doubt that was planted years ago kept growing, even if the father didn't acknowledge it. 

Nonetheless, years pass. It is a month till the boy turns sixteen, and the father goes up to him, and says, 
""Son, your sixteenth birthday is coming soon. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?""
The son thinks for a bit, then says to his father, 
""I remember I first asked for it when I was five, but I never got it... I've always wanted to have a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.""
The father is frustrated. 
""Son, I've looked for that thing every year you ask for it, and I can never find it. Can you tell me what it looks like, please?""
The son shakes his head. 
""It's not that difficult, dad. You'll recognize it when you see it.""
The father goes on internet forums, asking antique toy dealers and the like if they've ever heard of this toy that his son is describing. Nobody knows what it is. Eventually the father runs out of patience and buys his son a luxury sports car instead. It's a very nice car, and his son is very happy, but now the father is doubting himself... what kind of man is he if he can't get his son exactly what he wants with all that money to throw around? He pushes the thoughts aside, and life continues.

A few months pass, and one night, while the son is out with his friends, the man receives a phone call from an unknown number. The woman on the line is a stranger.
""Is this the residence of Mr. Smith?""
""Yes, this is Mr. Smith. What is it?""
""It appears that your son... Bob Smith... was involved in a car accident about an hour ago. He's on life support. I'd advise you to visit him while he still has breath in him. We're doing all we can. I'm very sorry, sir.""
The man wastes no time in getting to the hospital. He is by his son's bedside within mere minutes. He looks at his son, who is in great pain, as shrapnel has been embedded all over his body from the accident. The man, knowing that his son may not live to see the next sunrise, leans on the bedside and says to his son,
""Son, I know I am about to lose you, I know that you will die, but let me do what I can to make your final moments the best possible. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. Is there anything you would like?""
The son's voice is weak and choppy. 
""Well... dad... ever since... I was... a boy... I've always... wanted to... be in possession... of a... pink-and-purple...poofy-rated...ping pong... ball... can you... get me...one...?""
The man is furious. 
""Son, you've been asking for that for years, and not one time could I find it! Please, just tell me what it is!""
The son sighs, feeling his body weaken with every passing second.
""Okay...I'll tell you...what it...looks like...it's kind of...like a...""
The boy's eyes close as the void swallows him, his words trailing off into nothingness. The heart monitor stops. The boy is dead. ",Pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball,1

The man searches for a name in his mind and finally lands on one.

St Peter turns around and pulls out a phone, dialling for God. The phone rings a couple times before a deep voice asks what's up.

St Peter replies, ""Quick question sir, did the Titanic sink? Or did it burn?""

One of those people you meet at a bar and invite to move in just because someone else had moved out on short notice. Because it's always a good idea to make major decisions like that while thoroughly hammered. 

Anyway, this guy moves in soon enough we discover him nodding out on the living room couch with a needle stuck in his arm. The rest of us were like, _that man's on drugs!_ 

Then his eyes popped wide open and he said, 'who has drugs?' 

He was a popular guy though. People would ring the bell. Stop by and say hi. Go up to his room, hang for a bit. Then move on out. To do their thing. Whatever that thing might be. 

Which seemed pretty nice, until one day we realized there was a line going all they way around the block straight to our front door. 

They all just wanted to say hi?

But then we found out the worst of the worst. It turned out he had a fetish for kitten porn. At first we were like, what - girls who dress up as cats? Meow! 

No. He liked to masturbate to videos of kittens being squished under the stilettos heels of well dressed asian women. 

This freaked the entire household the fuck out. I mean, who likes creepy shit like that? So one day we rented another place, packed up everything, and waited until he was all skeezed up with a needle in his arm and nodding out on the couch.

Then quietly sneaked all our shit out and moved away, leaving him with an empty house. When we all arrived in our new pad, we gave each other high fives. Hah, we got rid of that weird dude!

And then we realized... wait. The lease on that house is in our names. We are sooooo fucked! 

We rushed back and he'd already changed the locks.

Mohammed wanted to assimilate himself into American culture right away, and decided to start a housing development in his newly adopted city.  He immersed himself in learning the culture, capitalism, and marketing and soon came up with the concept that the best way to promote his new development would be a contest, where he gave away a house.  Americans love contests, and they love winning things, so he surmised that not only would he give away one house, he’d give away two!
Being the newly savvy marketing person he was, Mohammed contacted all the local news media that began a frenzy of news activity eliciting contest entries from far and wide.  The entry forms stacked up in his office until the day of the contest deadline arrived.  He of course masterfully invited the news media to attend the drawing, and had huge fanfare as he placed all the entries in a huge drum and began to draw the names.  Photographers’ cameras flashed, TV crews filmed, and newspaper writers took notes as the first name was drawn.  
Out came the first name:  Rhonda Mauwten, a local mother of three.  Applause from the crowd erupted as anticipation for the final name to be drawn grew.  With great fanfare, Mohammed drew the second name and announced that Shelby Colm, a local business woman, was the final winner.  
The contest was a huge success and the media coverage Mohammed received far out-valued the cost of the homes he gave away.  News headlines the next day announced the ecstatic winners:  Shelby Colm and Rhonda Mouwten win sheikh homes.

After being persuaded, he drove to the reservation, handed his ticket to the medicine man, and wondered what he was in for.
The medicine man slowly, methodically produced a potion, handed it to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, 'This is powerful medicine. It must be respected. You take only teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do that, you will become manlier than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want."" The old man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?"" ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until next full moon.""
The old man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!""
Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

Sindhi said OK Doc, let's do it without anaesthesia.

The dentist removed the tooth without anesthesia. During the entire procedure, the Sindhi sat quietly, even smiling a little.

What should George R.R. Martin have called the Night's Watch? The Snow Patrol.

Hopefully you think my jokes are sansa-tional.

When I watched (major plot point), I thought ""Arya kidding me?""

I think Ned's second son would do great in business. He's a genius at Bran-ding.

These puns must be driving you stark raving mad.

If there's any negative comments about my puns, I hope I can stay above the frey.

I used to work in construction for a short bit, I could never remember what to do, so I kept asking my boss ""where do I put this?"" He just said ""Wall, durr.""

One of my colleagues was an Indian guy with a really long name, so we all called him Ram. He didn't understand English very well, so my boss always had to slowly explain what he had to do. His job mostly involved putting a specific type and size of fastener on. He kept saying, ""Ram C-Bolt on.""

After construction, I went to work at a hardware store. We had ran out of a specific type of gardening equipment, and my boss asked me to get it from its door in the supply closet. So I went to the hoe door.

Hopefully you liked these. I'll be here all week (unlike the characters on GoT).","An assortment of GoT puns (don't worry, no spoilers)",3

Sally was up first. ""I sold Girl Scout cookies and I made $30. My sales approach was to appeal to people's sense of civic duty and I credit that for my success.""

""Very good, Sally,"" said the teacher. ""Next?""

Jenny went next. ""I sold magazines and I made $45,"" she said. ""My approach was to convince people that the magazines would keep them up to date on current events and trends.""

""Very good, Jenny,"" the teacher said. Eventually it was Little Johnny's turn and as he walked up to the front carrying a large cardboard box, the teacher held her breath.

He dumped the box out onto the teacher's desk, covering it with cash. ""I made $2,167,"" Little Johnny said.

""$2,167?!"" the teacher exclaimed. ""What in the world were you selling?""

""Toothbrushes,"" said Little Johnny.

""Toothbrushes?!"" echoed the teacher. ""How on earth did you sell enough toothbrushes to make that much money?""

""I found the busiest corner in town, and set up a chips &amp; dip stand and gave everyone who came by a free sample. They all said the same thing: 'This tastes like dog crap!' 'It *is* dog crap,' I told them. 'Want to buy a toothbrush?'""

Taken aback the officer asks her to open the trunk and step out of the vehicle. Again the woman refuses and tells the officer that she can't open the trunk because inside is the dead body of the vehicle's rightful owner, who she killed earlier that day.  
Completely flabbergasted, the officer tears open her door, pulls her out of the car, cuffs her, and hauls her to the back seat of his cruiser. He then calls dispatch and asks for backup and a forensic team to join him at the scene.  
Once the forensic team arrives they open the trunk of the woman's car and find nothing. No body, no blood. They search the car top to bottom and find the vehicle registration in the car's glove box and the woman's license in her purse, both matching her identity. A second officer who is now on the scene retrieves the woman from the cruiser, sits her on the curb, and begins to question her.

Put human skin on a xylophone then run your dick on it, you'll feel the same experience.

Anyway, I told her I wasn't really feeling it, and they were sad about it, then I felt bad about it. I just told her to use their mouth and it'll be fine.

Later, they told me:
""Don't worry /u/osamasbigbro! If I'm anything like my mom, I'll start to grow boobs once I hit 12 years old!""

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, 'we're not coming out until you leave!'

The old man frowned, 'I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.'

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

He boarded the bus and found a seat next to a group of boys, whom he heard talking fast and excitingly.  Jimmy couldn't make out much of what they were saying, but he did hear the phrase ""purple wombat"" repeated multiple times. 

""But what is the purple wombat?"" Jimmy asked.

One of the boys turned to him, ""You don't know what the purple wombat is?""

Jimmy was about to answer ""no"" but it was time to leave the bus and go to his first class.  In this class he again heard some kids talking about the purple wombat and again asked them what it meant.

""Jimmy, would you please come up here for a second."" the teacher said.

Jimmy went up.  ""Don't you know not to talk in class?"" the teacher asked.

""Yes,"" said Jimmy, ""but I was just asking about the purple wombat.""

With that the teacher scolded him and sent him to the principal's office.  In there the principal asked him what was the cause of him being sent there.

""I just asked about the purple wombat!"" Jimmy exclaimed.

""That's it young man, you're going home right now!"" yelled the principal.

At home his mother was furious and demanded to know the reasons for Jimmy being sent home.

""All I did was ask about the purple wombat."" Jimmy sobbed.

""Go to your room right now!"" ordered his mother.

Jimmy went to his room and stayed there for the rest of the day.  At around midnight he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window.  It was a voice.  Jimmy opened his window to hear it better.

""Jiiimmmmmmmyyyy, I am the purple wombat, come to the island on the lake tomorow night."" said the strange yet soothing voice.

Jimmy was so excited, he would finally know what all the fuss was about.  The next night, Jimmy got his canoe out of the shed and brought it down to the lake next to his house.  He rowed out on the water and headed toward the small island. When he was close enough, he saw the purple wombat on the shore.  Overcome with excitement, Jimmy stood up, but accidently shook the canoe and fell overboard.

Moral of the story: Don't stand up in canoes.

As it happens, his parents never really cared a lot about Timmy and Timmy, knowing this, wasn't expecting much of his special day. He got up in the morning, much against his will, to find his parents in their daily routine. ""Hi kiddo"" was as much as his dad ever bothered to say. Naturally, they had forgotten his birthday.
""Aren't you guys forgetting something?"" he asked. His dad checked if he was wearing pants, which he wasn't, and said he'd put them on when he'd leave for work.
""No, dad!"" Timmy said desperately, ""it's my birthday today!""
""Are you sure?"" his mom doubted.
""Of course I'm sure, jeez!!"" said Timmy frustrated, ""you guys couldn't care less, you don't even know how old i'm turning today""
""Sure I do,"" was dad's confident reply, ""must be eleven by now"".
""Wrong"" said Timmy.
""Nine?"" guessed his mom.
""No, 10! I'm 10! It's my 10th birthday today, you idiots!""

Timmy stormed out into the adjacent living room where he found his grandma, who lived in with them, sat knitting in front of the tv.
""What about you, grandma?"" he asked. Grandma didn't look up from her knitting.
""What about me, Timmy?""
""Do you know how old I'm turning?""

Grandma looked up at him. She put her knitting aside and asked him to come here. She pulled down Timmy's pajama pants. She pulled down his underwear and put his tiny balls and penis in her hand. She felt him gently, pulled his foreskin, jiggled and kneaded his balls a little, seemed to weigh them, sniffed at his penis. After what felt like minutes, she pulled his underwear and pajama pants back up and turned to her knitting again.
""You're turning 10 today"" she said.
Timmy stood there, flabbergasted, lost for words. 
""Wow, grandma, how did you do that?""
""I just heard you tell your parents""",Timmy's 10th birthday.,11
