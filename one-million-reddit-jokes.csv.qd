post,5lx1h7,2qh72,jokes,false,1483504503,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5lx1h7/an_old_persian_joke/,self.jokes,,"Long ago, there lived a poor peasant in the Persian Empire. The man had, some years before, lost his luck. His wife died, his meager wealth ebbed further away, and the poor peasant was on the verge of starvation. Realizing his life was growing grim, he decided that he would find his luck out there in the world and take it back.

Packing what little belongings he had, the man set out on a quest to find his missing luck.

As he walked through a large, open plain, he stumbled upon a lion, which was moaning on the ground. The peasant approached and said, ""what troubles you?""

The lion coughed and responded, ""I am gravely ill, and it seems there is no cure. I seem to have no luck.""

The peasant smiled and said, ""Well, as it so happens, I am on a quest to find my own luck. I am poor and widowed, and I need to get my life back on track.""

The lion looked at the man for a moment, snorted, and said, ""Well, tell you what. You find that luck of yours and ask it how I can be treated. Then we'll both be lucky.""

The man agreed to the lion's sickly request and continued on.

Later, he approached a large tree, where a weeping farmer sat below it. The peasant approached him and asked, ""what troubles you?""

The farmer tearfully responded, ""Why, I'm just about broke. My wife and kids are starving and I have no money to provide for them. It seems my luck's run out.""

The peasant told him of his own missing luck. The farmer gave a small smile and said, ""Well, if you find your luck, could you ask it how we could get our own luck back and get wealthy again?""

The peasant agreed and carried on.

His next stop was at a small village, where the town guards quickly brought him before the village chief. The chief looked the peasant up and down before saying, ""What brings you to my village?"" 

The peasant told the chief of his quest. The chief responded, ""Well, I seem to be out of luck myself. I have no son to rule the village after me. This whole town could fall to disarray! If you find your luck, you ask it what to do about my succession, alright?""

The peasant agreed, and carried on.

At long last the peasant found a small hut. At once, he knew this must be where his luck was. Walking in, he yelled, ""Luck! Are you here?""

Like magic, his luck appeared before him! ""Finally,"" his luck said. ""I've been waiting ages for you! How have you been holding up?""

The peasant told him of his current struggles and that of his journey.

""Well my good friend, I can assure you that your luck has returned. As for the chief, tell him that he needs only to marry his daughter off to a man, and their child will be a son certainly fit to rule the village. For the farmer, simply tell him that the very tree he cries beneath houses an ancient treasure, certain to feed his family for many years. And for the lion, all treatments have failed for a simple reason: he needs the dumbest person alive to treat him.""

The peasant began his return quest home, luck in hand. He first stopped at the village and told the chief of the solution.

""Excellent!"" the Chief exclaimed. ""My luck has returned after all! You can marry my daughter, and the village will be saved!""

The peasant laughed. ""In this dunghole? When my luck just returned? Absolutely not! Good luck to you!"" and the peasant continued on his way.

He then found the crying farmer and told him of the treasure beneath him. ""By Zoroaster! We're saved! Our luck has returned after all! Please, stay with us and share in the treasure! We'll never starve again!""

The peasant laughed. ""My luck has returned, old man. I have no need for such meager treasure when bounties of gold await me!""
The peasant continued on his way home.

He stopped by the dying lion in the grass. ""Well, did you find your luck?"" the lion inquired. 

""Oh, that I did!"" said the peasant. ""I saved a poor farmer by giving him a small treasure, and aided a village chief by telling him to marry off his lovely daughter. Both wanted me to stay, but with the luck I have now? I have no need for such lowly individuals.""

The lion frowned. ""I see. And...did you ask your luck of my plight?""

The peasant beamed. ""Indeed! All you need to do is be treated by the dumbest man alive!""

The lion chuckled. ""Well, they say the best treatment is a good meal. I guess my luck has returned after all!""

And the lion swallowed the peasant whole.",An old Persian joke,89

For weeks this happens, always the same man and always a different kind of sand. The guard is perplexed, but he cannot figure it out and there is no reason to not let the man cross the border, so he ignores it.

Eventually, the wall is torn down, and the guard has to find a new job. Years later, he is having a drink in his favourite bar when he spots a familiar face.

""You!"" The ex-guard says, ""come here. I need you to tell me something.""

And he thought he was the best around

But a new man showed up to give him quite a thrill

For he was spreading word around town

He said “I am the greatest banjo player in the West

And in that I have no doubt

For I can prove I am the very best

All other players I shall clout

Banjo Bill heard the man’s voice

And he drove down towards the square 

He sped down the alley in his Rolls Royce

And stopped at the county fair

The people were gathered in circles by then

Hundreds were in the crowd

The women were clucking loudly like hens

But a darkness began to stir in the clouds

Out of the blue struck lightning and thunder

The crowd began to quiver in fear

They trembled and they shook asunder 

And then Bill’s banjo they began to hear

The chords were fast and mighty

His fingers moved at an incredible pace

The new man shouted “I will fight he,

And I will beat him in this banjo race.”

The strange man picked up his instrument

And stared real hard at Bill

He started to play without incident

So fast he gave the townsfolk chills

Their fingers seemed as if only a blur

Bill had sweat pouring down his face

The man called out “You ignorant cur

It is time you learned your place!”

And with a look of intense concentration

His fingers began to move even faster

“It’s time you received your banjo education

For I am your one true master”

Bill screamed with exertion and collapsed in a heap

His eyes rolled into the back of his head

Control over his bowels Bill could not keep

For sadly Bill was dead

The man started laughing and ran with a hurry

Scooping Banjo Bill right off the ground

For this was the story of Guy Fieri 

And how he claimed another for Flavor town

Granddad just shook his head and said yessir, walked back to me and the tractor and started turning the wrench again as Officer Carson walked off.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

The Mexican opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, burrito again?
The Armenian opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, kebab again?""
The Korean opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, kimchi again?""
The Redneck opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, peanut butter again?""

They eat their lunches and carry on with their work. The following day, the same routine continues. They all moan at the sight of the same lunch packed for them.

They all say to each other, ""If I get the same lunch again tomorrow, then I will jump off the top of the building we are working on."" Then, they carry on with their work.

The next day, the construction workers, hoping they don't have the same lunch open up their lunch boxes one by one.

The Mexican opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, burrito again? So he jumps off the building and dies.
The Armenian opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, kebab again?"" So he jumps off the building and dies.
The Korean opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, kimchi again?"" So he jumps off the building and dies.
The Redneck opens his lunchbox and says, ""Ugh, peanut butter again?"" So he jumps off the building and dies.

A week later, the wives of these construction workers gather at their funeral.

The wife of the Mexican says, ""I thought he loved my burritos."" She begins to cry.
The wife of the Armenian says, ""I thought he loved my kebab."" She begins to cry.
The wife of the Korean says, ""I thought he loved Kimchi."" She begins to cry.

The wife of the Redneck looks at them with a confused gaze. She says, ""I don't know what ya'll talkin' 'bout, but my husband made his own lunches.""",Same Lunch Everyday,40

tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by
St. Peter at the entrance.

""Welcome to Heaven,"" says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there
is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so
we're not sure what to do with you.""

""No problem, just let me in."" says the politician.

""Well, I'd like to but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have
you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to
spend eternity.""

""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven,"" says the head of
state.

""I'm sorry but we have our rules."" And with that, St. Peter escorts the
Republican to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. The doors
open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the
distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other
politicians who had worked with him, everyone is very happy and in evening
dress. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times
they had while getting rich at expense of the people. They play a friendly
game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil
(a politician, too), who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time
dancing and telling jokes.

They are having such a good time that, before he realizes it, it is time to
go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The
elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is
waiting for him.

""Now it's time to visit Heaven."" So 24 hours pass with the politician
joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the
harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24
hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

""Well then, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose
your eternity.""

He reflects for a minute, then the head of state answers: ""Well, I would
never have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I
would be better off in Hell.""

So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to
Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren
land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in
rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes
over to the politician and lays an arm on his neck.

""I don't understand,"" stammers the head of state. Yesterday I was here and
there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced
and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my
friends look miserable.

The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.
Today you voted for us!""",Heaven or Hell?,1777

""The English are clever, but we are twice as smart. From this day forward, we shall take our entire language and mess it all up, AND, we'll add in 10,000 useless words, that'll teach them!!""

Lives Adam and Eve without any clothes.

In this garden were two little leaves.

One covered Adam and one covered Eve.

As the story goes on, never the less to say,

Along came the wind and blew the leaves away.

At the sight Adam did stare, 

There was Eve's treasure all covered with hair.

And wonder came into Eve's eyes,

As Adam's thing started to rise.

They found a spot, which suited them best,

A nice big tree where they began to rest

Her legs spread wider and wider apart,

While thrill after thrill came into her heart.

The head of Adam's thing peaked into her hole,

And filled her with passion beyond her control.

Backwards and forwards his thing did slide,

Until Eve's treasure was all wet inside.

The joy was good, she wouldn't let loose,

Until Adam's thing was all out of juice.

He went on to say that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and all you do is load your pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and he was going to try it again. Horrified, she asked if he ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned him.
He told her no, He stepped off a curb to sniff a poodle's butt and a car hit him.

He was delighted, but his bequest was dependent on a single condition: that he had to spend $10,000 of that fortune the night of the will's reading. Sort of a Brewster's Millions type of situation, ya know?

So, ten grand in hand, Eric went to the most obvious place a man would go to blow thousands of dollars: the brothel. When he reached the building, the woman in the lobby explained the deal: a thousand dollars per tryst. He found this reasonable, and asked to buy time with ten women.

The lady shook her head and said, ""Sorry kiddo, but I've only got nine women working tonight. I mean, if you want, we've got a few men working if you want to take one of them."" Curious, Eric asked, ""Okay, what men do you have?""
""We've got Alan in room 2B, Evan in room 1F, and Eric in room 2D.""
Well, he felt kinda weird doing it with a guy with the same name as him, so he decided against Eric. It also seemed a bit creepy to sleep with a guy who had his dead father's name, so Alan was off the table.

So, Bush did nine and Evan.",So this guy Eric Bush's father Alan died last Saturday,3

I made the rounds, going from bar to bar until closing time. As I was weaving my way out of the last bar I was invited to an after bar party by a group of fellow revelers.
  Not ready to call it a night I gladly accepted the invitation offered by the kind strangers. We all crowded into a van and, whooping and hollering, we made our way to the party. Driving into an old neighborhood full of fine old houses we presently stopped and piled out of the van. As I walked up the sidewalk to the Victorian house I noticed the front door was painted a bright fluorescent orange, which struck me as an unusual color to paint a door.
  I don't remember too much of the party as a night of drinking had created a fog inside my mind. One thing I do remember was the room suddenly spinning and my stomach churning and I decided to locate a bathroom so as not to embarrass myself by parking my cookies in public.
 Staggering down a hallway I opened a door and luckily it was an unoccupied half bathroom that contained a brass toilet. I made it there just in time as I began to empty the contents of my stomach into the gleaming brass stool as soon as I closed the door. After what seemed an eternity I felt somewhat better and walked out of the bathroom. 
  The next thing I remember I was waking up on the floor of my apartment at 2 p.m. this afternoon. After a shower I realized how famished I was. Not having anything to eat at home I decided to eat out somewhere. I grabbed my keys and my wallet but couldn't locate my cell phone. After a thorough search of my apartment I reluctantly came to the conclusion that I had lost my phone somewhere between the last bar I was in (I remembered using it just before closing time) and my apartment.
  Retracing my steps seemed impossible as I had no idea how I got home from the after the bar party. The party! I must have dropped my phone in the bathroom while I was being sick!
 Knowing the general area that the party was at but not the specific house I went to that neighborhood and slowly drove up and down the streets trying to remember anything about the house where the party was at when I suddenly saw a fluorescent orange door. I had forgotten all about the door! That had to be the house!
 Being anxious to retrieve my phone, I hurried up the walk and knocked on the door. A tired looking lady opened the door and asked me what I wanted. I explained to her that I had little lost my phone and that I had been at a party in the neighborhood the night before and that the only thing I remembered about the house was that it had a fluorescent orange door and a brass toilet and I was wondering if my phone was there.
The lady turned and yelled into the house "" hey Harry, I found the guy that puked in your tuba!""

A first-grade teacher, Ms Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students.  The teacher asked, ""Harry, what's your problem?"" 

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is!  I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""

Ms. Brooks had enough.  She took Harry to the principal's office. 

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed. 

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. 

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. 

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! 

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?"" 

Harry: ""Pants.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. 

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling. 

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the 
teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong.""",The trouble with Harry,19
