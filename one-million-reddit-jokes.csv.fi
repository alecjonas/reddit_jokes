The young guy nods. ""I think I can do that!""

He goes back out and has a few more drinks for luck, but can't bring himself to actually speak to anyone. 

As the night dwindles, it's just Our Hero and one lonely woman sitting at the bar.  He takes a final shot, stands up, and staggers over to her. 

She sees him and smiles. He smiles back and slurs, ""Stick a feather up your ass, baby?""

Repulsed, she cries, ""Ew what?!""

Our man reels back, points a finger at the sky and cries, ""GODDAMN LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS!""","""Tickle your a** with a feather?""",4

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your business at this convention?”
“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”
“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”
“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican descent who are the best.

He wanted to tell his young child some core life morals, as well as teach about old technology.

The wise man first showed the kid a polaroid camera. The kid quickly took it, and snapped a photo, but was very confused when the picture did not immediately show. The kid did everything to the picture to try and make it develop, but it didn't speed up, and when the photo did develop, the photo was fuzzy and unreadable. The wise old man put his hand on the shoulder, and told his apprentice that ""memories take a long time to form, but are very fickle.""

The wise old man then showed the kid a flip phone, and the kid immediately tried to send a text, but the cell phone didn't send messages very well. He was eventually unable to send messages due to reaching a bandwidth limit. The kid seemed confused, but once again, the wise old man put his hand on the kid's shoulder, and told them that ""Sometimes, it is better to say a little than it is to say a lot.""

Finally, the wise old man showed the kid a fax machine, which the kid almost immediately recognized. He tried to use the built-in scanner to copy a drawing he had made earlier, but yet the scanner would not print the image. The kid began to cry. Seeing an opportunity for a very important lesson, the man told them to keep crying, if for a little bit, and try again. The kid, still distraught and confused, decided to oblige. The scanner did not print once again. The man then told the kid to stop crying, and try one more time. Of course, the scanner did not work. At this point, the kid decided to read the error in detail, and saw it was out of paper. Refilling the paper, the scan went flawlessly. The man put his hand on his shoulder of the kid, and told his apprentice that ""Fax don't care about your feelings"".",The Computer Nerd and His Apprentice,27

And all of you son of a bitches who want to change seats, change seats now 'cause the train's getting ready to leave. Whoo whooooo.""

The mother was just devastated, so she scolded her son and said to him,

""Now son, I want to go upstairs and take your nap, and when you get up, you can't play with your train set for two hours.""

So the boy took his nap and didn't even mention his train set for two hours. After the two hours were up, the boy asked his mom if he could play with his train set again. She said yes, and asked him if he understood why he was punished. He nodded his head yes, and off he went. The mother stood by door to listen to what her son would say. The boy sat down to his train set and calmly said,

""Whoo whoooooo. All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get on the train, get on the train. All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get off the train, get off the train. And all you son of a bitches who are pissed 'cause the train is two hours late, go talk to the bitch in the kitchen.

No one can see the piece before it is completed.

Begrudgingly, the town council accepts, a contract is signed, and the artist begins work behind a massive curtain. The artist goes so far as to hire a security firm who have signed non disclosure agreements. 

After 4 months of work, the mural is complete. A massive unveiling is planned. The local media, the high school band, the entire town, and the state governor are all in attendance. 

With much fanfair, the curtain is dropped. The 60 foot wide by 20 foot tall mural is revealed. 

The mural depicts a beautiful scene of the American Southwest, filled with brilliant colors and amazing details. There are hundreds of Native Americans in amazingly accurate period correct clothing from the late 1800's. Everyone is in awe... Until they start looking a little closer.

Many of the the Native Americans are in various stages of undress. They are all engaged in coitus in every position and combination imaginable. All in photograph- quality detail. But it gets worse. 

Interspersed throughout the scene of debauchery, there are enormous piles of feces. Fly-ridden and festering in the sun. After a moment of focusing on it, you could swear you could smell it. The piles of waste have beams of golden light descending from the heavens onto them. Some of the piles even have halos above them. 

Everyone is now silent, mouths agape at what they're seeing. Finally, the governor bellows out, ""What have you done here? This is disgusting! Explain yourself!""

The artist calmly replied, ""I did exactly what was asked of me. I have painted a piece of art depicting an important moment in American history. This represents the last words uttered by General George Custer at the battle of Litttle Big Horn."" 

Holy shit. Look at all those fucking Indians.

The first guys says, ""No I'm serious. On a windy day, like today, the surrounding buildings create this strange air current near the ground which cushions your fall. You land gently on your feet, light as a feather.""

The second guy says, ""Riiiight. And I'm sure you've done this before?""

First guy says, ""Sure, all the time. But I can tell you don't believe me. Listen, I'll bet you $1,000 that I can jump off the Empire State Building and survive. But if I do survive, you have to try it next.""

The second guy thinks about it for a while and says, ""Okay. I'll feel pretty bad when you die, but it's a free country, and I could certainly use $1,000.""

After shaking hands on the bet they both leave the bar and head to the top of the Empire State Building. The first guy steps up to the edge like he's done it hundred times and says, ""Okay, here I go!""

Believing the first guy would chicken out, and worried the bet has gone a little too far, the second guy lunges towards the first and tries to grab him. But it's too late. He watches the man fall for what seems like forever. Just as he's about to turn his head away from the impending disaster, he notices the first man start to slow down. And if by magic, he sees him gently land on his feet.

The first guy makes his way back up to the top of building and is greeted by the second guy who rushes over to him, hugs him, and says ""You're alive! That was amazing! How? What? I can't even.""

The first guy says, ""See I told you! Now, how about that $1,000? And remember, we agreed that if I survived you would do it next.""

The second guy nods his head and happily hands over the $1,000, feeling like it's a small investment for the money he'll make from the same bet with other people. Moments later he finds himself standing on the edge, and takes the leap.

The first man watches the second falling for what seems like forever, and just then.... SPLAT...

Minutes later the first guy walks back into the same bar, sits down, and orders a drink.

The bartender looks up from the glass he's drying and with a stern look on his face says, ""You know Superman, you can be a real dick sometimes""","A guy walks into a seedy bar in NYC, sits down, and says to the guy next to him, ""Did you know you can jump off the Empire State Building and survive the fall?""...",60

The other hunter is very amused about the idea, and so they execute their plan, putting rabbit intestines in their sleeping friend's pants.

As the morning dawns, the two pranksters meet each other outside their tents. Both grinning far and wide, they decide to check on their friend. However, the man is not in his tent! Fortunately, they soon notice their friend coming from the woods, waving a stick.

After 10 minutes had passed, a police cruiser with two constables and an animal control van with two animal control officers arrive on the scene and begin their duties.

The two animal control officers quickly get to work with lifting the behemoth swine into their van, while the two constables interview the farmer on what happened. The farmer tells his story, giving every single detail of what happened and claims that the death of his pig was due to the pesticides he may have used for dusting his crops, but suggests the officers that they should investigate further as the farmer tells them that strangers have been coming onto his property at the late hours of the evening trying to sneak away with a new crop the farmer had recently planted. The constables agree and confer with the AC officers to give them details upon their findings as they perform an autopsy at their control centre.

A few days pass and the constables receive news from animal control via phone call and tell them they are sending the dissected pig to their morgue for further examination. Ten minutes later, the same two AC officers arrive with the pig in the van and are led by the constables to the morgue with two large Tupperware containers in hand. They arrive in the morgue and begin to pull out the carcass, piece by piece onto the gurney in front of them. Then one of the AC officers pulls out three plastic bags full of greenery covered in mucus. One of the constables askes what they are and the AC officers says it's marijuana. The constables rush the bags of assumed marijuana to the laboratory for further examination and the results were the greenery in the bags were indeed marijuana.

Relieved that their findings were true, one of the constables phones the farmer to give the news. The farmer answers the phone and the constable tells him of his findings.

""Sir, we have some news on your late pig,"" the constable starts, ""after our findings from animal control, we have found that your swine ate a plentiful amount of greenery which caused the sudden death of it.""

""And? Was it resulted from some pesticide I had used?"" The farmer questioned very curiously.

""Fortunately, no,"" the constable begins, ""your pig ingested a heavy amount of marijuana which in turn caused your pig to overdose.""

The farmer relieved by the constable's news, made light of the situation, saying, ""Well, I guess I finally figured out what breed of pigs I'm raising.""

""And what breed would that be, sir?"" The constable asks.

The farmer let out a hearty chuckle before he replied, ""Pot-bellied pigs.""

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your business at this convention?”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”
“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed.

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

The moral of the story - Pay your bills !!

",Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts,69

Inside appeared to be different produce stands, but, strangely, all he saw were bakery stuffs on the shelves. One was covered in pies and labeled ""Pineapple Pies - $2/lb."" Another was covered in pastries and labeled ""Cherry Tarts - $0.85/lb."" And on and on it went: ""Banana Biscuits - $1.15/lb."" ""Lemon Loaves - $2.95/lb."" etc. etc.

An attendant, who was stocking what looked like Watermelon Muffins, asked Bill, ""Finding everything okay?""

""What is this place, exactly?""

""It's a baked fruit stand! We sell nothing but fruit, but they only are sold baked into our wonderful doughs and pastries.""

""Wow!"" replied Bill. ""That's a cool idea! Is there anything you recommend?""

""Absolutely! Our Orange Cookies are to die for! They're our most popular product! But, unfortunately, the farmers who reap our fruits haven't been able to grow enough oranges to keep them in stock.""

Just then, a pickup truck pulled up to the shop and out came three individuals dressed in overalls and sun hats to unload crates from out the back. 

""Who are they?""

""Those are the farmers and bakers who supply our stock. They're actually native to this land, so not only are they our suppliers, but they actually own the grounds on which the market was built.""

Bill looked over the crates and remarked, ""Doesn't look like they have any Orange Cookies today, either. Do they restock the same time everyday?""

""Yes, sir,"" replied the attendant, ""every day at 8.""

""Great! Then I will see you tomorrow.""

So Bill headed over to the market the next day, just as the farmers finished unloading the last crate. 

He noticed the empty shelf and asked the attendant, ""No Orange Cookies today?""

The attendant replied, while shaking his head, ""Nope, I'm afraid not.""

Bill mumbled under his breath, ""So frustrating..."" as he walked out of the shop. 

The next day, Bill returned while the farmers were still unloading the day's stock. 

The attendant looked over at him as he asked, ""Got any Orange Cookies today?""

The attendant simply frowned and shook his head.

Bill grumbled, a little louder this time, ""Useless farmers...""

Again, the next day Bill arrived in the middle of the farmers unloading their truck. He walked straight up to the attendant, who looked at him with a sad expression on his face. 

""I'm sorry, sir, no Orange Cookies today, neither.""

Bill began to bluster frustratedly, then turned to the farmers and yelled, ""*WHAT GOOD ARE YOU!?!*""

The attendant immediately stomped his foot and pointed his finger right in Bill's face as he said, ""Hey! I understand you come here for the OC, but there's no need to bad-mouth our reap hosts!""",The New Market on the Corner,10

First they pick the German and pull him out of the cell away from the others. The next day they bring him back with bruises and cuts everywhere and he says: ""I have failed, I told them everything.""

Next they pick the Japanese. Two days later they bring him back badly beaten up and in a bad condition. He says: ""I have dishonored the emperor and i dont deserve this life! I told them everything.""

Now they pick the Italian, who is already crying and asking for mercy. For two weeks they don't hear anything from the Italian and start wondering what happened to him.
Then they bring him back, in a horrible condition, barely alive and the guard says: ""I would have never believed that you guys would speak and the Italian is the one who wouldn't say a word to us.""
They throw him back in the cell and the German and the Japanese rush to him and ask what happened and why he didn't say anything.

The Italian answeres: ""I wanted to tell them everything! But then they tied my hands behind my back!""

It's kind of chaotic at the domestic arrivals terminal at YVR. Air Canada and WestJet flights are arriving from all over the country, bringing CFL fans from everywhere, many of whom are already fully dressed in their team's colours and partying it up.

An American couple is also there, having recently arrived to Vancouver to catch a cruise ship that's on a short, repositioning trip, and they have no idea what's going on. They're looking at all of the craziness around them, and spot a couple of Rider Nation fans, fully decked-out as only Roughrider fans can be; dressed in green and white from head to toe, faces painted green and white, horns, cowbells, the whole deal.

The puzzled wife says to her husband,

""I wonder where they're from?""

""No idea"", he replies.

""Well, why don't you go ask?""

""Yeah, ok.""

So the husband walks over to them and says...

""Excuse me, sir... my wife and I were just wondering... where you folks from?""

""Saskatoon, Saskatchewan!"", the man proudly announces.

The man goes back to his wife.

""What'd he say?"", she asks.

""I don't know -- they don't speak English.""

The priest replied ""By all means, go ahead.""

The boy tried to pull on the rope to ring the bell, but he was too weak and the rope wouldn't budge. Then he got an idea. He walks to the edge of the tower, then sprints full speed into the bell, which then lets out a loud boom. Disoriented, the boy ends up stumbling off of the tower, landing on the ground below. 

When an ambulance arrives, a paramedic asks the priest ""Did you know this boy, Father?""

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",Surprise dinner for the wife (long),3

There once was this guy who was going on a date to the movies with a beautiful girl. Before he went, he made the mistake of eating a jumbo can of beans. Right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies.

When they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and Coke. She said sure, so he went to the restroom. The line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre.

When the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. So he figures he can wait until he drops her off.

When they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''Oh goodie. My grandparents are here. Come on in and meet them.''

He agrees, although his A-hole is about to cry at this point.

They go in and sit down at the table. Finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. As he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog Duke, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. The girl's father stands up and hollers ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.

''Great!'' he thought. ''They really think it's the dog!'' So, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers.

Once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.

Finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most hair-curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. The girl's father stands up again. ''Duke, get the hell out from under him before he shits on you!!''",There once was this guy......,11

Deeply demoralized, he orders a pint at the bar as tears of shame well up in his eyes.



Another patron notices this man, approaches, places a warm hand on his shoulder, and says, ""I think you've captured the spirit of the song perfectly.  John would be quite proud.""



Eyes widening, the singer looks at his guest, ""P-- Paul McCartney?!?!?""




Paul smiles and nods.  ""Shh.  Now... it's not often that I see such a loving tribute to my band's music, so I tell you what I'm going to do.  When we became more famous than Jesus, let's just say that we acquired a few divine powers.  I am going to give you the ability to absolutely crush any Beatles song that you perform in public from here on out, provided you have a pint in your hand and drink a toast to me beforehand.""




Incredulous, the guy watches as Paul waves his hand and magicky sparks fly out.  With a burst of confidence, he toasts Paul and gets back up on the stage, pint in hand.  The crowd recognizes him and starts to boo, but as he launches into Norwegian Wood, the crowd is mezmerized by the utter beauty of the performance.  Thunderous applause follows.  He follows up with another toast to Paul and a performance of Revolution, which leaves the crowd absolutely PUMPED!  Victorious, he goes home for the night.




Days later, he tries his luck again at a different pub.  He orders a pint, toasts Paul (wherever he may be), launches into a performance of While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the mic, and the crowd can't get enough of it, going absolutely crazy.




Before long, he has achieved a certain degree of fame for this talent of his.  He makes his way onto a televised talent show.  As he is nervously waiting behind stage, he realizes... he doesn't have his pint!  The man calls a stagehand over and aggressively says, ""Beer!  I need beer!  There's beer in the green room, right?""




""Uhhh... not beer, sir,"" the stagehand says, a bit frightened.  ""But we do have booze.""




""Damn!  What kinds of booze do you have?""




""I can make you a margarita, a vodka and Red Bull, or a rum and coke.""




""Hrm... make me the vodka and Red Bull.  And hurry!""




It's his turn to go on stage.  Nervously, he toasts Paul with his mixed drink and goes on stage to sing Eleanor Rigby.  However, the wrong words come out.  He starts crooning, ""Someone's knockin' at the door.  Somebody's ringin' the bell...""



The music stops awkwardly and he starts over.  Again, the wrong words come out.  ""When you were young, and your life was an open book...""




The crowd starts to boo.  Frantically, the man looks around and lo and behold - he sees Paul McCartney sitting in the audience!  ""Paul!  You've got to help me!!!  What went wrong?!?!""



Paul shakes his head and points at the drink.  ""Red Bull gives you Wings.""",[Shaggy dog] Beatles karaoke (OC!),1

He was still missed by his brother since he loved him despite his ways.

Finally, years later, the good brother died and went to Heaven. Everything was beautiful and wonderful there and he was very happy. One day he asked God where his brother was, as he hadn’t seen him there. God said that he wassorry but his brother lived a terrible life and went to Hell instead.

The good brother then asked God if there was any way for him to see his brother. So God gave him the power of vision to see into Hell and there was his brother. He was sitting on a bench with a keg of beer under one arm and a gorgeous blonde on the other.

Confused, the good brother said to God, “I am so happy that you let me into Heaven with You. It is so beautiful here and I love it. But I don’t understand, if my brother was bad enough to go to Hell, why does he have the keg of beer and a gorgeous blonde. It hardly seems like a punishment”.

He's decided to put flies into the beers of a customers, to measure and document the reactions of people of different nationalities.  Since he fancies himself as a chivalrous gentleman, he doesn't do this with female customers (actually, he doesn't want to ruin any chance he has of getting them into his bed, or the back room.)  So his targets are men.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is his experiment journal.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday:

Subject #1: Englishman, age approximately 40.  Called me over and said he couldn't drink the beer because of the fly and demanded another on the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #2: Welshman, age approximately 50-60.  Called me over and flicked the fly at me while swearing in Welsh.  Then he started sipping his beer as if nothing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday:

Subject #3: Irishman, age approximately 65.  Was so drunk that he didn't notice the fly, gulping it down with the beer, then ordered another ""jus' da same"".  I obliged him.  Four more flies later, he settled his tab, and made his way out of the bar in a less than straight line.

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #4: American, age approximately 25.  Yelled at me to come back, threw the beer in my face, and started a bar brawl.

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday: Dedicated to repairing bar, no customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday:

Subject #5: Scotsman, age approximately 35.  Horrified upon seeing the fly (I think you know where this is going), picked it out of the beer and screamed at it repeatedly, ""Spit it out!  Spit it out!"".  For the next beer, he demanded an extra ounce on the house, on account of the fly having drunk some of his previous beer.

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #6: Canadian, age approximately 25-30.  Very quiet.  When he paid for his beer, the fly was on the Euro bills and he said, ""No thank you.  You can have the fly back.""

&amp;#x200B;

Friday:

Subject #7: German, age approximately 30-40.  Demanded to see the manager and complained to her that I had dishonoured his fine beverage.  Suggested to my manager that I was unfit for my job, and that he deserved the most expensive beer we have for free as compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager questioned me about the fly, suspicious.  She's smarter than I thought, despite her not sleeping with me.  She asked me about the brawl on Tuesday, if I had done something to set off the American.  I said it might be possible, but who knows what sets them off?  She agreed, but warned me that if anything goes wrong during my shift again, I would lose my employee discount.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday:

&amp;#x200B;

The owner is working today instead of the manager.  Since the manager won't sleep with the owner either, he probably doesn't know about the fly incident.  Onward with my experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #8: Iranian, age approximately 20-50.  Saw the fly, then praised Allah for showing him the error of his ways, then left.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner didn't want the beer to go to waste, so put it into the refrigerator.  He didn't notice the fly.

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #9: Sudanese refugee, age 42.  For some reason my knowing his age was important, like he was bragging.  I gave him the beer that the owner put in the fridge.  When he saw the fly, he started yelling loudly that he shouldn't be treated this way, that he should get the same as everyone else.  The owner came over to see what was going on.  He asked me why I was treating the refugee differently, I said that I wasn't, that I had been putting flies in most of the beers.  He laughed and repeated this to the refugee, who spluttered and swore on his way out the door.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why are you putting flies in the beer?"", asked the owner.  I told him about my experiment, minus the bar brawl.  Obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, it's just beer, the cretins, they should have wine like us French.  They deserve it,"" he replied, ""but don't do it too much.  I don't want to lose too many customers.""

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""I'm only doing it to foreigners, but it would be interesting to see the reaction of a fellow Frenchman, if ever one orders a beer.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't you dare put a fly in the wine!"", growled the owner.

&amp;#x200B;

""Of, course Monsieur, I would never stoop so low!""

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday:

&amp;#x200B;

Subject #10: A dark coloured American woman, age approximately 20-30.  I broke my no women rule for her because she was extremely rude when I innocently asked her to the back room.  When she saw the fly, she started screaming in some version of English that I couldn't understand, threw the beer at the owner (who came in specifically today to watch my experiment), jumped over the bar and hit me over the head with the beer stein.  She and her 5 other young dark coloured American friends then started rampaging, smashing everything in sight.  After what seemed like an eternity, they grabbed what few bottles were left unbroken and the cash from the cash box, before running out into the street.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday:

&amp;#x200B;

The bar owner is in the hospital bed beside mine.  He says that he has been telling me repeatedly that I am fired, but I keep forgetting it because of my head injury.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a dad whose response was very odd to stuff asked by his son.

S: Can I ride my bike to school?

D: Does your dick touch your asshole?

S: No

D: Well there's your answer

So on and so forth, ""Can I date girls?"", ""Can I smoke?"", ""Can I skip school today?""

One day the kid $10,000 in the lottery and dad starts eyeing the money.

D: Can I get some of the $10,000

S: Does your dick touch your asshole?

Dad thinking he'd outsmart the kid.

D: Yes it very much does

An old couple reminiscing of their younger days decide they'd visit all the places they did it. They go to the beach, the park, the zoo and many others and finally they reach the house of their old neighbors. The house has been sold to a young man and the old man tells him what they are doing and he is more than happy to let them into his backyard. The old couple reminisces while the young man hides and listens in on them.

OM: I can just remember it like it was yesterday, it's great we decided to visit all the places. It was 30 years ago wasn't it?

OW: Honey, all these memories have tingled me, why not we do it here now.

OM: I am up for it.

And they proceed to start making love and the OW grabs the fence and the OM starts jerking like the devil has possessed him. They go about it for 15 mins and finally fall down to the ground. The young man comes out

YM: Wow, you guys have definitely not lost to age. What's your secret? Even I can't perform so well, I can't imagine what you did 30 years ago.

OM: 30 years ago the fence wasn't electrified.

One day some soldiers were being discharged. These guys had been through hell in a Afghanistan, so the big bosses decided to reward them more than just a pension. So they said ""Guys measure anywhere on your body and for every inch you'll get $100, this is the least we can do"". 

S1: I'd like to be measured from the top of my head to my foot please. (Measured 80 inches got $8000)

S2: I'd like it from the tip of my fingers to the tip of my toes.(Measure 100 inches got $10,000)

S3: I'd like to be measured from the tip of my penis to my balls please.

Big Brass: Are you sure? Pick something else

S3: Nope, please measure. 

So they begin to measure, 4,5,6 inches....

Big Brass: S3 where are your balls?

S3: Back in Afghanistan sir!",Some nsfw funnies I remembered,10

20 minutes into the flight, a shudder is felt through the plane and the pilot comes on the loudspeaker, ""Folks, we have just lost power in one of our engines. Should be nothing to worry about, we will still be landing safely very soon"". Bart shrugged off the incident and figured if that's the worst thing that happens today, it would still be a success.

A half hour later, another shudder went through the plane, the passengers gasped, and the pilot came on the PA again. ""Friends, we have lost power to another engine. We still have two functioning engines, and we should have no problems reaching our destination. We apologize for the issues."" Bart was starting to feel slightly uneasy now, but was still confident they would reach Berlin.

Later, about 20 minutes out from their destination, another vibration was felt and the plane listed to the right for a few moments, then stabilized. The pilot made another announcement, this time more nervously, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost power to a third engine. We still hope to make it to Berlin safely, please remain calm."" Bart and the other passengers were now visibly shaken, praying that the last functional engine held out until they could land.

Thankfully, the plane reached Berlin and landed safely. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as they taxied to the gate and began to deplane. As Bart gathered his things, he laughed and remarked to the man seated next to him, ""It's a good thing we didn't lose that last engine, or we would have been up there all night!""",A Polish man from a small village is flying for the first time.,1

The priest for the church put out a flyer for a new bell ringer. Sure enough, the next day the priest heard a knock at his door. He opens the door, and standing there is an armless man. The man says he’d like to apply for the bell ringing job. The priest asks the man how he hopes to ring the bell without arms, and the man tells him not to worry. So, reluctantly, the priest takes the man all the way up the bell tower and lets the man show him what he can do. The man takes 5 steps back, and runs into the bell with all his might. *BONG* He takes 5 more steps back and runs at it again. *BONG* He takes 7 steps back this time, runs at the bell, whiffs it, and falls aaaaaalllll the way down the bell tower. Splat. He’s dead. The people nearby help the priest drag his body to the center of town. A crowd forms and people ask the priest, “Who was this man, Father? What was his name?”

The priest says, “ I don’t know his name...but his face rings a bell.”","So there was a church in 1654AD,",3

Intrigued, Bob approaches the man and asks him, ""Good sir, for what good reason are you jumping on this manhole cover, and what does 'Fifty!' mean?""

The man stops jumping for a moment and, out of breath, excitedly tells Bob, ""This is great exercise, and it makes me feel really good. Fifty is as high as I can count, so I just repeat that number. It's not the number that matters, I'll just stop when I get tired!"" The man continues jumping on the manhole cover and yelling ""Fifty!"".

Bob has been feeling a bit out of shape lately, and seeing that this man is obviously in peak physical condition, he decides that he wants to try this new exercise regimen. He gets the man's attention again and asks, ""Sir, would you mind taking a short rest while I try this out?"" The man smiles broadly and graciously steps off the manhole cover. ""Of course, my friend! I only hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!""

Bob steps onto the manhole cover, and after feeling that it is solid, begins to jump and count, ""One!, Two!, Three!"" 

""Jump as high as you can! Really get into it!"", urges the man.

Bob is now jumping as high as he can, ""Four!, Five!, Six!""

At the height of Bob's seventh leap, the man quickly bends down and snatches the manhole cover out of its hole, sending Bob straight down into the sewer below, a 20-foot drop. The man quickly replaces the manhole cover, looks around, sees that nobody has been watching, and continues his jumping.

They don’t know each other and don’t know where they are. Soon, they get very hungry. They go into the island to see if they can find any food. They happen to stumble upon an enormous cache of perfectly ripe fruits. They eat to their heart’s delight, and when they are all about to fall asleep, five enormous, muscled, tattooed people step out, wielding clubs.
“You have stolen from our people! We shall take you to our leader, for he will know what to do.” 
So the men are dragged to the center of the island, and soon face the leader of the tribe they were taken captive by.
“You have stolen from our people! This is punishable by death! However, since you are foreigners, I have another option for you. iki Shiki.” 
The first man asks, “What is iki Shiki?!” 
“I know it by no other name. The choice is yours. Death, or iki Shiki.”
The first man says this, “Well, nothing is worse than death. So I choose iki Shiki!”
“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!! IKI SHIKI!”
The man is dragged into a cave by three hulking warriors, even bigger than the ones that took them to the chief. For a few moments, there is complete silence. And then, the other two men hear something. “Oh god! What are you doing?! No! NO! STOP! PLEASE! PLEASE, OH GOD PLEASE!!” Then they start hearing awful screams, like nothing on this earth. This goes on for six hours. Finally, the man stops screaming. He exits the cave, pants off.  Blood is streaming out of his ass and flecks of shit cover him. He sits down and starts crying immediately. The second man is then given the same choice. 
“Well, that seems pretty horrible. But nothing can be worse than death. So I too choose iki Shiki.”
“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!! IKI SHIKI!” 
The same warriors drag the second man into the cave. The iki Shiki has begun. The second man starts screaming. He keeps on screaming, never stopping, and the first man starts crying harder and harder. After eight hours, the second man comes out of the cave. His clothes are ripped to shreds and blood is covering his entire body. He lies down in fetal position and starts shaking violently. 
The third and final man then must choose his fate. “Well, before today, I thought nothing was worse than death. But I was wrong. So that is what I choose.”
“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!!! DEATH! BY IKI SHIKI!!!!!!”
