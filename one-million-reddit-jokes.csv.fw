The manager would allow it and keep the shop open a little longer to accommodate his obsession.

The next day, the farmer walks in and stares in awe at the bright red tractor. 5 hours he stands and stares, he can’t get enough of it. The manager tells him “we’re closing buddy”. The farmer asks for just 10 more minutes. The manager allows him to stay a little longer and then escorts him out the building.

The next day the farmer comes into the shop again and stares at the tractor. “Not you again” shouts the manager. He strides up to the farmer and says “look pal this is ridiculous, no one can love tractors this much, you have to find a new hobby. It’s pathetic”

The farmer begins to well up and runs out the store straight back to his farmhouse. He says to himself “that manager is right, I need a fresh start” so he packs up all his things into his car, leaving behind his old tractor, his field, his house, everything. “I’m going to make it in the big city” he says.

It’s a long drive away so he stops at a supermarket on the way to get some supplies. Once inside he notices a bit of dust falling from the roof. He just keeps on shopping, eager to start his new life. All of the sudden the roof starts to collapse in and so he runs out the door and dives onto the pavement outside.

He can hear the screams of the people inside, passers on the pavement are trying to help but they can’t see anything with all of the dust every where. 

The farmer shouts “STAND BACK” as he takes one massive breath in and sucks all the dust up, exposing those still in the building. Others bravely rush to the rescue and save those trapped in the building. One by one everyone is saved and start applauding the farmer.

“That was incredible!” Says one man “how can you do that!?”

The farmer says “I’m an Ex-tractor fan”

Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face. The father realizes the boy has swallowed the coins and starts slapping him on the back. The boy coughs up two of the nickels but keeps choking. Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, attractive, and serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading on her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.
Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy’s’ testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last nickel, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman hands the nickel to the father and walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, “I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?”

“No,” the woman replied. “I work for the IRS.”",A father walks into a restaurant with his young son. [long],6

They walk together down a dark corridor for what seems like hours. Until the man sees a dimly lit lamp shining against the wall to reveal two doors. Hades claps his hand and as if on sync the doors open at the same time. 
To the mans disgust, his eyes meet two rooms. One people are chatting at a table drinking coffee, but this is the underworld he thinks to himself. Somethings not right. He looks around the room to find their feet to be submerged in thick icky sewage water. 
Hades patients grows week he grabs the man by the shoulder to let him see the other room. This room is also filled with people, but their feet are tied up to the ceiling.... and their HEADS are hanging above the sewer water. Some are too tall to even have their heads hang above.
“ALRIGHT” Hades voice booms the entire hallway. “This isnt a museum young man, you have two options here. The first room with those fine gentleman drinking coffee. Or the men over there being hung by their feet. Hurry up and pick boy, i dont have all day.”
The man panics as he’s quite tall and his head would submerge in the sewage he also just arrived a few hours ago. 
“Well at least those men are drinking coffee. They’re still sitting in sewer water, but I’ll join the first roo-“
“WONDERFUL now lets get you seated, and I’ll introduce you to these fine men who i dont even know because i don’t actually care.” Hades gets the man a cup of coffee, and leads him in shutting the doors. The man joins the others at the table as they start to chat and play cards. Everyone is laughing, banging the table, and slapping cards. The sewage water is going to take some time for the man to get used to. The smell makes him nauseous. 
“Hey man your up its your turn to deal” one of the guys across the table hands the man the deck of cards. 
The man cant help but hesitate and think. If Hades gives options out of those the two choices I got. Why would someone choose the other room? The man shakes the thought out of his head and starts to deal the cards. The men chant and make so much noise that sends a ringing through the mans ears.
All the sudden a loud shriek of the intercom pauses the scene. 
“ALL RIGHT YOU FOOLS BREAK TIME IS OVER CHOP CHOP!” 
The men stand up, and walk down to the other end of the room. There is a rope for each one of them, and they help each other tie their feet to the rope. 

The man suddenly realizes that both rooms are the same. ",One day a man dies.,4

Naturally deciding to stop at his usual convenient store. As he's pulling into the parking lot he sees a woman pumping gas into her car while smoking a cigarette. She was older and maybe a little unstable. The cop dismounts his cruiser and approaches the woman to remind her not to smoke around the pumps due to obvious reasons.


She immediately goes ballistic on him. Screaming and shouting to mind his own business and calling him several names. He tried to calm her but that only seemed to worsen the situation. She then pulls the nozzle from her car and starts spraying gasoline everywhere primarily at the cop, luckily he was too far away. Mind you this lady still had her cigarette in her hand.


Somehow she drenched her arm with gasoline and sure enough she caught fire. She was blazing. The screams were unlike anything the cop has heard in his life. She starts running and flailing her arms around. In a split second he decided to draw his weapon and fire. The screaming stopped and she fell to the ground, still burning. From there he called it in, seriously doubting his decision.

His fellow officers detained him for questioning. Later that night he was pulled into the interrogation room. This is when it starts to hit him. ""I fucked up"". They were relentless, he's never felt so terrible in his life. The cops CO comes into the room, he asked him straight up ""why did you shoot her"" he replied with ""sir I had to, she was dangerous"" ""how?"" He replied.

The cop stared him straight in the eyes, tears streaming down his face ""Because she was waving her firearms around, sir.""

So here he is. Waiting.

""Now that you have gathered your fruit, you are ready for the second task: You must silently insert all ten of your ten fruit up your butt. If you make any noise, or cannot complete the task, than you will be beheaded.""

In a desperate ploy the zoo decides to hire a new position. They hire an ambitious young man to dress up as a gorilla.  

""It's an easy job"", they explain in the interview. ""Climb up and down the ropes, swing on the tire swing, beat your chest, that sort of thing. Put on a show"".

Well the young man puts on the gorilla suit and gets started. He's timid at first but soon discovers he's got a knack for it. The tire swing is actually kind of fun. He gets higher and higher, and a crowd gathers to marvel at this new healthy gorilla. 

Higher and higher he goes to the thrill of the crowd, until SNAP! The rope breaks and the young man gets launched right into the lion's enclosure. 

Hurt and terrified he starts to shout ""Help! Help!""

""Shut up you idiot,"" the lion says, ""you'll get us all fired"".

When I got home, my wife seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",Beans for lunch,95

""Good morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to.....""

""Oh, there's no need to explain. I've been expecting you,"" Mrs. Jones cut in.

""You have?"" the photographer asked. ""Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.""

""That's exactly what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start?"" asked a blushing Mrs. Jones.

""You just leave everything to me,"" he replied. ""Usually, I try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.""

""Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for George and me,"" stated Mrs. Jones.

""Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. However, if we try several different positions, and I shoot from five or six angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.""

""I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,"" gasped Mrs. Jones.

""Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I would love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.""

""Don't I know!"" exclaimed Mrs. Jones.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ""This was done on the top of a bus in the downtown area,"" he proudly declared.

""Oh my word!"" Mrs. Jones exclaimed.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well, considering the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with,"" he said, handing Mrs. Jones the photograph.

""She was difficult?"" Mrs. Jones asked.

""Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Central Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing and shoving to get a good look.""

""Four and five deep?"" asked Mrs. Jones, her eyes the size of saucers.

""Yes,"" said the photographer. ""And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. It was very difficult for me to concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.""

""You mean they actually chewed on your, umm, equipment?"" Mrs. Jones asked.

""That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.""

""Tripod?"" asked a very worried Mrs. Jones.

""Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action.""

“Jesus is watching.”

The burglar freaks out. He searches the bottom floor two more times, this time much more thoroughly and still finds nothing. He then goes upstairs and begins to search the rooms up there.  Before he gets to the last room, the bedroom of the old man, he hears the same voice.

“Jesus is watching.”

The burglar looks around again, and then warily steps into the room of the old man, certain there has to be someone in there. He shines his flashlight across the room slowly until the light lands on a medium sized bird cage. Inside the cage is a colorful parrot.

“Jesus is watching.”

The burglar chuckles to himself. All this time he was scared of nothing but a bird. Playfully he says:

“Hello there. Are you talking to me?”

The bird quickly squawks back:

“Yes, I am.”

The burglar, more relaxed, decides to mess around more:

“What’s your name?”

“Ishmael.”

The burglar laughs.

Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. 
The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. 
The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?
''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.
''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''

The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.
When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' 
The cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.'' 
The businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went. Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each of the other drivers.",*NSFW* A successful business man flew to Las Vegas for the weekend to gamble.,13

A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""",[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,3

Simply dropping into the local mall for a bit of shopping turned out to be quite an experience:

Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. Here's how the scam works:

Two seriously good-looking voluptuous 20-21 year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping bags into the trunk. They both start cleaning your windscreen; their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. When you thank them and offer them a tip; they'll say No and instead ask you for a lift to another supermarket, in my case K-Mart. You agree and they both get in the back seat. On the way, they  start undressing until both are completely naked.

Then, when you pull over to remonstrate, one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over your lap, kissing you, touching you intimately and thrusting herself against you while the other one steals your wallet!

I had my wallet stolen on October 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th and 29th. Again it happened in November on the 1st, 4th, 6th, 10th and 13th and twice yesterday.

So please warn all the older men you know to be on the lookout for this scam. The best times seem to be just before lunch and about 4:30 in the afternoon.

P.S. K Mart has cheap wallets on sale for $1.99 each but Target wallets are $1.75 and look better.",New Scam - Long but worth the read.,28

The Indians say yes if they successfully do their challenge, so the Europeans agreed. The challenge was to go look for a fruit for and shove it up your ass without laughing, and you only had 10 minutes to find the fruit. So the Europeans went out and searched, once they came back, they were all told to sit around the campfire as everyone shoved fruit up their asses. The first guy brought a peach, he laughed and was put in the cage for later. The second guy brought a grape, he laughed and was also put into the cage. Later that night before the killing commenced, the 2 Europeans had a conversation. “I laughed because the peach was fuzzy” said European 1, he then asked why European 2 laughed if he only had a grape. “I didn’t laugh because of the grape, I laughed because James was hiding a pineapple.”",A group of European explorers were walking through the jungle,2

Lucky for him, there was one room free, and he grabs his bag, hikes up the stairs to his room, and goes in. The storm only gets worse, and 2 male Navy SEALS come into the inn, and ask for a room. The person at the desk informs them that the last room was taken by another soldier, and that there was no more space. The SEALs ask if they can as if they can room with the soldier, because they're all military, and are used to sharing extremely cramped quarters. The person at the desks calls the room of the soldier, and he lets the two SEALs join him for the night. Lightning and thunder crackle, and the rain pounds harder and harder on the roof of this inn. Next, three male Air Force pilots walk in, soaked from the rain. They talk with the person at the desk, and ask if there is any room left in the inn. She informs them that there isn't, but there is some other military personnel in a room, and she can call them and ask if the Air Force pilots can stay with them. The SEALs and the soldier agree, and the Air Force pilots trek up the stairs with their gear to the room. The storm, despite all odds, still gets worse, and the inn is in danger of losing power. Three National Guards, male, walk into the inn. The lady at the desk informs them that there is no more room in the inn, but if they don't mind cramped quarters, she could call the room full of personnel and ask if they had room for 3 more. They implore her to do so, and she is sure that they will say no, but they allow the National Guard people to stay with them. They grab their bags, hike up the stairs, and join the other armed personnel in the room. The storm is showing no sign of abating, and a drenched Marine, female, enters the inn. She pleads with the woman at the desk, asking her if she has even a free janitorial closet that the Marine could crash in. The attendant informs her that there is nothing free, but there was a room full of other armed personnel that she could ask. They accept the Marine, who grabs her kit and walks to the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's morning now and the storm has abated. Slowly but surely, the soldiers start filing out of the room to the breakfast area. The first one down is the soldier. He orders a coffee, black, and sits in the corner, eyes dark with exhaustion, and stares off into the distance. The attendant wonders what happened in that room, but is too awkward to ask. Next, the 2 SEALs trek down to the breakfast area. They order two black coffees, and stare into the windows, not saying a word. The attendant is dying with curiosity, but still hasn't worked up the courage to ask them what happened. The 3 Air Force pilots come down, looking like they're dead on their feet. They also order 3 black coffees, and stare into the distance, occasionally drifting off but snapping back to attention. The attendant wants to ask what happened in that room, but doesn't want to ask. The three National Guardsmen come down the stairs, and look like they got no sleep during the night. They order 3 black coffees, and sit at opposite ends of the room from the other servicemen. The woman who worked the desk in the night doesn't want to intrude, but needs to know that happened in the night. Just as she's about to ask, the Marine comes down the stairs, and orders a cup of tea. The attendant gives up, and goes about her morning routine.

An hour later they go at it full power again disturbing the whole building and the old man slowly walks up to their place and asks them one more time to keep it down. The boys reply ‘sorry old man today practice tomorrow concert’ but they decide it was enough for the day.

After the concert was finished and they go to the apartment to pick up their stuff, one of the boys says ‘hey lets make some noise just to fuck with that old man’. So they agree and start making noise and banging their drums. They do this for two hours and they notice the old man wasn’t coming up to stop them so they get worried. Maybe he died or something. So they get down they find his door open and just decide to walk in only to find the old man in his living room masturbating. The boys, laughing, ask him what is he doing. The grandpa says ‘today practice tomorrow I fuck all your mothers’.

“This is incredible,’ said the man. “Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Final and not use it?”

The neighbour says, “Well actually the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first World Cup Final we haven’t been to together since we got married.”

“Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. That’s terrible… But couldn’t you find someone else, a friend, relative or even a neighbour to take her seat?”

They have this tradition of meeting up at a certain coffee shop and talking about this and that while they eat their collective favorite desert; cherry pie. 

One day, as the friends are enjoying their cherry pie, the topic of who’s religion is true comes up and a long and tiresome discussion ensues. But by the end of it, no conclusion is reached between the Jew, Muslim or Christian. The only thing they can all agree on is that their God (for it is true that they all worship the same god) has many, many rules for man to follow and although these rules can at times seem arbitrary or even unfounded, it is not the duty of man to understand the purpose for any law of God, but rather it is the duty of man to follow the laws regardless of his understanding of them. 

The Christian says, ‘I believe Lust is the most vile, disgusting sin of all and surely God must hate it as much as I do, and for that reason I vow to never as long as I should live act on my sexual urges. I shall remain celibate my entire life to show my commitment to God.’ 

And the Jew says, ‘Well that may very well be true, but it is my opinion that the grossest assault on God’s honor is to work on the sabbath day, for not even did He work on that holiest of holy days, so who would I be as a humble human being to work on His day of rest? For that reason I vow to always keep the sabbath day holy as long as I should live.’

And the Muslim says, ‘Both of you make fair points, but it is my assessment that the pig is the most foul creature to walk the earth, for the spirit of Lucifer himself inhabited that dirty animal and anyone that would consume the flesh and blood of that beast should surely become as perverted and vile as the dark prince himself. For that reason I vow to never eat pork as long as I should live and this is how I will demonstrate my devotion to God.’

With the three friends satisfied with their individual commitments to God, the Jew, Muslim and Christian finished their cherry pie and went on to live very pious lives in their own separate ways. They continued to meet up every week at the coffee shop and eat cherry pie and have discussions for many decades until one day, the three old friends are stepping out of the coffee shop, laughing and wiping the cherry pie crumbs from the corners of their mouths when a bus driver loses control of his vehicle and crashes into the three men killing them instantly. 

The Jew, Muslim and Christian find themselves standing at the pearly gates of heaven before Saint Peter who regrettably informs them that they’ll all be going to hell. The men are understandably furious. 

‘This is outrageous!’ Says the Christian. ‘I was so handsome in life, hundreds of women threw themselves at me but I remained committed to my celibacy! I resisted my lustful urges because I thought that’s what God would want!’ Saint Peter just nods his head and shrugs his shoulders. 

The Jew says, ‘Think about all the money I could have made if I had worked on the sabbath day! I’m talkin’ thousands of dollars down the drain! But I kept the sabbath day holy!’ Again Saint Peter just nods and shrugs. 

The Muslim says, ‘Just the smell of bacon sizzling in a pan is enough to get me salivating like a Pavlov dog, but not once in my entire life did I touch a single molecule of pork meat to my tongue! What is the meaning of this?’ 

And Saint Peter says, ‘Look, gentlemen. There’s no denying that you all lived very devoted lives, but unfortunately you all committed the greatest sin of all.’ The three friends look at one another in bewilderment before asking, ‘What sin is that?’ And Saint Peter says, ‘Well the big guy isn’t really a huge fan of cherry pie.’

Over heating of the engine after such a short distance can be caused by problems associated with the radiator. You need to check the oil and water levels in your engine before you start your journey.

post,apaqom,2qh72,jokes,false,1549846888,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/apaqom/two_horses_are_best_friends/,self.jokes,,"Two horses, one name of Joe and the other Phil, grow up on the same farm together. They’re the best of friends, Joe and Phil, and they both share the dream of one day becoming world class racehorses. Every week they sneak up to the farmer’s window and watch the races, fantasizing about being like those racehorses one day. 

One day the farmer has to sell the two horses and unfortunately has to sell them separately. Joe and Phil are quite torn up about it but they make an effort to maintain their friendship in spite of the distance that now separates them. They call each other every weekend to catch up and of course to talk about the races. 

But as so very often happens when friends are apart for so long, Joe and Phil drift farther and farther apart. They call each other less frequently until eventually they stop altogether. Each horse gets so caught up in their own lives that they practically forget about their childhood friendship. 

Joe ends up taking a simple job pulling a plow. It’s not too terribly difficult of a job and it earns him a fair amount of oats. And despite losing touch with Phil, he still manages to watch the races every week. One day, as he’s sorting his oats and watching the biggest horse race of the year, he notices a familiar face on the screen. It’s his childhood friend, Phil and he’s pulling to the front of the other racehorses!

Joe can’t believe his eyes as Phil wins the race, securing his place in racehorse history. ‘I have to reach out to him!’ Joe says to himself. He spends all night calling every racehorse agency in the country but nobody’s heard of his friend. Finally, the last place he calls just so happens to be the agency that represents Phil. 

‘I know him personally!’ Joe tells the agent. ‘You have to schedule a meeting!’
‘Bullshit,’ says the agent. ‘You just want to cash in on our overnight success story. How do I know you actually are an old friend of Phil’s?’  Joe thinks for a moment and then tells the agent, 
‘Phil has a birthmark that looks like the state of Nevada on his left hind leg. It’s too small to see on tv so you know I must have seen it in person.’
‘That’s true!’ Exclaims the agent. ‘You must be who you say you are, I’ll give you his personal phone number and you can call him yourself.’

After obtaining his friend’s personal cell number, Joe realizes that he is actually quite nervous about reaching out to his old friend. He thinks to himself, What if Phil thinks I’m just hitting him up because he’s famous? He dials the number and hangs up about seven times before he finally decides that it’ll be best to sleep on things and call him in the morning. 

So the morning comes and Joe calls Phil. It seems like an eternity goes by before the familiar voice comes over the line. 
‘Hello?’

‘Hey, Phil. It’s me, Joe. You probably don’t remember me..’

‘Of course I remember you! How’ve you been?’

‘Oh I’ve just been pulling a plow, nothing special. But you, you did it! You did what we always talked about!’

‘Yeah, man. It’s a long story but I’m gonna be in your neck of the woods next week. Maybe we can get a beer and I’ll tell you all about it.’

‘I would like that very much.’

The next week the two old friends meet up at the bar and share a few laughs about the good old days. 
‘Well tell me how you made the dream come true, man. You’re a world class racehorse now.’
Phil takes a long drink before beginning his story.
‘Well,’ he says. ‘Shortly after we got separated, I took this job at the dog track. I figured it wasn’t horses but at least it was racing and maybe I could learn about the industry. I was just cleaning up dog shit off the track and carting around water for the racers. There was this one dog, a grey hound, who was faster than any of the other dogs by such a wide margin that he won every race he ran. His name was Greg. Now one day I was just minding my business, cleaning up some dog shit when Greg walks right past me. I can’t help myself but call out to him. I tell him he’s the fastest dog I’ve ever seen and that I’m interested in racing one day. Well Greg comes up to me and tells me if I’m serious about being a race horse, he can take me under his wing and make me the fastest horse alive. So every winter, Greg would take me up to some property of his in the mountains and make me sprint in the snow. Finally one day he told me I was fast enough to get on the docket. So I marched down to the race track and told the manager, Hey I know I’m new but I’m young and hungry and goshdamn I’m fast. But the manager just laughed at my face and told me I was crazy to think some noname could waltz onto the track mid season and get a spot on the docket. So I went back to Greg with my tail between my legs and told him what happened. Greg just looked at me and said my speed wasn’t something I could just tell them about, I had to show them. So I marched back to the track, they tried to stop me but I leapt over the fence and ran around the track three times in under a minute. The manager couldn’t believe his eyes, I was the fastest damn horse he’d ever seen, and just like that I was signed.’ 

The horses both sipped their beers silently after Phil finished his story until Joe finally shook his head and said, ‘You know, Phil. That story doesn’t make any fuckin sense. Dogs can’t talk.’",Two horses are best friends,36

Hey, 

I saw your ad looking for work and I think I have a job for you! I am looking for an assistant on my farm for the summer. It will involve working outdoors. Let me know if you are interested. 

Mike

From Stephanie ******* to Me
Hi Mike! I am interested in your job! I love animals and used to ride horses so a farm would be great! what kind of work would I be doing, and where is your farm located? it needs to be close to ******** so my parents can drop me off and pick meup

From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie,

It is very close to **********. I'm glad to hear you are familiar with horses, because you will be primarily working with horses.

My farm gets all the old horses that other farms don't need anymore, and they are starting to take up a lot of room in my stable, which I want to turn into a garage for my new truck. Therefore, the horses need to go. As my assistant, you will be in charge of killing the horses and dumping them in the lake behind my farm. 

I used to have a captive bolt pistol (cattle gun) that I used to put them down, but it broke when I tried to use it to tap a keg. You'll probably have to use my 12-gauge shotgun to put them down. Sometimes they don't die right away when you shoot them, and will start freaking out. You just have to stay calm and keep shooting. Don't worry, I'll show you how to use the shotgun if you aren't familiar with one.

You then need to use my chainsaw to cut the horses into smaller parts that you can carry down to the lake. It can get a little messy, so I suggest wearing some clothes that you don't care about, or some clothes that the horse blood would compliment. 

The lake isn't mine, it is my neighbor's. He gets kind of angry when he sees me dumping dead horses in his lake, so you have to make sure he isn't around when you do it. I have some cinderblocks you can use to weigh the horses down so he won't see them. 

I have a lot of horses, and each horse takes about an hour and a half to dispose of, so you should have plenty of work. The job will pay $15 an hour. When can you start? 

Mike

From Stephanie ******* to Me
omg that is HORRIBLE! That is truely awful and sick!! Why cant you just give the poor horses away? sorry but I am not helping you slaughter horses!!!

From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie,

I'm sorry if you are a bit surprised, but this is how farms work. You can't give away old horses, you have to kill them. I thought about it, and if you don't want to use the chainsaw to cut up the horses, you can just use my truck to drag them down to the lake. Do you have your license or permit? If not, this could be good driving practice for you. You don't want to pass up on this great job opportunity.

Mike

From Stephanie ******* to Me
No that is not how farms work you are just SICK! I am NOT interested

From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie you are going to regret this some day when you try to get a real job. I think this would look great on your resume.",Horse Farm,0

His buddies encouraged him and said it was a great idea as having a female around would liven up the mood. Bob, the man with the girlfriend was the only one in his group of friends who had a beautiful girlfriend. Fred's girlfriend--he was the only other man in the group who had a girlfriend--was undoubtedly one of the ugliest people on the planet.

So Bob, Fred, and the rest of the crew hopped in the truck and left the Tavern for Mirabelle's home, for that was her name. She lived with her dad across town and it would be about a 20 minute drive. The guys were afraid of Mira's father. He had a reputation for having a short fuse and many townspeople embellished stories they'd heard about his past. One man even claimed that he was a serial killer who stuffed his victims in a tool shed a couple of acres away from his home in the woods. The guys were under the assumption that each of them would have a turn with Mirabelle, and Bob was totally cool with it, so they hyped each other up and swore to have each other's backs if Mira's dad got involved. 

When they were about halfway there, Bob was feeling extremely drunk and had to pull over. The guys asked ""what's the matter?"" and Bob puked all over James' pant leg. ""AUGHH...gross dude!"" exclaimed James. They decided to let Fred drive since he was arguably the least drunk and most put-together. James took off his pants and threw them out the window and Bob climbed into the back.

A few minutes later, the night had grown completely dark and Fred had a problem with his vision so he abruptly pressed on the break. ""What's the matter?"" asked the guys. Fred said he swore he saw a man in front of the truck so he stopped. Ben chimed in and said that Fred was probably going insane without his medication so he offered to drive the car despite the fact that he'd never driven before. The guys agreed and Ben took the wheel. 

Several minutes pass and Ben is surprisingly decent at handling a car despite his utter lack of experience and how intoxicated he is. Suddenly, out of no where a bird flies smack-dab into the windshield of the truck and this forces Ben to slam his breaks. ""What's the matter?"" asked James. The others in the car turned to James and said ""What are you stupid? Did you not just see that? A bird done flew into the truck."" James nodded and said ""Yeah but why did you stop?"" At this point, Chad spoke up ""It probably scared the living bejesus out of Ben. I love him to death but that boy lacks courage."" So Chad, feeling all mighty and brave promised that he would drive them the rest of the way to Mira's house. 

Chad took the wheel and despite his courage, he couldn't make it all the way. The next guy took over, then the next guy and the next guy and the next guy. Finally, they arrived at Mira's house and found a deer cadaver. It smelled bad.",I met a man in the woods...,0

About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. 

The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. 

Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, “Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.”

Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, “No sir, this can’t be Joe.”

The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.

The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, “No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.”

The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, “Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?”

Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, “Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.”

In shock, the coroner asked, “How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?”

Buddy replied, “No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’”

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam...",89

One day he looks out across the Savannah and sees an elephant bellowing like crazy and rearing up on its hind legs. The man looks through his binoculars and sees that there’s something wrong with the elephant’s foot. He gets closer and looks again. This time he sees that there is a large thorn stuck in the bottom of the elephant’s foot. The man thinks to himself, Gee that sure is a dangerous animal! He could easily crush me if I get too close! But he’s suffering and I can’t just sit idly by..

So the man creeps up to the elephant and waits for him to bellow and rear up on his hind legs and as soon as he does the man runs up, grabs the thorn and yanks it out. The elephant calms down immediately and sets his front legs down with a soft thud. The elephant looks at the man who looks up at the elephant. And very slowly, the elephant reaches down with his trunk, scoops up the man and places him on his back. 

Immediately the man and the elephant are friends and for the duration of the man’s visit he spends all day every day with his new pachyderm pal, riding around on him and taking pictures and what not. And on the last day the elephant can sense that the man is sad. They both know they’ll probably never see each other again. The man holds the end of the elephant’s trunk in his hand and wishes him farewell with tears in his eyes. And there’s tears in the elephant’s eyes as well. 

So the man returns home and life goes on. Years go by and eventually the man marries and has children. One day the man takes his youngest little girl to the zoo. They’re enjoying themselves and walking around looking at all the exhibits. They pass by the elephant enclosure and the man does a double take because one solitary, older elephant has come up to the fence and is staring right at him. The man stares back in disbelief thinking to himself, Can that really be the same elephant I helped over a decade ago? 

The man is doubtful but sure enough the elephant places his trunk against the fence and chortles excitedly. The man takes a step toward the enclosure. The man’s little daughter tugs on her father’s coat and says, ‘Where are you going, daddy?’ The man looks down at his daughter with tears in his eyes and says, ‘I’ll be right back, sweetheart. Daddy’s going to see an old friend.’ 

The man steps up to the fence and smiles up at the elephant who seems to nod back in welcoming. The man touches his hand to the elephant’s trunk from the other side of the fence and looks back at his daughter watching in awe. The man turns back to the elephant and begins to climb the fence. He climbs back down the other side and walks up to the elephant. The man pats the old elephant and says, ‘It’s good to see you, old friend.’ And the elephant reaches down slowly with his trunk, scoops up the man and bashes him to death against the fence because it was the wrong elephant.",A man is on a safari,4

""Yes. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that.""

Upon returning to Washington, he decides he'd better put the US envoy to Venezuela to the test. He summons Elliott Abrams to the White House and says, ""Mr. Abrams, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.""

""Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?""

""Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Abrams hems and haws and finally asks, ""Can I think about it and get back to you?"" Trump agrees, and Abrams leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other envoys, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Abrams calls up Nikki Haley and asks her the question.

""Now look here, Nikki--your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?"" ""It's me, of course, you dumb ass,"" answers Haley.

Much relieved, Abrams rushes back to the White House and exclaims, ""I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Nikki Haley!"" And Trump replies in disgust, ""Wrong, you dumb ass, it's Teresa May!""","While visiting England, Trump is invited to tea with the Queen. He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they're intelligent.",53

So naturally it’s very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; a tortoise who’s had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop a system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. 

Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, ‘do you want me to take you to the pond?’ The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can’t take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, ‘You like her, don’t you?’ The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, ‘You want me to go talk to her for you?’ The frog blinks twice for No. ‘I see,’ says the tortoise. ‘You wish you could talk to her yourself.’ The frog blinks once, a single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. ‘Well gee, my friend,’ says the tortoise. ‘We’ve been good friends for so long, I think I owe it to you to find a way to restore your voice.’ And with that the tortoise sets out.

The tortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets a snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists.  The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there’s anything the snake can do for the frog.
‘Yessssss,’ the snake replies. ‘There issss one sssurgery I can perform that may ressstore your friend’sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it’s very risssky. There’sss a fifty percent chance your friend won’t sssurvive the sssurgery.’ 
‘Oh my,’ says the tortoise. ‘I’ll be sure to let him know!’ 

So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. ‘There’s this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it’s a coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?’ After a long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So a day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just a few short moments they’re either going to hear their friend’s voice for the first time, or they’re going to lose him forever. And you’ll never guess what happened next. 

He croaked! ",A frog is born mute,214

The Farmer takes a closer look at one of the cows and asks to try some of the milk. He grabs a bucket and a stool and sits down. He pulls on the cow's teat and *Ppprrrttt* the cow let's out a fart. 

Startled at first, the Farmer keeps pulling until he has enough in the bucket to taste, but with each tug *Ppprrrttt* another fart comes out.

Thrown off by this cow's strange reaction, the Farmer asks to see a different cow. Again he sits down to milk the cow, and when he pulled the cow's teat, *Ppprrrttt* this cow farted the same. 

Thinking there can't be anything wrong with a cow that farts every time you pull her teat, he decides to buy the first cow he milked.

The Farmer returned home to Minnesota, and settled the new cow into her barn. Every morning he would go down to milk her, and every time he pulled her teat *Ppprrrttt* she would fart.

Later that week, the farmer's friend from the next town over came to visit. The Farmer showed him the new cow, and it's strange habit. He went to milk the cow, and just as always, every tug on her teat would cause *Ppprrrttt* another fart.

The farmer's friend commented: ""Oh you must have gotten that cow from North Dakota""

Baffled, the Farmer asked: ""How could you possibly know that?!""

""I have something in my pocket that I will show you. If you swear you've never seen anything like it before, I'll have free drinks all night""

The barkeeper, in his mid fifties, who has clearly seen a lot in his life, agrees with a nod.

The bald guest grabs into his pocket what appears to be a doll and puts this small person dressed in Victorian clothes onto the bar. The little guy is not taller than a Whiskey bottle, when he suddenly approaches the barkeeper, bows in front of him and says, ""Hello, my name is Rick and I am a British poem writer""

The barkeeper stares baffled at this tiny person for a moment and looks up to the bald guy and says, ""I've never ever seen anything like it! Where did you get him?""

""You know"", the bald man starts ""I've just come from the street corner three blocks further. I had drunk already a lot, so I felt awful and had to lean onto a lantern post not to fall onto my nose. Just by leaning there the rub was sufficient to awaken a fairy who granted me a wish...""

The barkeeper - who already had heard enough - just rushed out of the bar to rub every post he encountered until three blocks further a fairy effectively appeared. With a soft voice she whispered, ""I may grant you a wish, whatever it is!""

The barkeeper, still not believing his luck and the reality of it, responded in a haste ""5 millions in cash!""

The fairy snipped her fingers and disappeared. All that was left was a barkeeper with 5 melons and a rash. Disappointed he went back to his bar, scratching his face, confronting the visitor and his little pal, who still were enjoying free drinks.

""You could have told me that the fairy is hard of hearing!"" screams the barkeeper.

The bald guest looks the barkeeper dead in the eye and says, ""Is that so? BECAUSE YOU REALLY BELIEVE I WISHED FOR A 10 INCH RICK?""

**PLATO**: For the greater good.  


**ARISTOTLE**: It is in the nature of chickens to cross roads.  


**SOCRATES**: Why do you think the chicken crossed the road?  


**HIPPOCRATES**: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.  


**KARL MARX**: It was a historical inevitability.  


**MILES DAVIS**: That chicken was a motherfucker.  


**EINSTEIN**: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.  


**BUDDHA**: Asking this question denies you, your own chicken nature.  


**RALPH WALDO EMERSON**: The chicken did not cross the road. It  
transcended it.  


**CHARLES DICKENS**: It was a far, far better road that he crossed than he had ever crossed before...   


**WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE**: But soft, what bird on yonder asphalt trots?  


**DARWIN**:  Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross roads.  


**DARWIN'S NEPHEW**: Which came first, the chicken or the road?   


**BILL GATES**:  I have just released the new Chicken Office 2020,  which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.  


**OLIVER STONE**: The question is not,  ""Why did the chicken cross the  road?"" Rather, it is, ""Who was crossing  the road at the same time, whom  we overlooked in our haste to observe  the chicken crossing?""  


**FREUD**: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. You see, to you, the road represents the barrier between what is and what might be.  What is…is you in front of the  computer screen, practicing celibacy,  peering into your mother's womb,  wishing to be suckled at her breast (in  this case, at the teats of  internet knowledge and passive acceptance),  hating the reflection in  the screen that reminds you of your father,  thinking how you life can  never measure up… What might be, only the chicken knows, now that he has crossed...  


**MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR**.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.  


**BILL CLINTON**: I feel that chicken's pain as he struggles to make the decision whether or not to cross the road...   
\[**MONICA LEWINSKY**: The chicken's pain isn't the only thing he felt.\]  
**BILL CLINTON'S REPLY**: That depends on how you define ""chicken.""  


**DAVID COPPERFIELD**: I made the chicken disappear and reappear on the other side.  


**ACCENTURE CONSULTING**:  Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. Accenture Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the   Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Accenture helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital, and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Accenture Consulting   convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens   along with Accenture's consultants with deep skills in the  transportation  industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in  order to  leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and  explicit, and  to enable them to synergize with each other in order to  achieve the  implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecture  and  implement an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum  of  poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent,   clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution. Accenture Consulting helped the chicken to become more successful.

The other guy is sceptical about this endavour, but eventually agrees. They go to a bar. After finishing their beer, the guy goes on his knees, opens the other guy's pants and puts the sausage in his mouth. The bartender is furious, screams insults and kicks them out.

After leaving, the one guy asks the other victoriously. ""So, did we pay anything?"". ""No"" the other guy had to admit.

They repeat the procedure: drinking, kneeing, sausage, getting kicked out. Bar after bar, after bar, after bar...

After fifteen bars, the one guy complains. ""Man, I can't go down anymore. My knees hurt so badly!"".
