Less hands started to go up

Only a few hands rose at this point

""What about 50 years?""

Only one couple raised their hands

""Wow, 50 years. You younger couples should take advice from them, true dedication to their relationship to last that long""

After the sermon, a younger couple came up to the older couple and said ""We've only been married for a couple years, and it's been kinda rocky lately, do you have any advice for us on how to stay together?""

The old man looked at his wife and then back at the younger couple. ""Well, we always had relationship problems throughout our marriage, and at one point I told my wife that if we make it to 25 years, I'll take her to Hawaii to celebrate.""

""Wow, that's really special. What did you promise her if you made it to 50 years?"" asked the younger man

And he means EVERYTHING he is not joking. The company goes and install usb sockets for each passenger, a blue tooth operated coffee machine (with proper grinder, not that bullshit with capsules), a GPS tracking got each wheel and the list continues.

Two weeks later the guy picks up his car from the agency and on the first traffic light he sees an old Volkswagen Beetle. The beetle driver rolls down the window laboriously, and signal our hero to do the same. The guy select the ""roll-down-for-converssation-and-impression"" option on the touch interface and window slides down smoothly.

Beetle: Nice car man! Do you have a seround audio system for your DVD?
Mecdes: Do I? Man each passenger has his own movie theater and there are sound dampers between each seat so to not interfere with each other!
Beetle: Nice! What about AC system for your feet?
Mercedes: pppphhhh AC. I'm speaking here about seat warmers and full body massagers.
Beetle: Uh I like those. and king size bed you have it?
Mercedes: huh?
Beetle: king size bed, you know, for sleeping.
Mercedes: you are pulling my leg, there is no room for it.
Beetle: dude! I have a Volkswagen beetle and I have one installed check it out. 

Mercedes guy looks through the window and indeed there is a king size bed in the beetle. There is even a night stand and a small reading lamp. Our guy is making a U-turn on the spot and rage in the the agency. 
""I asked for EVERYTHING! Where is my king size bed!?""

The agency guys are all fumbled ""king size bed? Sir this is a car. There is no room for it""

""Don't you dare give me that BS! With my own eyes, right out of the agency, I saw a Volkswagen Beetle with one installed! Night stands and all!. A 50 years old lousy car and you are telling me a modern MERCEDES cannot have one?!""

The agency begins to contact it's engineers and turns out that in the early 70 some Johan dude came up with a method to insrall a king size bed in a Mercedes. It requires some twicking what with the complete set of additions to the car. But passing another week, our hero has the car available to him again, now with a king size bed installed. They even added a speaker playing relaxing sounds like birds and waves for better sleeping.

And you guessed it. The same beetle is on the same traffic light. The Mercedes guy is pressing the horn, but the beetles windows do not open. He nonks some more and nothing. Eventually he steps out of his car, and knocking on the beetle window. After half a minute, through which the guy knocked some more the window rolls down, and the beetle driver goes head pops out with a shower hat.

Beetle: ""Oh hey it's you from one week ago. What's the rush?""
Mercedes: ""I just came back from the agency, they installed a king size bed in my car""
Beetle: ""dude, that's very poor reason to pull me out of the shower!""",This guy walks into a Mercedes agency and asks for the top executive model.,3

Her husband had this puzzled look on his face but started smiling and shaking my hands. “thank you sir, THANK YOU!  I appreciate you saving her life and am eternally thankful but I have to ask… what the hell do you call that??”

Well he did exactly that and took a role as a mail boy in a merchant bank.

When WW1 broke he was drafted and fought as a officer in the light horse brigade. At one stage, diving off his horse, he held  his helmet over a grenade, losing several fingers but saving many other lives. He was discharged honorably and awarded a medal for his bravery.

He went back to his job and continued his march up the corporate ladder until WW2 broke.

He actually fooled the enlistment office, whom had fortunately lost his papers and found himself once again unlisted this time as a sergeant. 

He was captured soon after his deployment and spent a year in a Nazi prison camp. He used his time to learn German from the guards and whilst shunned by his fellow inmates for acting friendly towards the enemy used his given privileges to escape, travel across Germany to Switzerland and then to England disguised as a clergy man and rejoined his battalion to fight out the war. Again receiving a DSO for his efforts.

He returned from war, continued his career and spoke little of it, we only know these stories due to a few military records. A great man, a driven man.

You know I can still remember the day he, you know, kicked the bucket. I can still remember the last words he said to me before doing so.

He and I were standing in his backyard. I a very young boy, he a very old man. He took a few steps backwards, stumbled slightly. I put out my hand but a man like this would never accept help, particularly from a child. He composed himself and took a further step back. 

I looked at him, he looked at me, those eyes, such intensity, like I had never seen. He opened his mouth as it to say something which was odd as he barely spoke by this stage. He said, ""watch how hard"". ""grampa?"", I questioned. He continued, "" watch how hard I can kick this bucket"".

Finally, the doctor asked, ""Just exactly what are you trying to find out?""

""We're not trying to find out anything,"" the husband replied. ""She's married and we can't go to her house. I'm married and we can't go to my house. The Holiday Inn charges $90. The Hilton charges $108. We do it here for $50.....and I get $43 back from Medicare.

“Well, I came in around 9 like usual and got myself a drink. Then I turned and noticed this panda sitting at the bar drinking a beer and reading the newspaper, just like now. So I thought what the hell and went over to chat with him. We sat there for ages and really hit it off. He's really quite an interesting chap once you can get him to open up.

Anyway, we talk some more and drink a couple of cocktails before I suggest to him that we should leave the bar and head to the motel around the corner…”

At this point I can't believe my ears. This woman was trying to get a panda to get a room with her!

She goes on, “Mr Panda says ‘sure why not’ and we leave the bar hand in hand and go to the motel. We got some funny looks going into the motel but I didn't really care. So we checked in and headed for the room. The room was shabby and small but there was an en suite bathroom and a large bed. For the price it was a steal.

Anyway Mr. Panda picks me up and throws me onto the bed before climbing on top of me. We were both so excited. I'd never bagged a panda before and he presumably didn't get with women so often.

So anyway we start to undress each other and suddenly he pauses. ‘What's wrong?’ I ask. ‘Ah nothing. But I'm really hungry and need to eat something first. I'll be back in a minute…’ Before I knew it he was up and out of the room. He was only gone about 90 seconds before entering the room again with a mouthful of Snickers; he'd been to the vending machine around the corner.

I was getting impatient though and told him to get his arse back in bed. He did just that. He ran over, dived on me, tearing the rest of my clothes off and ravishing me. It was wonderful. I was in a world of ecstasy like I'd never before known existed. 

He has great stamina and this continues for a solid 2 hours before he can't contain himself anymore. He shoots his load, practically drowning me in Mr. Panda juice. But then immediately he gets out of bed and begins to get dressed, putting on his dungarees before his underwear, obviously in a rush to get somewhere.

‘Where are you going?!’ I said, ‘you can't just up and leave already!’

‘Yes I can,’ he said calmly, ‘I‘m a panda.’ and started towards the door.

‘No, you have to pay first,’ I said, I‘m a prostitute!’

‘I don't know what you're talking about…’ he said.

I then told him to ‘look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what a prostitute is, go on have a look, P-R-O-S-T-I-T-U-T-E, prostitute: person who sells their body for money!’

I was now getting dressed too and he was halfway out of the door when he said ‘Panda, go on look it up, P-A-N-D-A, panda: eats roots shoots and leaves...

",Mr. Panda,2

MOM : “Give me two good reasons why you don’t want to go to school??”
SON : ""One, all the children hate me. 
Two, all the teachers hate me!!”
MOM : “Oh! that’s not a reason darling. Come on, you have to go to school.”
SON : “ OK. You give me two good reasons, WHY I should go to school?”
MOM : One, you are FIFTY-TWO years old, and should understand your responsibilities!
Two You are the 'PRINCIPAL' of the school ""😂",Give me two good reasons,66

Disappointed, Baby Balloon goes back to his own room, gets into his Baby Balloon bed, tries to sleep but cannot. 

All of a sudden, Baby Balloon has an idea. He creeps back into Mummy &amp; Daddy Balloon’s room. Mummy &amp; Daddy Balloon are sleeping so to make room in the bed Baby Balloon lets a little bit of air out of Mummy Balloon, lets a little bit of air out of Daddy Balloon, and lets a little bit of air out of himself. 

It works. Now with room in the bed, Baby Balloon quietly snuggles in between Mummy Balloon and Daddy Balloon and can sleep. 

In the morning Baby Balloon wakes and can see Mummy Balloon and Daddy Balloon are not happy. 

‘Baby Balloon,’ Mummy Balloon says, ‘we’re not impressed by your actions’. 

Daddy Balloon weighs in, ‘Baby Balloon, we want you to really think about what you did last night. We’re very disappointed. You’ve let your Mummy down, you’ve let me down, and most of all you’ve let yourself down’. ",Baby Balloon,4

Every doctor tells him he's done for and the worm will starve him to death, but a friend of his who used to go on mission trips tells him about this doctor that has a technique to get rid of the worm, but warns him that the doctor is quite unusual.

The next day, the guy goes in for an appointment, and after a short interview the doctor says: ""good news, I take care of these worms all the time, it's a 30 day treatment. Everyday you come in for the treatment you'll need to bring: a carrot, a bottle of coke, and a cupcake"" the guy asks the doctor what those are for, but the doctor says not to question him, there is no time to waste.

Right the next day the guy shows up at the office with the carrot, the coke, and the cupcake. The doctor tells him to pull his pants down and bend over the table, and before the guy has time to think about it, the doctor shoves the carrot up the guy's butt, followed quickly by the coke and the cupcake. The guy obviously freaks the fuck out, but the doctor tells him to calm down ""do you want to live or not? Shut the fuck up and let me do this"".

The guy is desperate, so he puts up with the treatment. On the 29th day, after shoving the carrot, the coke, and the cupcake; the doctor tells him: ""we are almost done, tomorrow, bring the carrot, the coke, but instead of a cupcake, bring a hammer"" the guy freaks out once more, but the doctor yells at him again, ""do you wanna live? TRUST ME""

On the 30th and final appointment, the guy shows up with a bag with the carrot, the coke, and the hammer. He pulls down his pants and bends over as always, then the doctor shoves in the carrot, then the coke, and grabs the hammer, after a second or two, the worm pokes his head out of the guy's butt and says ""where's the cupcake?"" and BAM! the doctor gets him with the hammer.

The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game? The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. 

The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa. "" Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. 

The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."" This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. 

The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. ""Okay"" says the lawyer, ""your turn."" She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. 

Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00. 

The blonde says, ""Thank you,"" and turns back to get some more sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?""

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

When she entered the barn, the brothers woke up and took advantage of the beautiful girl. She, afterward, ran away crying to her father.

The two brothers were brought before the king by his Royal Guard. The king said, ""I know what you did and despite your contributions, you will be punished.""

""The first part of your punishment is to go out in your farmlands and pick 100 of your favorite fruit. Bring those fruits back to me quickly for your lives depend on it.""

The first brother runs quickly to the vineyard and begins gathering grapes. He knows they are in season and he can gather 100 in short order. He brings his basket of grapes to the king.

The king says, ""Excellent work. Now you must put all 100 of these grapes up your ass. I probably don't need to mention that your life depends on it.""

The brother sees the king is serious and eyes the guards' sharp spears and begins his task. Things seem to be going well.

It happened back in the late 90s. Arthur had been at Tesco, the local supermarket, and had just finished getting his weekly groceries. Back then it was very common that you needed a pound coin to unlock the shopping cart. And Arthur was in the midst of returning his shopping cart in exchange for his original pound coin, when he was approached by 3 young boys. The boys wanted Arthur's pound coin, and they'd threatened him. ""Geez yer quid, or we'll chib ye"", the local dialect which translates to, ""Give us your pound, of we'll stab you"". 

Arthur took personal offense. He had always claimed he never knew what came over him. But Arthur attacked the boys, and brutally strangled all 3 of them to death. 

The local news had never seen a story like it in such a small town. And the following day, they published their story: 'Arty-Chokes 3 for a pound at Tesco'

On a branch in the tree next to the pond was a bird watching the frog below. The bird thought to itself, “If only that buzzing fly were a little lower that frog would jump out over the pond and I’ll sweep down to snatch that frog and eat it for my lunch.”

The bird was unaware of a cat on a higher branch in that tree next to the pond. The cat was watching what was transpiring below and thought to itself, “If only that buzzing fly were a little lower that frog would jump up to catch it and as soon as that bird takes off to catch the frog I’ll jump off this branch to catch it in mid flight to eat it for my lunch.”

A moment later the buzzing fly flew a little lower and the frog leapt up to catch it. The bird swooped down to catch the frog. The cat pounced after the bird, jumping out over the pond...and missed.

When he gets there, a general walks up to him. He tells the scientist that the prototype animal is in the other room. He can study it, take notes, whatever he wants, as long as he does not touch the animal. 

He goes to the other room and sees a hulking gorilla standing stock-still in a cage. The gorilla doesn’t even blink. He spends the rest of the afternoon studying it, and it never moves. After everybody else leaves, the general says that the man can stay as long as he wants, provided he does not touch the gorilla. 

The scientist stays and studies more, until he finally gets curious and goes up to the gorilla and ever so slightly brushes it on the shoulder. The gorilla does nothing, so the man assumes it’s ok. As he packs up to leave, he hears the cage bars being wrenched apart and the gorilla roar. 

The man starts to run and the gorilla chases him. He runs down many flights of stairs until he gets to floor 52, which is an office complex. He runs to the corner of the room and hides under the farthest desk. 

A few seconds later, the gorilla comes into the room and starts destroying everything, until the last thing intact is the desk where the scientist is hiding. The gorilla walks up the the desk, lifts it up and moves it, and stares at the scientist’s cowering figure for a second before lightly tapping the scientist on the chest and saying, “Tag, you’re it.”

The first bum says to the other two, ""I think I'm going to go over there and get me some action."". He walks across the road and comes back a few minutes later with a smile on his face.

The other two bums curious of his endeavors ask him what happened to him. He replies to them, ""Well my lovely lady put a pineapple ring around my pecker, and she ate it off!"".

The other two bums got excited and so with delight, the second bum said he'd try his luck as well. He left them and headed towards the whorehouse.

A few minutes later he comes back to them with a big smile on his face and the other two bums question his endeavors. The second bum told them, ""My lovely lady put two pineapple rings around my pecker and she ate them off!""

The third bum unable to stand being left out raced across the road to the whorehouse, and after several minutes walked out with the biggest smile on his face of them all.

post,8p17gr,2qh72,jokes,false,1528296519,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8p17gr/my_two_girlfriends/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.
Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?""
And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.
So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""
""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""
So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""
So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""
So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.
A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""
So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.
So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.
So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.""
I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow
So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.""
""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""
""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""
""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""
""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""
""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""
I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.
So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.
Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.
Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.
And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",My two girlfriends,10

""So Joe, what did you do?"" asks his mother. Joe replies ""I went out to the ice cream parlor and bought myself an ice cream."" ""Oh, that's nice"", says his mother. ""What flavor did you get?"" Joe says ""Strawberry."" Joe's mother explodes, ""Strawberry?!? Why, you little liar! Just wait until your father gets home!""

A few hours later, Joe's father comes home. The mother says ""You would not believe what Joe told me. He needs to be punished."" Joe's father says ""OK, calm down. Joe, what happened?""

Joe says ""Mom gave me my allowance, so I went out to the ice cream parlor and bought myself an ice cream. Then I came home, and mom asked me what flavor of ice cream I got. I told her, and she got really mad!""

Dad says ""Really? That's pretty unreasonable. Joe, you didn't do anything wrong. You are not in trouble. By the way, what flavor did you get?"" ""Strawberry."" ""You little son of a bitch! How dare you lie to me? I'm so mad, I'm calling the cops!""

A few minutes later, the cops arrive. ""OK, son, tell us your side of the story.""

Joe says ""Mom gave me my allowance, so I went out to the ice cream parlor and bought myself an ice cream. Then I came home, and mom asked me what flavor of ice cream I got. I told her, and she got really mad! So when dad got home, I told him what happened, and he got so mad that he called you! Are you going to arrest me?""

The cops glared at Joe's parents. ""Sir, 911 is for serious emergencies only. We don't have time to investigate petty complaints like these. Please do not waste out time like this. Another call like this and we'll have to write you a ticket.""

""So I'm not in trouble?"" asks Joe.

""No, son, you're not in trouble. By the way, what flavor ice cream did you get?""

""Strawberry.""

""On the ground, NOW! Hands behind your head! Move it, scumbag!"" The cops procede to taser the shit out of Joe.

Months later, Joe is in court. The judge asks ""What is this case about?"" The defense attorney begins ""Your honor, my client is completely innocent. He got his allowance from his mother, proceded to the ice cream parlor, had ice cream, and returned home. Any reasonable person would conclude that this is a perfectly reasonable course of action for any young man. And yet, he was arrested, beaten, and tased by the arresting officers. We ask that all charges be dropped. Furthermore, we ask that charges be brought against the arresting officers.""

The judge asks the prosecution for his opening statement. ""Your honor, the prosecution has no case. We request that the case be dismissed.""

The judge addresses Joe. ""Son, the state apologizes for any inconvenience that this misunderstanding has caused. You are free to go.""

Joe smiles, gets up, and turns to leave the courthouse. The judge says ""You're a good boy. I like ice cream too. By the way, what flavor did you get."" Joe mumbles ""Strawberry."" ""Boy, I could have you hanged for that! But rope is too good for you. I never, ever, want to see you again. You are to leave town, and never return. You disgust me. If you ever step foot in this town again, I will personally see to it that you get the death penalty.""

Completely dejected, Joe leaves the courthouse. As he is crossing the street, he gets run over by a reckless driver and killed.

The moral of the story?

Look both ways before you cross the street.",A little boy gets his weekly allowance.,0

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",636

Suck my cock then.” Jessica was shocked by what her father said. “ Are you serious!?!” said Jessica. Her dad responded “If you want to go to the party, you’re going to suck my cock.” Jessica reluctantly pulled her father’s pants and underwear down revealing his cock.

Next day he comes to pick up his car, get inside and starts pulling out. To his surprise, after service his Lada feels like a totally different car - it goes very smoothly and very quietly. The only problem is that it can't go very fast. Nevertheless, he is happy and comes back to service centre to thank them. ""It's amazing, how did you do it? And by the way, can I go a little faster?"", he asks. ""No, you can't go faster. We installed a power window motor, what else did you expect for $100?""",A Lada owner comes to Mercedes service,4

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a dingy slum,3

""Become white. Just 99 cents!!""

They shrug it off and continue driving. Soon, they pass another billboard that reads:

""You can be white, too, for just 99 cents! Make the change!""

Leon says, ""What the fuck? There's another one!""

Ray Ray says, ""That's fucked up, man.""

They continue driving. They then pass a third billboard, which reads:

""Become white now and get all the white privilege! Only 99 cents. Next exit!""

Leon says, ""You know what man, being black in the US sucks. But being black in the South really sucks. Let's try it out?""

Ray Ray says, ""You're right. I'm broke, unemployed, discriminated against all the time. Sick of this shit. I wouldn't mind some white privilege. Especially if it only costs 99 cents. Let's do it.""

So Leon and Ray Ray get off at the next exit and find the white conversion facility. 

Ray Ray empties his pockets to gather what little money he has. 

""I've only got 98 cents"", says Ray Ray. 

""It's ok. I've got 1 dollar. I'll go in first, make the change, and then I'll have 1 cent as change. So I'll give you the change, which will give you 99 cents, and you can go in after me"", says Leon. 

""Ok, ok. That works. Good luck in there"", says Ray Ray. 

So Leon walks into the facility, visibly nervous. One hour passes. Then two. Then three. Ray Ray is starting to get concerned. 

Suddenly, a tall white guy walks out of the facility. He has milky skin, blond hair, blue eyes, a striking blond beard, and he's wearing a seersucker suit and is holding a very fashionable leather briefcase. 

Another man leans out of the facility and waves goodbye to the man leaving, ""Good luck Leon! We hope you enjoy your new life!""

Excited, Ray Ray runs up to the new Leon and says, ""Hey! Leon! Let me get that change man!""

Leon looks at Ray Ray with contempt and says, ""Get a job, nigger.""

The engaged woman giggled and said, 'That's pretty much my story! When my fiance got home last Friday, he found me waiting for him in a black mask,leather bodice, black hose and stiletto pumps. He was so turned on that we not only made love all night, but he also wants to move up our wedding date!'

Mysteriously, anyone who made the journey to the sorcerer never came back. Of course, the ranger decided to make the journey, to figure out what was going on. He made sure to take an arrow as well. 
 
After many miles, he arrived at the sorcerer’s cave. He ventured in, and was greeted by Danny himself. Danny held out his hand to take the arrow, and thinking nothing of it, the ranger handed it to him. Like a flash of lightning, Danny attempted to stab the ranger. The ranger tried to evade, but is stabbed inches away from his heart. 
 
Wisely, the ranger fled, the arrow still sticking out of him. He was taken care of by the town’s doctor, but he was told to never go on adventures again. So instead, the ranger went to the pub and told everyone his story, the truth behind Danny, and to never go near him again. The ranger is praised and cheered for his bravery. 
 
Fast forward a couple of years, and now the ranger is the bartender. He is old and fat, and he silently watches the young rangers that enter the pub, wishing he could be as young and agile as they are. A young ranger stands out to him, and he sees every quality that he once had in this young ranger. The young ranger asks for a drink. When the old ranger hands it to him, he says: 
 
“I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to Danny.”","Hundreds of years ago, there was a brave ranger who went on many adventures.",11
