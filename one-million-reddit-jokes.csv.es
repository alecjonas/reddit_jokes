He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

The third man, now standing in solitude, decides to go to the fruit punch stand to have some diversity within the group.

After the men get their respective drinks, they sit down on a nearby bench and the first two men start complaining about how long the lines were for each of their stands. 

The first man says, “It took forever to get this stupid cup of lemonade. There were so many damn people waiting I thought I would never get a cup.”

The second man instantly fires back. “Quit being dramatic, did you see the amount of people in my line? It took at least thirty minutes to get my iced tea. I could’ve had gone to war and back and still wouldn’t have been served yet.”

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

She was very famous with the people, because she was very pretty.

She was very nice, and very charming.

She helped the poor, and promised to provide education and mass literacy.

In the upcoming 1989 presidential elections of New Eastington, there was another promising candidate, and that was Rhedon Ditko. 

At a young age, he was influenced by the United States, and he vowed to be a nice democratic candidate.

He was often ironically called ""Red"".

He didn't have the chance to enter politics, so when he got nominated, he was absolutely hyped.

This was it. He would destroy communism in the country once and for all.

That was his lifelong promise, and the candidates pursued their campaigns.

One day, he had a dream of a new slogan. And he put that slogan to good use.

He hired people to put the posters on the streets. And when he did, it became insanely popular.

In the election on November 9th, 1989, many people voted for Rhedon.

Rhianne was shocked. How could this be? Her political campaign had failed.

On that night before the results were announced, she checked it again.

This wasn't a dream. It was all real.

It was all real.

93% of the people voting for Rhedon, with a 86% voter turnout. She was deeply upset.

After the elections, she scheduled a meeting with Rhedon, now the President-elect, set to be inaugurated on November 12th.

She sat down and conversed with him.

&gt;Hello, Rhedon.

&gt;&gt;How are you doing, Rhianne?

&gt;I'm deeply upset. I lost! I was very popular...

&gt;&gt;It's alright. I can teach you to create a better political campaign that will get the popularity of the people!

&gt;Really?

&gt;&gt;Of course.

&gt;What was it that made your campaign so popular?

&gt;&gt;I think it was the slogan. It came to me in a dream. 

&gt;I see. So, what was it?

&gt;&gt;Actually, I still have it propped up on my computer. 

And with that, Rhedon opened his laptop.

He clicked on a file named ""Important stuff"".

After scrolling down some more, he eventually turned the computer around.

On the screen were the words ""I will help educate the poor! Vote for Red!""

&gt;I presume they thought you were communist.

&gt;&gt;I guess you were right.

But in reality, that was not his plan.

He pulled up a newspaper on November 10th, 1989.

The newspaper headline was bold and clear, even though parts of Rhedon's name were still blurred when he spilled coffee on it a few hours ago.

It read, ""R&gt;!h!&lt;ed&gt;!on!&lt; Dit&gt;!ko!&lt; Claims Victory in Election, R&gt;!h!&lt;i P. Austing is Downvoted""",Rhedon Ditko and the Fall of Communism,1

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Burger King and his wife Dairy Queen had a son named Little Cesar. One day comes along Dairy Queen's ex, McDonald (you know, like, old McDonald had a farm, and on his farm he had a Chik-Fil-A, e-i-e-i-oh).

Well, McDonald tells Burger King he thinks it's his kid. Naturally, Burger King doesn't know what to do. So he calls up his friend Wendy.

Wendy tells him to go down to the Church's, that he'll be In &amp; Out. So he goes down to the Church's and asks for the priest.

The priest ain't there. So, the nun Auntie Anne tells Burger King the priest should be out in the Olive Gardens, so he goes there, instead.

OutBack in the Olive Gardens, Burger King finds some crazy old nutty guy named Colonel Sanders. Colonel Sanders says the priest doesn't work Ruby Tuesdays, but... Thank God It's Friday, so the priest is probably on break at the Subway helping the homeless.

So, Burger King goes down to the Subway, finds the priest Father Arby, ringing some stupid Taco-like Bell, and explains the story.

The priest says ""Ah, it's probably a load of Sonic!"". That Burger King should go back to his dumb White Castle, and forget all about McDonald's lies. That everything should be just fine.

So he does, he goes back to his White Castle, and when he gets back, he finds Dairy Queen getting railed over the table by Five Guys! He shouts ""K-F-C!"", stopping the group Chipotle that was happening almost instantly!

Then, Burger King asks why she didn't just call Popeyes, their neighbor, to come on over again. Rather than making a big deal out of it, Burger King pulls out his Long John Silver and finishes Dunkin' the Donuts.

Basically the Domino's effect, right? So, in the end, Burger King found out his wife was a cheating slut, but he got to Krispy Kreme the bitch, so they all lived happily ever after in their own little Pizza Huts.""",George Carlin-styled joke I wrote. Need opinions!,4

They rediscover each other via a reunion website and arrange to meet   for lunch in a wine bar.

Jan arrives first, wearing a beige Versace. She orders a bottle of Pinot Grigio.

Sue arrives shortly afterward, in grey Chanel. After the required ritualized kisses she joins Jan in a glass of wine.

Then Mary walks in, wearing a faded old tee-shirt, blue jeans and boots. She too shares the wine.

Jan explains that after leaving school and graduating from Cambridge in Classics, she met and married Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter. Timothy is a partner in one of London's  leading law firms. They live in a house in Chelsea, where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They have a second home in Italy.

Sue relates that she graduated from St Thomas' and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a leading City investment banker. They live Kensington and have a second home in Florida.

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Jim. They run a tropical bird park in Ilford and grow their own vegetables. 
Jim can stand five parrots, side by side, on his  penis.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a cashier in Asda. They live in a small apartment in Barking and have a caravan at Southend.

Sue, chastened and encouraged by her old friend's honesty, explains that she and Clive are both nurses in a retirement home. 
They live in Tower Hamlets and go on camping trips.

""For your final task, there is an old woman upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to have intercourse with her, and make sure she climaxes.""

The man is stunned, he cannot ever imagine drinking an entire liter of pepper tequilla in a single sitting. But, after a few beers, he has loosened up enough and accepts the challenge.

The bartender goes into the back room and comes out with a liter of pepper tequilla. The man takes it, and with every single ounce of his perseverence and self control, he swallows every drop of the pepper tequilla without making a single face or dropping a single tear. 

Once he finishes, he slams the empty bottle on the ground in victory and stumbles over to the pitbull in the back, closing the door behind him.

Everyone in the bar is listening closely, and they hear the man shouting and yelling, while the pitbull is going absolutely mad growling and barking.

Everything from outside falls silent for a moment, and just when everyone thought he had been killed, the man barges back into the bar, with all of his clothes ripped up and scratches covering him from head to toe.

""NOW,"" he says, ""Where is that old woman with the sore tooth?""",A man walks into a bar and sees a jar of 10 dollar bills sitting on the counter.,267

He was told to be at the office first thing Monday morning. He thought to himself “Well if this is what I think it is, I better lawyer up.”

Sure enough he got a lawyer and was there Monday morning. The guy from the IRS went through the details and asked if the gentleman was aware of the transactions. Here’s the conversation. 
Gentleman: “Yeah I do a little gambling here and there.” 
IRS: “With this big of an amount of money?”
Gentleman: “Sure. Here I’ll make you a bet. I bet you $5,000 that I can bite my own eye.”

With that being said, the guy from the IRS took the bet knowing he couldn’t do it. The gentleman then pulled out his glass eye, and bit it.

Gentleman: “Now don’t worry, I’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. I’ll bet you $10,000 that I can bite my other eye.”

The guy from the IRS saw no seeing eye dog, and saw no stick for the blind, so he knew for sure this was a sure win.

IRS: “You’ve got yourself a deal”

The gentleman then takes his dentures out and bites his other eye.

Gentleman: “Now now don’t be upset. I’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. I’ll bet you $20,000 that from the other side of your desk, I can go to the bathroom and make all of my urine end up in your trash can, not a drop anywhere else.”

The IRS guy knew for sure that he couldn’t do that. So he took this bet knowing he’d made $20,000.

IRS: “You’re on old man! There’s no chance in hell you can do that!”

The gentleman then proceeds to urinate all over the IRS guys desk. As he jumps up and down in joy because he won the bet.

IRS: “You lose! You owe me $20,000!!!”

While celebrating, the IRS guy couldn’t help but notice gentleman’s lawyer, who was sitting there shaking his head in shame.

IRS: “What’s your problem?”

Lawyer: “He bet me $100,000 on the way here that he could piss all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”",The Man and the IRS,90

“Dear Jimmy, I am a riddle,
I’m cute and tiny, very little.

Guess the answer, very quick,
And you get a day off, without faking sick.

Complete me now, for all the joy
You are what your mama has, which is...”

I looked at my friend who shrugged his shoulders... so with anticipation and big eyes, I looked at my teacher. After a couple of seconds I said: 

Ooooh of course! I am what my mommy has! I am a cute little boy!

She turned the page and there it was! The clue, the answer!

“... a cunt.”



But it wasn’t finished there.

“Yes that’s right, you little shit.
A cunt you are, a brat-to-hit.

Thanks to your existence, the question is answered, 
the living proof, that men will get angered.

Multitasking - for women only,
Not because of masturbating while moaning.

But you are here, the proof, that tells.

Because you smell like your mamma gave birth, while pissing herself.”

Likewise, when he saw a woman with the same breast size as his deceased wife, he had to tell her, ""Your breasts might be same size as my late Nelia. Let me make sure."" So, he put his hands on the woman's breasts and they were the same size. ""Yes. Same as Nelia's,"" he nodded. ""Thank you for giving me a second with my late wife's breasts.""

Lady said to me, ""Rejection builds character."" ""Well,"" I said (true story), ""I must have *great* character.""

I once had a kidney-stone, and I named it ""Class,"" for three reasons: 1}. I didn't want it to be anything like me. 2}. I figured it was the only way I would ever pass a class. 3}. I'm the kind of guy that names his kidney-stones. (OK, not really, but I wouldn't put it passed me).

I'm also the kind of guy that doesn't sit by anyone at lunch. I tell myself that it isn't because I have no friends, but because I fear for my safety - my face does vaguely resemble the cafeteria meatballs.

A friend was teasing me about not having a girlfriend, and I said, ""Hey, at least I have *time*, unlike some losers I know. Gotta run - Smash Bros. tournament goes all day tomorrow so I have to get to bed early.""

I once looked in a mirror and was surprised that I didn't see myself. Not because I was a vampire, but because it never occurred to me to open my eyes.

As he was in no particular hurry, he offered to help, and the woman gladly accepted his offer, albeit with some scepticism, for she now saw that there was no way in hell that her new fridge would fit through. 

Immediately, the man whipped out a little plastic biro, and started reciting mantras in what seemed to be several different languages while moving the low-quality writing instrument in a slow circle above his head. 

All of a sudden, there was a bright flash of light, and a beautiful harmonic ringing. When her eyes readjusted, the woman saw that the fridge had, miraculously, seemingly teleported from one side of the door to the other. 

Astounded, she then asked him if he'd also be able to move her rickety old antique bookcase upstairs into her study without breaking it. Feeling charitable, the man obliged, and set to work, taking out his biro, doing his little dance, and reciting his multilingual verses. The same flash of light and harmonic ringing ensued, and, lo and behold, the bookcase was upstairs, with not a scratch to be seen. 

Amazed, the woman asked: ""So, is this a thing that you've been taught, or...?"" 

The man replied: ""Oh, I don't know, I've always had a penchant for this kind of thing""",A guy was walking down a road.,2

One rainy day she was in bed with her boyfriend when, to her horror, she heard her husband's car pull into the driveway.

' I can't jump out the window, it's raining out there!' 

' If my husband catches us in here, he'll kill us both!' she replied, ' he's got a hot temper and a gun, so the rain is the least of your problems!' 

So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window.
As he ran down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovered he had run right into the middle of the town's annual marathon, so he started running along beside the others, about 300 of them.

Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tried to blend in as best he could.

After a little while a small group of runners who had been watching him with some curiosity,  jogged closer.
‘Do you always run in the nude?' one asked . 
' Oh yes!' he replied, gasping in air, ' it feels so wonderfully free!’ 

Another runner moved along side, ' Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?' 
' Oh, yes,' our friend answered breathlessly, ' that way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!' 

Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and asked, ' Do you always wear a condom when you run?'

However, the pilot sees a warning light go on which says it’s leaking fuel, and he informs the passengers that the plane needs to be lighter to make it to the mainland or else it will fall into the ocean and everyone will die.  So the passengers dump out all the luggage and seats, but it’s still too heavy.

Then the British man shouts, “God save the queen!” And he jumps out.

Then the French man shouts, “Viva la France!” And he jumps out.

Then the American shouts, “Let’s make American great again!” And he jumps out. (You were expecting him to throw out a Mexican?)

Then the Muslim shouts, “Praise be to Allah!” And he jumps out.

Then the Japanese man shouts, “Banzai!” And he jumps out.

Then the Nazi shouts, “Heil Hitler!” And he jumps out.

This goes on and on until there is no one left on the plain except the pilot.  But it’s still too heavy.

The pilot then goes to the door and says to himself, “It’s over.  There’s no way that I can make this plane light enough. There’s no point.”  And he jumps out.

But the plane was never leaking fuel.  The warning light was just malfunctioning.",A possibly offensive joke about an airplane.,0

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied: “I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”

“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”

They saw that a couple of hooligans in St Albert broke into a pool and tried to turn on the water but instead release chlorine gas. No one was hurt but the controversy was that it is to easy to procure and potentially make chemical weapons. The response to this was to put heavy taxes on chlorine and advocating for pools to use argon instead. Now the problem with argon is that it turns bright blue when it comes into contact with urine. So some places of Alberta such a Edmonton are pretty left leaning and they've decided to just pay the taxes, but right places like Calgary have already switched to argon.
