After about five minutes the old man lets another one go and says, 'Aha. I'm ahead 14 to 7.'

Not to be outdone the wife rips out another one and says, 'Touchdown, tie score.'

Five seconds go by and she lets out a little squeaker and says, 'Field goal, I lead 17 to 14.' Now the pressure is on for the old man.
He refuses to get beaten by a woman, so he strains real hard.

""I know a shortcut home through the graveyard!"" declares Paddy.

""No way!"" says Micky, ""I've heard strange stories about that graveyard!""

Undeterred, Paddy sets off through the gloomy fog. Half way through, from behind a huge headstone, out jumps an enormous, black cloaked and hooded figure. From one outstretched gnarled hand he points a finger at the quivering Paddy. ""What's that on your back?!""

""It, it's a hump...""

""Give it to me!""

The gnarled hand removes the hump and Paddy runs home, upright for the first time in 40 years.

News spreads like wildfire through the village so the following night Micky takes an extra few pints and declares that he is going to look for a cure for his limp by the same means.

Later that night he finds himself face to face with the same hulking and hooded figure.

""You"", comes the rasping voice, ""what's that on your back?""

""N, n, n, nothing"" stutters Micky.

post,5j1cv7,2qh72,jokes,false,1482083440,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5j1cv7/dad_is_santa_real/,self.jokes,,"There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000 th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stocking, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the ! ! sleigh and get onto the next house.

 Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second--3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. 

The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousands tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the ""flying"" reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them---Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would adsorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. Merry Christmas","Dad, is Santa real?",154

""I see your ears are working, too,""

""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""
   
""Certainly, sorry about that,"" 

 
Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.

 
""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub.. What are you doing round this way?""
 
""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck. 

 
""I'm a plasterer.""
   
The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.
   
So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.
   
The same thing happens for two weeks.
 
Then one day the circus comes to town.
   
The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him

 
""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""
   
""Sounds marvelous,""says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. 

 
""Get him to give me a call.""

""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

Prepare your noose. This joke will make you want to die but read all of it. Once upon a time, in the purple kingdom of Purpalon, there lived a purple king. One purple day this purple King, who was purply named Purple Purple the fifth, called his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, over to his purple side.

""My purple son,"" the purple king said to purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, ""in another purple kingdom a very short purple distance away there lives another purple king. This purple king has a purple princess that I think that you should marry. Here she is, the purple Princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.""

Purple prince Purple Purple the sixth, upon seeing the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, agreed to marry her. And so, one fine purple day, in the purple garden, Prince Purple Purple the sixth and stood by the purple altar and watched his purple bride-to-be, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, march down the purple aisle wearing a purple wedding dress and carrying a bouquet of purple flowers. Just as the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia reached the purple altar, however, an evil purple magician appeared and cast a purple spell on the purple princess. In a purply moment, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia had vanished.

""What have you done?"" cried the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.

""I have sent the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia to a purple cave in the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in her purple cave, she is guarded by the purple dragon Purplefang. The purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia is purply safe there, but the purple dragon Purplefang, will not let her rejoin the purple kingdoms of Purpalon and Purplonia.""

""You are purply insane,"" the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth said to the Purple magician, but the purple magician had vanished.

""What are you going to do, my purple son?"" the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon asked his son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth.

""I am going to take my purple horse, Purple Lightning, and my purple sword, Purple Death, and go slay the purple dragon Purplefang and rescue the fair purple maiden the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.""

""May the purple God speed you well on your purple journey,"" the purple king Purple Purple the fifth of Purpalon purply blessed his purple son, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth. With that, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth got his purple sword, Purple Death, and his purple horse, Purple Lightning, and rode off to the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia.

The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, rode his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Eventually, the purple horse Purple Lightning got tired, so the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth carried his purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the purple mountain of Mount Purpletop and the purple cave thereon, in which lived the purple dragon Purplefang and his purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Finally, the Purple prince Purple Purple the sixth reached the purple mountain Mount Purpletop. There, in a purple cave on top of the purple mountain, Prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon could see the purple smoke from the purple dragon Purplefang who lived in the purple cave in which the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia was a purple prisoner. Our purple hero, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, climbed the purple mountain Mount Purpletop and slew the purple dragon Purplefang as the purple beast slept purply. The purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon rescued the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. But their purple adventures were not yet come to their purple close. They still had to get home purple and sound.

So...

The purple hero of this purple story, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon, and the newly rescued purple heroine, the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, rode the purple horse Purple Lightning over many purple miles over many purple roads and through many purple fields. He crossed many purple streams and many purple mountains, though none of them were the same purple mountain of Mount Purpletop which in the purple cave thereon the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth slew the purple dragon Purplefang and rescued the purple prisoner the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia. When the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth crossed these purple mountains, he trudged his way through purple snow. Purple sand lined the purple deserts he crossed, and there was purple water in the purple oasises.

Purple alases and purple alaks, though, for it seems our purple heroes, the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon and the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia got lost on their way home, for they wandered into the purple kingdom of an evil purple king, the evil purple king Purple Purponovov of Purplovia. This evil purple man had the purple heroes,the purple prince Purple Purple the sixth of Purpalon and the purple princess Purplina Purple of Purplonia, arrested and thrown into the purple dungeon.

""I have an idea, boss,"" his chauffeur said. ""I've heard you give this speech so many times. I'll bet I could give it for you."" Einstein laughed loudly and said, ""Why not? Let's do it!"" When they arrive at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur's cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein's speech and even answered a few questions expertly.¬†

Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody's fool.

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla. About a month in, the craze has started to wear off.

The young man enters the bedroom and sees the old crone naked and waiting on the bed, spread eagle. As he approaches, the smell of hot musty sex grows and quickly becomes overpowering. He chokes back some vomit and is about to disrobe when he sees a barrel of corn by the bed and has an idea. 

Stealthily, he gets an ear and starts to work. The old woman loves it. She's hooting and hollering and making a real mess of the place. When an ear of corn would get too soggy he'd throw it out the window and use another. They finished, he made his call and the boys left.

There wasn't any serious crime, the pay was good and the hours were easy.  For some reason though, people kept complaining that I was a bad dinosaur.  I didn't understand, but it seemed important to everyone, so I tried to incorporate some dinosaur-like behavior into my work.

I tried growling when I talked to people, but they still complained and mocked me.  I tried wearing a dinosaur mask, eating raw meat and growing my nails out.  Still, complaints and mockery.  It gnawed at me, even though I didn't understand, so I started taking more drastic measures. I needed to be a better dinosaur.

I spent my savings on a full body tattoo of scales.  I had a dentist augment my teeth into fangs.  I stopped wearing clothes and attacked wild animals.  Finally, the mayor came to visit me.

‚ÄúYou've done a great job policing this town and crime is at an all time low, but the people are concerned about your dinosaur behavior.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm so sorry... I've tried everything to be a good dinosaur, I don't know what else to do,‚Äù I growled, stalking back and forth across the room.

‚ÄúWell, until your dinosaur problem is sorted out, I'm afraid we have to let you go. The town has come together to get you the help you need. We've hired you a personal psychologist and given you paid time off until you're better.‚Äù

The psychologist arrived that afternoon.

‚ÄúThe mayor tells me you're great at your job and the people love you, but once you became a cop you started having dinosaur issues.‚Äù

I didn't even try to articulate a response.  I had to impress her, get my job back and regain the town's respect.  I had to show her I was a good dinosaur.  I jumped on the desk, naked and covered in scale tattoos, my fangs gleaming and animal blood running down my face.  I roared with all my might.

‚ÄúYes, well, we need to identify what triggered this problem.  We're going try some minor role-playing. Try to pretend you just pulled me over for speeding.‚Äù

Utterly depressed, I abandoned all my dinosaur mannerisms. I calmly climbed off the desk, walked alongside her chair and said,

‚ÄúLicense and registration ma'am.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir, awefulsaur.‚Äù

So I ate her.",(OC) The bad dino-cop.,3

He walks into the forestry company office and fills out an application as an 'Experienced' logger. It's his lucky day. They just happen to be looking for someone. But first, the bush foreman takes him for a ride into the bush in the company pickup truck to see how much he knows.

The foreman stops the truck on the side of the road and points at a tree. ""See that tree over there? I want you to tell me what species it is and how many board feet of lumber it contains.""

The Newfie promptly answers, ""Dat dere's a Sitka Spruce eh? And she got 383 board feet a' lumber in 'er.""

The foreman is impressed. He puts the truck in motion and stops again about a mile down the road. He points at another tree through the passenger door window and asks the same question. This time, it's a bigger tree of a different class.

""Lord tunderin'! Dat's yer Douglas Fir and she got 690 board feet"", says the Newfie.

Now the foreman is really impressed. The Newfie has answered quickly and got the answers right without even using a calculator! One more test. They drive a little farther down the road, and the foreman stops again. This time, he points across the road through his driver side window.

""And what about that one?""

Before the foreman finishes pointing, the Newfie says, ""A Yeller Cedar, 242 board feet at mos'.""

The foreman spins the truck around and heads back to the office a little pissed off because he thinks that the Newfie is smarter than he is.

As they near the office, the foreman stops the truck and asks the Newfie to step outside. He hands him a piece of chalk and tells him, ""See that tree over there. I want you to mark an X on the front of that tree.""

The foreman thinks to himself, ""Idiot! How would he know which is the front of a tree?""

When the Newfie reaches the tree, he goes around it in a circle while looking at the ground. He then reaches up and places a white X on the trunk. He runs back to the foreman and hands him the chalk.

""Dat's da front a' dat tree fer sure,"" the Newfie states.

The foreman laughs to himself and asks sarcastically, ""How in the hell do you know that's the front of the tree?""

They were perplexed, but due to local law, they could only do the chair once on him per crime. 

After being released, the man went back to operating his train.  Another day, he got very drunk again, got on his train and started killing more people. He was caught again and everybody jumped on the idea of giving him the electric chair treatment again. 

Once again, they asked him what his last meal would be. Once again, he simply said he wanted a single banana. They obliged. He ate it, got on the chair, and once again did not die when the executioner turned it on. 

He was then released again.  Wisely, the police kept a close eye on the man in an attempt to make sure he didn't operate any more trains.  A few weeks later, he got shitfaced, started driving a train again and killed MORE people. Police found him sloppy drunk throwing up on the floor. 

They decided to try the chair once more. They bought a brand new one and tested it with various other criminals. 

He asked for a banana as a last meal once more. Scientists checked everything about the fruit they gave him, before giving it to him. He ate it, sat in the chair again, and they activated it. 

He didn't die again. He was still there, looking at the floor in sadness.

The officials and onlookers were perplexed, angry and baffled. They all bombarded him with questions.  The authorities asked him ""How the heck are you avoiding death by electric chair with a single banana?""

So, Dave says ""sure, name someone, and I'll prove to you that I know them."" After a minute of thinking, the boss suggests Tom Cruise, and so off they go to see him. 

Once they arrive at Cruise's house, Dave knocks on the door, and is immediately buzzed in. Tom Cruise comes running down the stairs and says ""Dave old buddy, good to see you! How've you been?"" The three of them spend the morning talking and laughing over a cup of coffee. 

When it's time to go, Dave's boss is grudgingly impressed, but knowing Tom Cruise doesn't mean he knows everyone in the world. Dave tells him to pick another person. The boss says, ""How about you introduce me to Kim Jong Un, since you know everyone?"", and Dave agrees. 

After a while, the two find themselves at the front gates of Kim's estate. Before Dave even has the chance to ring the bell, Kim Jong Un himself comes rushing out to meet them. ""Dave! I was hoping you'd come visit me again soon! I hope you're doing well!"" Dave and his boss are invited inside, and they spend the evening laughing and talking over margaritas. 

As the two are leaving, the boss turns to Dave and says ""well, I won't deny that I'm impressed you know the leader of North Korea, but I'm still not completely convinced. If you can prove to me that you know the Pope, then I'll believe you one hundred percent."" 

And so, the two travel to the Vatican to meet the pope. When they arrive in St Peter's square, the Pope is out on his balcony, but unfortunately, it's full-on tourist season, and the square is packed to bursting with people. Dave tells his boss ""There's no way the Pope will be able to see me from down here, so if you wait here, I'll go up and meet him on his balcony in front of everyone"", and the boss agrees. 

In a minute or two, Dave emerges from the Pope's balcony alongside the Pope. However, when he looks down at the crowd, Dave sees that an ambulance has careened into the square and the paramedics have started treating someone that looks like his boss. So, Dave runs down into the square, and makes his way over to the ambulance. 

When he arrives, he finds out that his boss passed out, and will recover. Dave kneels down next to the stretcher and asks his boss why he passed out. His boss opens his eyes, turns to look at him and says ""When you walked out onto the balcony with the Pope, the guy next to me turned and asked 'hey, who's that guy up there with Dave?'""",Dave is constantly bragging to everyone at work that he knows everyone in the world.,3

The police then arrive in the bar, and the bartender takes them out back to look around.  They go into the barn and look everywhere.

One cop says ""They might be in those potato sacks"".

He kicks the first one containing the redhead and hears ""Woof, woof"". ""That's a dog"" he thinks to himself.

He kicks the second bag containing the brunette and hears ""Meow, meow"". ""Well that must be a cat"" he thinks.

Finally, he kicks the last bag containing the blonde and hears in a slow voice ""po...ta...to...es!""","A blonde, a redhead, and a brunette walk into a bar.",22

""I know someone who can,"" replied the old man. ""See, I was once in your shoes and had a 25 inch penis. Doctors couldn't help me either. Then one day as I sat at the lake pondering suicide, a frog hopped up on a lily pad and told me that if I asked him to marry me, that 5 inches would disappear from my penis. I know, it sounds absurd.

So the man goes to the local lake and sure enough finds the frog sitting on a lily pad. 'Here goes nothing...'

""Frog...will you marry me?""

""No,"" said the frog.

POOF!! 5 inches disappeared from his penis.

""WOW! It actually works! Frog....will you marry me?""

""No,"" replied the frog.

POOF!! Another 5 inches disappears. The man now has a 15 inch penis and thought that if he could just lose 5 more inches, he might just be able to take a woman to bed or even star in a porn flick. ""I'll ask just one more time and walk away happy with a 10 inch penis.""

When the boy is ten, he comes to grandpa again. ""Can I have five dollars for the ice cream truck?"" Grandpa asks ""Can your dick reach your asshole?"" The boy says no, and grandpa grumbles and takes out five dollars.

The Devil grabs a chair and stabs five holes into it, sits on the chair and farts.

Devil: If you can tell me which hole my fart came out of, I will let you leave Hell and enter Heaven.

Man 1: I'm a scientists, and since you were sitting normally on the chair, your fart would have come out of the hole in the middle.

Devil: No!

The Devil tosses him past the gates and into Hell.

Man 2: I'm an engineer, and I noticed you leaned to the left, so your fart definitely came out of the hole on the right.

Devil: No!

The engineer suffers the same fate as the scientist.

The Devil looks at the last man and grins as he knows just by this man's appearance that he too would be banished to the depths of Hell.

Man 3: I didn't do well in school and I was homeless for that reason, but why wasn't it obvious to those two that your fart came out of your butthole?

I have had enough!!!! I'll never help anyone again......EVER!! I'm just DONE with people! 

Yesterday, I decided to take a man into my home out of the kindness of my heart. I felt so sorry for the guy. Poor thing was standing out in the cold, but this morning he had just vanished. Not a word...not even a goodbye or a thank you for sheltering him!! NOTHING! Oh, and the last straw?!?! The realization that he must have blatantly peed everywhere when I discovered the huge puddle he left on the living room floor!!! That's the thank you I get for being good to people?!?!?! I'm just done with humanity. 

Now I'm going to warn you to watch out for this man! He's going around the north of New York state. He is heavy set with a very pale complexion, wearing nothing but a scarf, he has a nose that looks like a carrot, two black eyes, and his arms are so skinny they look like sticks!!! 
Don't bring him into your house!! What a huge mess he made on the floor!

During dinner he felt a pain building in his groin. To release the pressure, Jack unzipped his fly. His penis immediately sprang from his fly, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll, and then returned to his pants.

One day he was walking through town when he came upon a small store that said True Magic and Wishes. Looking like a rather strange and interesting shop the man entered the store and walked up to the shopkeeper behind the counter.

 ""What do you mean by your sign, true magic and wishes?"" he asked curiously.

""Well you see young man, we have many things that can make all your dreams come true in a single wish or spell,"" the shopkeeper said. ""Do you have something that you always wished for?"" she asked the man. 

Looking abit embaressed ,the man finally said ""Yes, but you cant laugh, ok? My penis is very small and i wish it to be very big, can you help me?"" The man asked.

The shopkeeper smiled ""Dont be saddened by this for i have just the thing for you"". The man watched the shopkeeper open a drawer underneath the counter and pull out a strange leather case, opening the case it contained a gold ring with a mysterious red stone set in it. ""This will help you, but there will be a price"" The shopkeeper said. The man thought about this and if he was to have a big penis he would pay anything to have it. So after settling a price that made both parties satisfied the shopkeeper told him how to use the ring.

""It works quite simple, all you need to do is wear it like a normal ring and bump into people and let them apologise, once this happens your penis will grow a few inches each time it happens"" the shopkeeper said.

The man thanked the shopkeeper and as soon as he was out of the store and on the street he couldnt wait to try it. Slipping the ring on his finger he found that a little old lady was walking his way and he purposely bumped into her and she apologised. Slowly he felt something strange happen to his penis and sure enough he felt it grow a few inches in his pants.

I cant beleive it, it works like a charm, the man thought. Next he bumped into a young man walking his dog and sure enough the young man apogised and again he felt his penis grow a little more, the man was over the moon. The man then saw an old indian man also walking his way and again bumped into him.

The old indian man looked up at the man who had bumped into him and placed his hand upon his shoulder in gester and said. ""A thousand apologies my good man""",The Magic Ring,8

The day of the match arrived and everyone was ready. The celebrities were dressed in their outfits, some practising their throws and catches, others practising their swing. Russell Crowe was selected to umpire.

The match started, and the two teams, ""The Beverly Hills Bosses"" and ""The Hollywood Hustlers"" went to play. The match was going great, with both teams outperforming expectations and making high run totals, and fans of both teams wildly cheering, even more so as the actors occasionally threw their hats into the crowd.

The match was close. The Hollywood Hustlers were one run behind The Beverly Hills Bosses, and Mark Wahlberg was playing. One more strike and they would lose. Of course, even though this was a charity match it was an intense moment for Marky Mark, who was this close to making or breaking it for his team. He didn't want to disappoint. He took a deep breath. Matt Damon threw the ball. Ready with his bat, Mark was ready to swing. He sensed something weird and looked back for a split second, but this cost him: he missed the ball. ""STRIKE THREE!"" yelled Russell Crowe.

Wahlberg was furious. He went up to Crowe and complained, and the conversation soon got into a loud argument. Others around them were soon approaching them to break it up. Wahlberg even threw a few punches at Crowe, not willing to accept this decision. A hurt Crowe, now on the ground, snapped, got up and threw a Falcon Punch at Wahlberg, knocking him down with a single blow like Rocky Balboa did to Apollo Creed. The crowd went insane.

The next day, the headline read ""Star Wars: The Umpire Strikes Back!""
