Anyway, before the ceremony, the White House is attacked by TERRORISTS! and the president is taken hostage. It's up to John and Sister TT (the kids nicknamed her Sister Tough Titties) to battle the terrorists, take back the Oval Office, rescue the President and prevent Certain Nuclear Doom. Sister TT, despite her advanced age is still pretty physically fit and despite her vows pretty good with a firearm. ""I took a vow of celibacy, John, not a vow of non-violence. You should know that from all the paddlings I gave you,"" she winks and smiles.

And of course after a series of victories and setbacks, EXPLOSIONS, broken glass, bleeding feet, gun battles, fires, MORE EXPLOSIONS, and a missing tooth,

The genie responds to the man with a tear coming out of his eye, ""I'm sorry . Even with all my magical power I cannot make that wish come true."" A tear drops out of the man's eye. He really wanted to make a difference. 

""Cheer up!"" genie says, ""You still have a wish! what else might you wish for?""

However as he begins to play he hears the front door open, and footsteps come down the hallway towards the room. In fear of getting caught Johnny quickly hides in his parents closet.

Peeking through a crack in the closet door Johnny sees his mother making love to someone, who isn't his father. He is obviously shocked by this, but does not say anything in fear of getting caught.

However, not five minutes later, his fathers car pulls into the driveway. Johnny's mother frantically pushes her lover into the closet, without realizing Johnny is inside, whispering ""I'll distract him, and you can leave"".

The man is standing, half naked in the closet, without knowing Johnny is also inside. So Johnny decides to break the silence by saying ""Boy it's dark in here!""

The man gets a massive shock, but regains his cool, saying ""Yes, I suppose it is.""

Johnny look at him and says ""I have some football boots. I'll sell them to you for $500.""

The man laughs and says ""You've got to be joking, why on Earth would I buy them for that much?""

""Well my dad's right out there. I could shout for him, and then he'll kick your ass.""

So the man sighs and reluctantly grabs his wallet from his pants, giving Johnny the $500 in exchange for the boots.


Well as the fates would have it, the exact same thing happened a week later.

So after the man was shoved into the closet, Johnny said "" Boy, it's dark in here!""

The man grimaces and says ""Okay what do you want this time?""

""$1000. For my football.""

So the man pays Johnny, and eventually sneaks out.

That weekend Johnny's dad says to him, ""Go grab your football gear, and we'll do some practice.""

But Johnny says, ""Sorry dad but I sold them to a mate of mine""

""Oh really? How much did you get out of it?""

""$1500!"" Johnny said proudly.

His dad was furious however. ""$1500!! You sold your old gear to a friend of yours for that much!! I'm going to take you to Church right now, and your going to repent for your greed!""

So Johnny heads off to Church, and is lead to a confession box to repent for his sins. But Johnny doesn't know what to say, so after a brief awkward silence he says,

""Boy it's dark in here!""

In the morning he ventured outside, looked up and saw that a very large, very angry looking bear had climbed onto his roof and was wandering around growling and battering at the chimney and alike, it seemed trapped up there.
Mr Jones ran inside and without delay flipped the yellow pages open to Bear Catchers. After a quick phone call he was assured the problem was all but taken care of, and within twenty minutes a truck marked 'Coon County Bear Trapper' was pulling into his driveway, on the back was a massive rusty cage and in it the meanest looking mongrel of a dog you could ever find. 
Out of the cabin climbed a burly, rough looking bloke whose jaw worked endlessly on its load of chewing tobacco. Reaching into his flannel pocket to retrieve a cigarette to boot he enquired who was the owner. 
Mr Jones once again wasted no time at all in explaining the situation, when finished the trapper walked over to his truck and pulled out a shotgun, a ladder and a baseball bat. He leaned the ladder against the house, opened the cage up, he then proceeded to tuck the baseball bat under his arm.
He then handed the shotgun to Mr Jones.
As the trapper started up the ladder Mr Jones yelled out asking what the plan was. The trapper paused for a moment, turned to Mr Jones and said ""I'm going up on the roof to beat the bear into submission with this baseball bat. When he falls down to the ground, my dog will bite him with his lockjaw on the testicles, and drag him into the cage on the back of the truck""
With that he started climbing again at which point Mr Jones yelled out ""What do I do with the shotgun ?""
The trapper turned and said ""If I by accident fall off the roof before the bear, shoot that fuckin dog""","A man, a dog, a bears nuts.",4

""Once upon a time there was an old man who wore a jack-o-lantern over his head so he would always be frowning to express that he never made enough money to satisfy his greed.  Everyone made jokes about how he looked like an orange smurf with fake hair. He did not care. He liked the color orange bigly.  

One day he was attending a golf match and noticed a beautiful woman at the clubhouse. He cornered her, pressed his lips against hers, and touched her private parts without even saying hello.  She pushed him away screaming and he returned to his game of golf.  Later he noticed that his golf club seemed to feel a bit larger. Peering through his jack-o-lantern he noticed that his hands actually appeared to be a little smaller. He shrugged it off and continued on with the golf match.

A week later he was admiring his jack-o-lantern in the mirrored finish of an elevator while ascending a huge highrise. A different woman boarded the elevator and he thought ""I am a very powerful man, I am famous, I can do anything."" He tried to press his lips against hers, and grabber her private parts. She screamed and ran out of the elevator.

Later that evening as he shook hands with a business partner he noticed that his hand felt like it was being painfully crushed. He dashed into the bathroom and took off the jack-o-lantern and stared closely at his even smaller hands and screamed into the mirror, ""Oh my god. My hands are even smaller!!""

Each time he kissed or grabbed a woman without her permission his hands increasingly shrunk. Eventually he had no hands. His arms wore down to stubs so short that he could not even take off his jack-o-lantern anymore.

The media had been ignoring him for a while. He was not the star that he once was.  The media were now talking about many other people who made much more money than him, and about people who did good things for the poor and unhealthy. He became increasingly desperate for attention, and tossed and turned every night thinking, ""How could this be happening to me? Nobody talks about how rich and powerful I am anymore!"" ...

""And then what happened, dad??""

""He ran for president.""

Upon entering, the three sisters notice that the grounds are riddled with ducks waddling about. Remembering the rule, they stepped carefully.

However, it was a mere 3 days in before the eldest sister steps on a duck. The second she does so, an angel appeared with a ugly man. The ugly man is chained to the first sister and the angel leaves. 

Horrified, the other two sister moved even more carefully. But, in 3 months, the second sister stepped on a duck. Once again, an angel appeared. This time, with an unbelievably ugly man. The man is chained to the sister before the angel leaves. 

The youngest sister now avoided the ducks with all her power. It wasn't until 3 years later that she stepped on a duck. This time, an angel appeared with the most handsome man she has ever laid her eyes upon. Stunned, she asks, 'What happened?'

So he was delighted when she finally asked him to meet them.

He was very nervous about meeting them, though, and worried about it all the way to their house. As a result when he got to their front door he was in a state of great gastric distress.

Once he was in the house, the problem soon developed into one of acute flatulence which he did his best to restrain.

Eventually though, he couldn’t hold it in one second longer without exploding. And so, as he sat on couch, he let out a tiny fart hoping no-one would notice.

“Spot!” called out the young woman’s mother to the family dog, which was lying at the young guy’s feet.

The young guy was very relieved that the mother was blaming the dog and so he let another, slightly larger one go.

“Spot!” cried the mother, sharply.

The young guy relaxed as he thought to himself, “Great – I’ve got it made. Just one more and I’ll feel fine.”

So he let loose a really big, loud fart.

“Spot!” shrieked the mother. “Get over here before he poops on you!”",A young guy had been dating a beautiful young girl,1

The Monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."" 

The next Sunday, he took the Monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon when he got nervous, he took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door: 

*Sip the vodka; don't gulp.*

*There are 10 commandments, not 12.*
 
*There are 12 disciples, not 10.*

*Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.*

*Jacob wagered his donkey; he did not ""bet his ass.""*

*We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.*

*The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.*

*David slew Goliath; he did not kick the shit outta him.*

*When David was hit by a stone and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.*

*We don't refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""*

*When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper, he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me.""*

*The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the cherry.""*

*The recommended grace before a meal is not ""Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub, yeah God.""*

*There will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a Peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.*",The New Priest Drinks Vodka,504

 car broke down near a monastery
he didnt have anywhere to go so he knocked on their door


and he asked if he could stay the night
they said yeah sure and they accepted him and made him food and even fixed his car
when he was falling asleep, he heard a strange sound the next morning when he woke up, he asked what that sound was and they said ""sorry. we cant tell you. you're not a monk""


he was disappointed but he thanked them anyway and just went on his way after a few years, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery again, they accept him, feed him, and even fix his car when hes falling asleep, he heard the exact same strange sound he heard years ago


 the next morning he asks them what it is
 they say, ""sorry. we cant tell you, youre not a monk""
 so he says hes dying to know and says ""if the only way to find out is to become a monk, how do i become a monk?""


 they tell him, ""you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. when you find these numbers, you will become a monk.""


so he went on his journey and comes back 45 years later he says, ""i have travelled the earth and found what you asked for. there are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.""


 the monks congratulate him and say, ""you are now a monk. we shall now show you the way to the sound.""
 they lead him to a wooden door
the head monk says ""the sound is right behind that door""


the man reaches his arm for the knob, but the door is locked. he says, ""very funny. can i have the key?""


 they give him the key and he opens the door  behind the wooden door there is a door made of stone
 they provide him with the key, and  he opens it only to find a door made of ruby so he asks for the key,


 they give it to him, and behind the door is a door of silver he asks for the key they provide him with it
and behind the door he finds a door of emerald
so he asks for that key, 

and they provide him with it
 only to find a door of foam behind it so once again they give him the key and he opens it and he finds a door of amethyst so he requests for the key and they listen to him, and he finds a door of cotton they have the key

 and give it to him, he opens the door and finds a glass door so he asks for the key once again and they give it to him, behind that door he finds a plastic door this door has no key. he opens it,and behind it is a door made of spinach


 this door is locked. so he asks for the key. and they give it to him behind that, he finds a door made of ice
he unlocks the door and then finds a door made of topaz

 they provide him with the key, and he opens it
 only to find a door made of really thick paper he asks for its key, and they provide him with it he opens the door and finds another one made out of aluminium so he asks them for that key, and they give it to him.

he unlocks the door
and finds a door made of silicon they tell him,
""this is the final door. here is its key.""


 the man is relieved to no end he unlocks the door, and turns the knob and he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound right in front of him
wanna know what it is?

An Atheist is running down the street one day, and he sees a little girl who is giving away puppies that her dog had just given birth to. 

He goes up to the girl and says, ""Little girl, I think it's wonderful that you're doing such a good thing.""

The little girl says, ""Thank you, Sir. Would you like a puppy? They are Atheist puppies.""

He declines and jogs onward. The next day, he jogs past the same girl and decides to talk to her again. ""You know what, little girl? I think I'll take one of those puppies after all, seeing as how they're Atheist.""

The girl says, ""I'm sorry Sir, but they're not Atheist puppies any more. They are Jehovah's Witness puppies now.""

The man asks, ""They are? They were Atheist puppies yesterday. How do you know that they changed their faiths?""

She says, ""Well, just after they were born their eyes were shut and they were Atheist, but after several days, their eyes were opened and they started going door to door preaching the word of God.""",Religious puppies,0

""Congratulations! You're the 100th billion person to die! You can choose to live on in heaven OR choose to live forever back on Earth! As long as you kill a person, that person will give you 20 more years to live! But with a cost..."" 

Of course I had to choose the latter. I still had a lot to live for. I've made a decision that when I reached 30 I have to act so that my looks stay the same. I've been doing this for about 80 years now. This is my 4th target. 

I know this is bad... I know. But I've always picked those who have nothing to live for. Homeless depressed people, those without family and the old age etc. 

No one will miss them. I'm sure of it, this is why I make background checks before doing anything. 

I can't really say why... it's an addiction. Not the killing... but staying alive. To know that I can live past anything makes me want to keep going, no matter the cost.

It was the night before Christmas and my target this time is a man by the name of Albert Kane. 10 years ago, he was once a respected construction foreman just trying to make his family live good lives. He has lost his five year old daughter and wife in a car accident. His life went downhill from there. Excessive drinking, drugs, multiple arrests. Then he lost his job, his credibility, and his home. All he had left was the shirt on his back and a backpack. 

I hosted a Christmas party for the homeless at the community centre. Its the least I can do for what I'm about to do to this poor man. I'll let the others and him enjoy themselves. Good food, drinks, even a gaming centre I organised at the back! Then when Albert is drunk enough I'll bring him back into the alley and do my ""business"".

--------------

Finally I got him into the alley while he was drunk. I didn't use anything sharp, or anything blunt, or even a gun. I just gave him a spiked drink and all I had to do was wait. 

I helped him down as the poison took effect. The poison was working fine. It made him sleepy real easily and after a few mins he _slept_, for good. 

""May you rest in peace with your family.""

Now I have to wait for _Death_. I saw his backpack and took a peak in it. 

Not much but one thing I saw was a book, an album. It was his family album. Almost all of the pictures seemed missing but there were 5 that were still kept.

Here's one with him and his wife taking their wedding vows. 

Another one on their honeymoon in France (The Eiffel tower was right behind them). 

Seems like this one was taken before his pregnant wife was admitted to the ER. And another one of his new born baby daughter in the hospital room. 

This last one seemed a bit weary in its condition. It was him and his daughter on site at his job, he was taking her on a ride in one of the construction diggers and it seemed like she was laughing and enjoying it... Suddenly I hear a familiar voice behind me.


""Hey bud. I'm here."" It was _Death_. 

Even though I've already seen him 3 times I still can't get used to him. 

""So this is the guy huh?""

""Ya... will he be okay?"" 

""He will. I know he's due to heaven and I am here to help him move on. And I'm sure his family will be happy seeing him again. But that's half the reason of why I'm here. So... the _cost_. You have it ready?""

""Yup.""

""Alright then. That will be __$3.50__."" As Death takes the bill and change they disappear into a cloud of smoke on his hands. ""The payment has been given. See you in 20 years!"" 

""Alright. See you Death!"" 

Now time to live another 20 years more! 

__THE END__ ",A man has to kill to add 20 years into his life. But at a price...,9

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.  
Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.""  
The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.""  
And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.  
The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.  
The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.  
""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""  
The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, ""If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""  
And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.  
The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.  
The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.  
""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""  
The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""  
""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.  
""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father, ""but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.""
And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.  
The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.  
""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""  
The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humour me, dear father.""  
The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.
The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.
""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.""
One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.
The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.  
The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.  
The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.  
""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.""
It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.
The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.  
""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again.""
That night, the son spent on board the tanker.  
The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.  
A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.  
His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""  
Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""  
The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""  
""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""  
The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.  
""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""  
The son nodded weakly.  
The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.  
""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.  
The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.  
""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass the trial. The first step of the trial was to go into the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.


The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explains the trial to him-you have to shove the fruits up your ass without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten. The first apple went in...but on the second one he winced in pain, so he was killed and went to heaven. The second guy arrives with ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him, he thought to himself that this should be easy. 

1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...but on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter, therefore also was killed. The first guy and the second guy met in heaven.

The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the yard, scoots back into the house.. We didn't want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird. My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit.

Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night… So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say goodbye to my mother.'

A few minutes later, I get into the cab. 'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away. 'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me.  But it worked!

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.'

'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.

They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend.

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?' 'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, ER, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?'

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have to admit that I did.'

'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why do you ask?'

He gave his wife a peck on the cheek and fell asleep.
When he awoke he found a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe.
“Who the hell are you?” Demanded Jason, “and what are you doing in my bedroom?”.
The mysterious Man answered “This isn’t your bedroom and I’m St. Peter”.
Jason was stunned “You mean I’m dead!!! That can’t be, I have so much to live for, I haven’t said goodbye to my family…. you’ve got to send me back straight away”.

St Peter replied “Yes you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.” Jason was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen. A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground.

“This ain’t so bad” he thought until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him.
The farmyard rooster strolled over and said “So you’re the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?”
“It’s not so bad” replies Jason, “but I have this strange feeling inside like I’m about to explode”.
“You’re ovulating” explained the rooster, “don’t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before”.
“Never” replies Jason.
“Well just relax and let it happen”.
And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that had ever happened to him… ever!!!

The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous SMACK on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting “Jason, wake up you drunken bastard, you’re shitting the bed!”",Jason came home from the pub late one Friday evening...,2183

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

You must complete this ritual to stay amongst us until your people arrive to save you. If you cannot complete the ritual, you shall die.""

The three men, accept the challenge offered by the Chieftain. ""Your first task, is to provide for the tribe. Go out into the jungle and bring me ten pieces of one kind of fruit."" Our three heroes depart to the jungle for their first test.

Bill is first to return, and he presents 10 oranges to the Chief. The leader says, ""Congratulations on completing the first part of the ritual. You have done well. The second trial is to prove that pain is nothing to you. You must place each piece of fruit into your ass without making a noise or facial expression."" 

Bill is able to get three oranges up his rear before the can take it no long and starts to wimper, and he is killed.

Bob returns next, with ten bunches of grapes. The leader of the tribe gives him the same speech he gave Bill. Bill begins easily sliding grapes one at a time into his sphincter, and when he has but three grapes left, he starts laughing so hard he shits out the grapes and is immediately killed.

Bob meets Bill at the pearly gates, and Bill asks, ""You were only THREE GRAPES away from victory, why did you start laughing?""

post,58yuoc,2qh72,jokes,false,1477234038,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/58yuoc/chinese_torture/,self.jokes,,"Dave was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. 

""I'm lost,"" said Dave. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 

""OK,"" said Dave, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to Dave as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" 

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" Dave thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic Dave glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""

The town was famous for making specialized hand made leather shoes as everybody who lived in that town knew how to make them. Slowly and gradually handmade shoes started becoming a lost art. 


During the year 1816, when industrialization was at its peak, everything was being made by machines. As a result the residents of that town were not able to make enough money to support their family. That was the year when a shoe manufacturing company identified the opportunity to use the skilled and cheap labor force of that town and decided to open its state of the art factory 50 kms away from the town and promised to employ everyone. The news brought happiness to the town as no one wanted to go out of town as they all loved where their ancestors lived for generations. That would  also bring prosperity to the town. As promised the shoe company opened its factory and every skilled labor in the town was employed. Soon the company's products became a huge hit in the world with slick and comfortable designs. The company soon gained the market leadership position. 


Fast forward 200 years to year 2016, company's 65 years old HR manager, Mr. OFFice is dealing with a big issue. The employees who have worked in the company for several years have now become complacent and big time liars. The employees would go home after lunch and call in sick. On several occasions, Mr. OFFice discovered that it was a lie and they were in fact fine. It then became a routine affair, and every employee started to do that. Of the employees that did return after lunch were either very jumpy or very sleepy. Since the company valued its employees, it believed in not firing anyone from the job. However the habit was a big pain as it was hurting the productivity and as a result the revenues. Mr. OFFice tried several traditional HR programs to motivate employees to not lie and come to work everyday. Incentives were offered, appreciation for full day of work awards, not to lie awards etc. Management spent thousands of pounds to change this behaviour.  But to Mr. OFFice's dismay, it did not bear fruit.


Management decided to fire Mr. OFFice and hired a young and flamboyant Mr. ONice as their new HR manager. ONice was a Harvard MBA, was smart and very diligent. He was briefed about the situation on the first day of the job. Instead of designing new HR programs, he decided to speak with the employees to find the root cause of the problem. Soon he organized a meeting with the management and told that the behaviour can be changed. He figured that the employees were feeling tired after working for few hours and they would go out for drinking a tea. They wouldn't use the office coffee machine as everybody loved tea and the kitchen would never have it. Now since the factory was in middle of nowhere, the nearest tea shop was 40 kms away from the factory. The interesting point was the shop was only 10 kms from the town, where everybody lived.  So after having the tea, employees decide to go home rather than to come back. They knew the company would never fire them and hence everybody took advantage of the situation. 


Soon Mr. ONice scrapped the old coffee policy and installed a new tea machine with a wide variety of flavours to select from. Suddenly instead of going home after lunch, the employees flocked around the new stylish tea machine and there was a huge line up everyday.  The waiting time was very high and it was not helping the production targets. Mr ONice announced that tea would be served at their workstations and promoted several other programs that included serving tea in conference rooms, a tea gift hampers for the best employee, cookies with the tea for a month for employees who produced most shoes. The new policy was an unprecedented  overnight success. The management was happy because employees were not lying to go to home everyday and even loved staying late hours in the factory, they were also meeting their production targets. 


To attribute this success, management decided to ask only one question to each employee in a survey. ""Which is a better policy? The coffee policy or the tea policy?""


The employees responded unanimously '""ONice Tea is the best policy""

As the man threw a few bucks into her cup the nun launched into a long tirade about the evils of alcohol. She went on and on about how alcohol was tearing apart the fabric of society and how it was the root of all the city’s problems.

Slightly ticked off at having to listen to this, the guy said, “Listen sister, I work hard for my money and sometimes at the end of a long day I like a drink or two. That doesn’t make me a bad person. I have a wife I idolize and two wonderful kids at home. I provide for my family, I volunteer my time to several local service clubs and I contribute regularly to various charities. Yet you stand here and condemn me just because I drink the occasional glass of scotch!”

The nun was slightly taken aback and replied, “I see your point my son and I apologize if I offended you but the alcohol is such a powerful demon that all who consume it are doomed…”

“Look there you go again,” said the man. “How can you make such a sweeping statement. Have you ever even TRIED alcohol?”

“Of course not!” gasped the nun, “The evil alcohol has never touched my lips.”

“Do you really think that one glass of booze can change you from a devout nun to some kind of evil degenerate?”

“Well, I really don’t know …”

“I’ll tell you what, come into the bar with me and I’ll buy you a drink. One drink. I’ll prove to you that “evil” is not inside the glass, it’s inside the person.”

“Oh, I could never be seen going into such a den of iniquity, it’s out of the question. However, your comment about evil residing in the person rather than the glass is quite intriguing. I must admit you’ve aroused a curiosity in me.”

“Well let’s go inside and settle this!”

“No my son, I could never enter such a place… but how about this. Take my tin cup with you and fill it with this “scotch” you mentioned. Bring it out to me and I’ll try it.”

“You’re on!” said the guy.

The nun removed all the change and handed him the tin cup. He went into the bar and said to the bartender, “Two scotch on the rocks, and could you put one of them in this tin cup please?”

The bartender sighed and asked, “Is that nun out there again?”",The Crusading Nun.,160

Father Bob had overdone it the day before working in the garden and wouldn't be able to hear confession. Nervous Father John had been appointed to take his place, but not to worry, Father Bob had a cheat card listing all the usual sins and the penance he proscribed. Father John had nothing to worry about.

Most of the day went by uneventful. He heard tons of the usual stuff: I hate my father, I slapped my child, I thought nasty thoughts about my neighbor's wife. In each case, Father John pulled up the crib sheet, followed the mess of lines and doled out the requisite punishment.

Around lunchtime, Loni Feist sat down in confession with something startling to share. ""Father,"" she said, ""Last night, I was with a man other than my husband. We had dinner, he took me home and out in the car, just to pay him for his kindness, I gave him a blowjob.""

*""Jesus, Mary-Mother-of-God!""* cried Father John. 

*""Listen, Father, I knew it was wrong and I shouldn't have done it, but the way I figure, I saved myself a bit of sin, seeing as how I didn't actually have sex with him.""*

Father John certainly seen the logic in the argument and began frantically searching the crib sheet for help. When none was found, he quickly excused himself and ran off into the church in search of Father Bob.

Father Bob wasn't in his room, he wasn't in the garden, he wasn't in the restroom, the kitchen or anywhere else in the rectory that Father John could see. At his wit's end, Father John ran across big Mike, the gardener, as he was carefully putting away the garden hose.

""*Quick, Mikey. You know Father Bob pretty well and have been here a while. Tell me, what does Father Bob give for a 'blow job?'*""

I don’t even know if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and that seems to bring him happiness. But I don’t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there… at night I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that’s on my arm. A lady that I once loved, doc. I don’t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch… I no longer love him. As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn’t such a coward, then perhaps…perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all. Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I’m a moth, just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I’m not feeling good.""

The chief said, ""For trespassing on our sacred land you will be put to death in 3 days, but at the morning of each day I will grant you one request.""

Two young men from the tribe woke him up early the first morning and asked him what his first request is.

""Just let me talk to my horse,"" was all the cowboy asked. 

They brought him to the horse, and the cowboy gently grabbed the horse and wispered in it's ear. 

The horse immediately takes off at full sprint, and two hours later comes back with a beautiful blonde girl riding nude. She goes into the teepee with the cowboy, and after having sex, she takes off on the horse again. 

The two men from the tribe were obviously impressed with this, and on the second morning asked the cowboy what he wanted as his second request.

""I just want to talk to my horse."" 

So once again, they took him to his horse, he wipers in his ear, and the horse takes off at full sprint. 

Two hours later, the horse brings back an even more beautiful dark haired girl, who was fully nude. She goes into the teepee with the cowboy, they have sex, then she leaves on the horse.

The two men from the tribe were really impressed this time, and on the third morning, they came to ask him what his final request was.

(says Joe Biden), I know I'm an ugly, bumbling, retard, with ridiculous hair plugs, so I've long since accepted that women don't find me attractive.  But for your whole life, the most beautiful women have always loved you.  I've wanted to know what it was like to be a man who actually gets the women.

Trump says, well... you spend every day in the White House with Barack.  I mean, sure he's an idiot, hates America, and has destroyed the US economy, but some women like him anyway, why don't you ask him?

Biden replies, LOL... I mean, yes, its true, some women do actually like Barack, but c'mon, everyone knows he's gay, what do you think that whole ""Reggie Love is my body guard"" thing was *really* about?  

Trump laughs to himself, and says... haha yes, I guess it was kinda obvious, even without having heard all the rumors.   Not that there is anything wrong with being gay, of course... but a guy like Obama hiding his true self kinda makes sense, its not like he is really capable of telling the truth in any area of his life anyway.

Biden says, lol yup, you got that right, between just you and me, Obamas a communist, and fake in just about everything he says.

Trump replies, tell me something that isn't obvious!

Biden says, well? c'mon, you see... being surrounded by a liar and beta male like obama how desperate I am to hear about anything from the life of a real Alpha male like you, please just tell me about something from your dating life?  please, please, I'll kiss your feet!

Trump takes mercy on him, and says have SOME pride Joe, get up off the floor, stop your groveling, and I'll tell you something from my life.

Thank you, Sir, says Joe (practically with tears in his eyes)

Donald Trump, stands tall, and tells Joe Biden, I love Melania, but we have an open marriage (by mutual agreement)  In fact, just last night, I slept with a Brazilian woman.

He takes this research, returns to England, and successfully publishes. While it's not universally accepted, his work is fairly well received, and the scientific community understands its significance. They recognize him with an award banquet. 

Darwin shows up to the banquet and sits at the head table as the guest of honor. Hundreds of people congratulate him and thank him for his work. But something's not quite right-- he feels like the experience is incomplete. So, as the night goes on, Darwin gets a little despondent. Finally, it comes time for his toast. The president of the scientists' society stands up to honor Darwin. He says, ""Mr. Darwin, for your contributions to natural science and to the nation of England, we salute you.""

She seemed to be beating around the bush.

People always say I should be lucky to be able to live off workers comp, but it cost me an arm and a leg!

I was out of town for a couple weeks and I decided letting my 420 friendly, homeless and in desperate need of money buddy of mine take care of my parakeets for a bit of pocket cash. I somehow managed to kill 2 birds with one stoner.

I used to be depressed, this is my story of my attempted suicide. 
It was late one night after I had gotten dumped by my GF, fired from work due to ""destructive behavior"", and both of my parents died in a house fire. I sat down with a my juice box in hand, only to have a hole in my suction device. I looked far and wide, but that ended up being the last straw.

My friend thinks he's more clever then me, wearing these crappily made natural fiber hoodies to save money. Little does he know I could always pull the wool over his eyes.

I once shared a prison cell with Ron Jeremy, in which he taught me proper etiquette for when I've dropped my soap. He gave me the whole nine yards.

I accidentally released a shit ton of corrosive AgF2 into the atmosphere. It's alright though, it's supposed to help with global warming and just goes to show every cloud has got a silver lining.

I always thought my wife was creepy, but I recently divorced her after she killed my best friend. Afterwards I learned she would use sharpie to record secrets and violent fantasies behind my favorite painting. I should've seen the writing on the wall.

I found my ex-GF fucking my best friend since highschool. She got off Scott Free, but I didn't let her get off scott free.

I tried to keep my girlfriend from breaking up with me, but I was beating a dead horse. 
Apparently girls don't find that forgivable.

I was fishing up on a snow covered Alaskan lake with some friends, but they weren't very social. To get them to talk I tried the break the ice. 

I tried to join a tree climbing community, but they seemed very closed off and I wasn't sure if they were gonna let someone into their tight circle with no experience. I decided I would go out on a limb.



I'm understand my joke making skills aren't of Presley quality, so I'll help everyone out and go now.

The communist government had heavily restricted abortion, however, and so Sergey had to bribe doctors to try to perform the procedures. He tried and tried, and several doctors were willing, but yet the procedure was never successful. No matter what the doctors did to try to terminate the pregnancy, the child lived on.

Finally, in desperation and losing faith in the Russian healthcare system, Sergey took out a loan and flew himself and Natasha to Paris to try one more procedure. Finally, this one was successful.

The guy behind the counter says that he only has one and that it’s a real “smart-ass” with a vulgar vocabulary and rude temperament.

The woman says, “That’s okay, I know how to handle smartasses like that. I want the parrot anyhow.”
So the woman gets the bird home, puts it in her room, and starts to get ready for bed. Just as she gets her slacks off the parrot says: “Awk . . . nice legs, baby!”

Well, the woman isn’t gonna take such abuse, so she takes the bird out of the cage and puts it in the freezer for three minutes. While the parrot’s in the freezer, he becomes real sure that this was the wrong thing to say, and is making a large mental note about saying that again.

The next night, again the woman is getting ready for bed. This time the parrot knows not to say anything about her legs, but after she removes her blouse, and then her bra, the parrot just can’t resist any longer. He blurts out, “Awk . . . great tits, baby, let’s see ya shake um.”

Once again the woman gets upset and she decides that instead of three minutes in the freezer, she is going to keep the parrot in for five minutes. This time the parrot has lots of time to think. Remorse gives way to desperation, and finally to anger.

Finally, the woman opens the freezer door, takes out the near frozen parrot and says, “Well, have you learned your lesson?”
The parrot, still shivering and barely able to speak, says, “Awk, yea, yea, sure, sure, but I have just one question.”
The woman says, “Yes?”
The parrot says, “Awk . . . what did the turkey do, ask for a blow job?”",This is a story of a smartass parrot.,164

She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes.""

The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, ""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned ☝her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""

Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.

Attention female readers : This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.

Male readers: Please scroll down.

The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife.

Moral of the story: Women think they're really smart.

Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show.

Note: If you are a woman and are still reading this; it only goes to show that women never listen.
