Kelly replies: ""The other night when I woke up in the middle of night I crawled up to my parents bedroom, peaked through the keyhole and saw my mother laying on the bed with her legs in the air, screaming ""Oh, God, oh God, I'm coming!!!""

Next up was the Army general. He wanted to be measured from the tip of his finger to the tip of his other finger. It was 80 inches. He received $800,000.

The two generals were very happy with their earnings.

Finally the Marine general came up. He said he wanted to be measured from the tip of his dick to the tip of his balls. The man said, ''Sir, do you know how much the other generals received?''

The general said no. ''Sir, they received $690,000 and $800,000 respectively, are you sure that is what you want measured?''

The general said, ''Just do it!''

The man dropped the general's pants and measured his dick. When he went for the general's balls, they weren't there. The man said, ''Sir, where are your balls.''

The general said, ''I left them back in Vietnam.""

They are eventually trapped by a tribe of cannibals, when one of them manages to barter a deal with the chief.

The chief decides that if each man can complete a set of three tasks he sets, the tribe will show them the way back to the nearest town. However failing the tasks will result in them staying for dinner time.

The first task is to go out into the rainforest and collect 10 of the same pieces of fruit. Each man sets about the task, off into a different direction.

The first returns with 10 apples, the chief says the next task is to insert each piece of fruit into his ass without any emotion displaying on his face. 

He gets to 6 apples before he winces, and is killed to be eaten.

The second returns with 10 berries, again the chief sets out the same second task. The man gets to 9 berries before he bursts out laughing, again he is killed to be eaten. 

In heaven, the first and second man meet, the first man asks,
“Why would you burst out laughing?! You were so close to completing the task!”

The second replies,
“I couldn’t help it, I saw the third guy coming back with pineapples.”",Three men are captured by cannibals,187

your penis is causing a strain on your larynx, and this results in
your stuttering. The only solution to this is to perform a penis
transplant."" The man was really tired of his stuttering, so he agreed
to a transplant. Several days later the doctor called the man up and
informed him that they have found a suitable donor. The transplant
operation was successfully performed and the man could speak without
any stutter.

At first he was happy, but after a while he began to miss his large
penis, and how the girls used to love it. He finally went back to his
doctor and said, ""Doctor, I am grateful for the opportunity you have
given me to speak without a stutter, but I miss my old penis. Please

penises back.""

post,9bv14i,2qh72,jokes,false,1535732550,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9bv14i/joe_is_forgetful_and_fancy/,self.jokes,,"Joe always got compliments on his looks, especially the way he dressed. He always looked like he was going somewhere important, and wore the same jacket, tie, pants and shirt whenever he left the house.

One day, he had parked his car outside a cafe to grab a coffee, and, when he came out, there was a meter maid writing out a ticket. When she saw him, she immediately stopped writing and started to compliment him on his perfect features, and his impeccable sense of style. She spent a good five minutes telling him the world would be a better place if everyone took a little more time to invest in the way they looked. He smiled indulgently and told her gently that he needed to get going, so she should go ahead and finish writing the ticket, he knew that he was parked illegally. She ripped it up into a hundred pieces and threw them into the garbage. Instead of giving him a ticket, she showed him her list of ticketable offenses, and bade him check them over before parking next time, to avoid getting a ticket. He thanked her and tucked the list away in his front pocket.

He was driving down the road, enjoying his coffee, when he spotted a pregnant cat in labor on the side of the road, all alone. Being the good samaritan he was, he pulled over and gathered the cat up into a cardboard box. He drove to the nearest animal hospital, and rushed inside, unknowingly locking his keys in his car. The first person he saw immediately dropped what he was doing to come help the handsome man with the cat, who was about to deliver her first kit. The man handed off the feline to the vet tech, and then sat back down at his desk, before he began complimenting Joe on his stylish dress. Joe stopped him midsentence, and began walking into the vets examination room, when the man stopped him. ""You can't go back there, I'm afraid. It's not allowed. You undoubtedly would improve the situation, and surely know more about delivering kittens than our veterinarians, but it just *isn't done.* We need *credentials,* you see, before you would be allowed to help with the procedure.""

Joe begins asking questions, but, while the man is explaining the regulations involved, the metermaid from before bursts into the lobby, shouting for the doctor. ""I've just hit a dog! It was outside the zoo! It ran out in front of my squadcar!"" The man jumps up and bolts for the door. When he comes back in, he's carrying, not a dog, but a *hyena* in his arms. ""It must have escaped, we don't have a doctor that specializes in African wildlife! This handsome, well dressed man probably could save it but he doesn't have the *credentials!*"" As Joe turns to leave, sadly unable to help, the man reaches behind the desk, and pulls out a brochure. ""Please, I don't have time to finish explaining the minutiae of why you're not legally permitted to help us, but this pamphlet will explain everything!"" With that, he whisks the animal into the back room. Speechless, Joe folds up the paper and sticks it inside his pants pocket.

Standing in front of the vet's office, he shakes his head and reaches for his keys. Realizing what happened, he looks for a payphone (as this is before the advent of cellphones), and sees one across the street. Looking both ways, he crosses and drops a few quarters in, dialing the number for a mechanic that he trusts across town. ""Joe, you good-looking fellow, of course we can help you! But it'll be a little while, we're extremely busy this afternoon. I'll tell you what, you go get some lunch or something and, in an hour or two, come on back and we can help you out.""

Joe thanks him and hangs up. He starts walking to a piano bar he knows of, just a few blocks away, thinking about the hyena and hoping it will be okay. Pretty soon he sees the bar, and stops at the crosswalk, where he sees an older woman who is also waiting for the signal to cross. He strikes up a conversation with her, and it turns out that she's going to the bar as well. They decide to have a drink together, and as they sit down she reveals that she is also a scholar of African mammals. As it turns out, she was also in the graduating class with Joe's own mother! During this exchange, Joe accidentally pushes his wallet off the bar onto the floor of the barman's side, and as they begin along this new line of conversation, a few young men sidle up to the bar, looking around nervously. One of them tentatively holds up his finger to the bartender.

""Um, e-excuse me sir? Do you have any Budweiser on t-tap? I'd like to buy a cup for me and my friends p-please?""

The bartender looks skeptically at the boys, ""Any of you got ID?"" When they sheepishly indicate that they do not, he proceeds to educate them as to the legal guidelines as far as who he can serve. He points to the poster on the wall, contained elegantly in a frame carved in the shape of pouncing hyenas. The old woman exclaims, ""I must have it! How much?""

The bartender runs his chin thoughtfully, and then states ""If you can answer this one question about hyenas, you can have it for free. What is the scientific name for hyena?""

Flustered and overwhelmed, she has a moment of complete blankness, and Joe jumps in, ""Why, that would be *Hyaenidae* friend!"" The bartender claps and rips the picture off the wall. It's far too big for her to carry, so Joe helps her bring it outside, where they disassemble it into pieces small enough that she can carry them in a large shopping bag. The paper contained within starts to blow away, and Joe catches it and stuffs it in his jacket pocket.

He heads back to the vet's office, just in time for the tow truck showing up with the mechanic. In his hurry to help our hero, the man parks, unknowingly, in the fire lane. They get to work on opening Joe's car up, when the front door of the office flies open, and the distraught metermaid flies out. ""Joe, they couldn't save him! The hyena is...*WHO PARKED IN A FIRE LANE?!*""

The mechanic looks at his truck, and his face pales when he realizes what he's done. He turns to Joe, ""Is there anything I can do to get out of this?"" Joe sadly shakes his head. The metermaid looks from one to the other, and realizes who the man is here to help.

""Well, since you're a friend of Joe, maybe there's some kind of deal we can work out, so I can look the other way.""

Not wanting the poor man to have to spend his own money, Joe reaches for his wallet, and realizes he has lost that as *well,* and that he no longer possesses any valuables with which to bribe the conflicted metermaid. He looks down at his fine garments, sighs, and begins removing his pants, jacket, tie, and shirt. When the metermaid turns around, she finds Joe holding a neatly folded piled of the afformentioned clothes, including all the contents of his pockets. ""Joe, what on earth are you giving me?""

He responds: ""well, I know it's an awful payoff, but here, you can have my **law-suit**.""",Joe is forgetful and fancy,1

**Genesis**

**Chapter 1**

Everything just kind of started. God was in the dark, chilling by himself. Nobody knows when God came to be; He has just been. Apparently He operates outside of what we can think or fathom. So yeah, God was and then everything we know just kind of appeared.

Well, not just “kind of appeared,” God spoke, and it made stuff. He got tired of hovering over the void (which had also always just been there). It was pitch black and filled with water, and there was not much to do. It was dark and He was bored. So God said, “I need some light.”

Then light decided to be a thing. God liked it.

But for whatever reason, God didn’t want this new light and the old dark to be together. He thought they didn’t match. So God separated them with something called time. Then he gave the light and the dark names; Day and Night. So time kept Day and Night away from each other. God liked light better, so He called Day and Night together a collective “day.” So by His standards, making light took one day.

It seems like it only took one day for God to get bored of the light. He wanted more. So he said, “I want some space.”

Then space happened. You know, like the universe. In my opinion, He went a little overboard on the amount of space He created. But again, He operates outside of what we can fathom, so to each their own, I guess.

Making all that space took up another whole day. So God, being happy with His day’s work, decided to call it quits for day two.

When the boring Night left and Day popped up again, God was in the mood to keep making more stuff. He already made all the space anybody could ever need, so He decided to make a toy for Himself, sort of like an interactive video game. On day three He started laying the groundwork by collecting some of Night’s water and putting it all together. He also put some dry, solid places in between parts of the water. He decided these needed names too, so He called the collection of water “Sea,” and the patches of solid dry places He called “Land.”

God still had some time left on this day, so He decided to add more detail to the land. He decided to put some things in the land that would grow over time. Some would change color and shape, some would not change color, some would be shorter or taller than all the rest, and some would live longer than others too. He put them all over the place on top of the land, and even a few down in the sea. He called these things plants, and gave them the ability to create more of themselves by giving them something called “seeds.” Then He ran out of time on day three; however, He was still happy with His work.

On day four, Night started to become jealous of Day. God, being the great guy that He is, decided to throw Night a bone. He put little tiny lights up in the Night sky, and all throughout space, so that Night had some light to keep it company. He even locked Day up into a big bright ball, and gave Night a big ball that reflected light from Day’s side of time. And, per the usual, God named these things too; the little lights He called “Stars,” the big bright ball he called “Sun,” and the other big reflecting ball he called “Moon.” Day and Night were both happy after this and stayed on the side of time that they were supposed to. After God did all this, He was happy too, and the day ended there.

Day five came and God remembered He had started making a toy for Himself. He turned His attention to it again and decided to put some things inside of the sea and up above the land that could move around and eat the plants. He like the plants he made, but he didn’t want too many. He also thought it’d be cool to have some of the new things eat each other, too, so that there weren’t too many of them either. He made them in all sorts of different shapes, sizes, and colors. He called the ones above the land “birds,” and the ones in the sea He called “fish.” He also gave the birds and fish a way to create more of themselves by giving them a specific way to come into contact with each other. God liked what he did on the fifth day and stopped there.

Day six came, and God took a good hard look at His new toy. He liked it, but as any good toy designer knows, there’s usually always room for improvement. He liked the birds and fish, but the plants were pretty much alone on the land. The birds went down to the land every now and then when they got tired, but there was nothing that moved around amongst the plants. God felt a little tired too, so He decided to finish up His toy on day six.

He started by adding some things to the ground of all shapes, colors, and sizes. They didn’t have wings like the birds did, so they were stuck on the ground. Like the fish and birds, some of them ate the plants and some of them ate each other. He decided to call these land things “animals.”

The day was almost over and God was about to close up shop on His toy when He realized that He didn’t make anything that looked like Him. He didn’t like that, so He decided to put His personal stamp on the toy. After much deliberation, He decided He would make this creature an animal. He wanted it to be just like Him, but to give the creature a challenge He didn’t give it His hovering capabilities. So it was stuck on the ground with the rest of the animals. He called his final creation “human.” Human’s purpose, like God felt about His own purpose, was to be in charge of the plants and animals and birds and fish and land and sea. He didn’t give human control over day and night, because those belonged to time and time was what made God’s toy work. So God remained the sole controller of day, night, and time. God decided to call the toy “Earth.” He liked it and said, “Let the game begin!”

God was tired after he finished his toy, and slept all night after the sixth day, and all through the seventh day as well. I would be tired too, if I had just made all of that, so it’s understandable. God thought He was done with His toy at this point, but He forgot one vital component…","Here's the Beginning of What I Call ""The Kind-Of Bible."" (Long; 3-4 mins to read)",1

""Oh no, dear,"" replied granny, ""many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. It was just the right rhythm. Nice and slow and even. Nothing too strenuous, simply in on the Ding and out on the Dong."" She then paused to wipe a tear, and continued, ""He'd still be alive if the ice cream truck hadn't come along.""",Sunday Morning Sex,2135

At a wine merchant's warehouse the regular taster died, and the director started looking for a new one to hire. He posted a sign at the entrance to the building... EXPERIENCED WINE TASTER NEEDED --POSITION STARTS IMMEDIATELY.

A retired veteran named ""Ace,"" drunk and with a ragged dirty look and smelling of last night's rounds, strolled by the building and saw the sign. He went into the building to apply for the position.

Aghast at his appearance, the director wondered how to send him away but, to be fair, he gave him a glass of wine to taste. The old fellow held the glass up to his left eye, tilted his head toward incoming sunlight and studied the contents looking through the glass.

He then took a sip and said, ""It's a Southern California Muscat , three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers.

Somewhat low-grade but acceptable.""

""That's correct,"" said the boss. Glancing at his assistant he said...""Another one, please.""

The old Navy pilot took the goblet, full of a deep red liquid, stuck his nose into the glass, sniffed deeply and took a long slow sip....rolling his eyeballs in a circle, he then looked at the director and said... ""It's a Cabernet Sauvignon, eight years old, south-western slope, oak barrels, matured at eight degrees. Requires three more years for the finest results.""

""Absolutely correct. A third glass,"" said the director.

Receiving another glass, again, the Navy pilot eyed the crystal, took in a little bit of the aroma and sipped very softly... ''It's a pinot blanc champagne, very high grade and exclusive,'' said the pilot calmly.

The director was astonished and winked at his assistant to suggest something.

She left the room and came back in with a wine glass half-full of urine.

The old Navy pilot eyed it suspiciously... a color he could not quite recall .

He took a sip, swishing it over his tongue and across his teeth, musing upward all the while.

""It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant, and if I don't get the job, I'll name the father.""

Worry not though, as it turned out Dave was mistaken for some guy named Rich.  
Back at home though, Dave was feeling the heat. Dave’s wife brought him to a strip club for his birthday, a present she felt he thoroughly deserved. But it turned out everyone knew Dave. And Dave’s wife wanted a divorce.

He was skeptical about hiring him since he didn't have any painting background; however, he appeared enthusiastic and told him that he really needed the job. At least his wife Lorrie-Jane, told him so.

He explained to Herb, that his work day would be to complete 2 miles of centerline on the road. He was set up with brushes and paint and his boss got him started.

After the first day, the supervisor was pleased to find that he'd painted 4 miles of road in his 8 hour shift, instead of the two expected of him. He told Herb, that he did an excellent job, and said how pleased he was with his progress.

On the second day, Herb completed painting just the 2 miles of road that was asked of him. His supervisor was surprised, because on the first day, he had completed twice as much work. But he didn't say anything, since 2 miles of road was the amount that the job required anyway. He decided to just accept it, and to look forward to the next day when he was sure that Herb would pick up the pace again.

On day 3, the supervisor was disappointed to learn that in his 8 hour shift, Herb completed painting only 1 mile of road. Herb was called to the supervisor's office and asked what was the problem.

""On your first day, you completed 4 miles of road, on your second day, 2 miles of road, and now on day 3, you were only able to complete 1 mile of road. What's the problem, Herb?""
""Well,"" Herb replied, ""I'll tell you watt is da problem dare boy, but I taught a smart man like you would figger it out fer yourself. Every day I got farder and farder away from da paint can.""

Due to the current financial situation caused by the slowdown of economy. Management has decided to implement a scheme to put workers of 40 years and above on early retirement. This scheme will be known as RAPE ( Retirement of Aged People Early).

Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to management to be considered for SHAFT scheme ( Special Help After Forced Termination).


Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under SCREW program ( Scheme Covering Retired Early Workers).

A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as management deems appropriate. Persons who have been RAPED could get AIDS ( Additional Income for Dependents &amp; Spouse) or HERPES ( Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance).


Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by the Management.

Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT ( Special High Intensity Training ) as possible. Management has always prided itself on the amount of SHIT it gives employees. Should you feel you do not receive enough SHIT, please bring this to the attention of your Supervisor, who has been trained to give you all the SHIT you can handle.


Sincerely,
Management",Management goals,35

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",A man is driving down a road,8

Frank hangs up the phone and drops the blocks he was carrying. Frank takes his car and drives home, smashes the door open runs in the living room and he sees his wife screaming butt naked while covering herself up. Frank notices a window open and peers through to see a man running half naked with his pants being pulled up his leg. So Frank grabs the biggest object he can find, a fridge, and tosses that thing out the window and instantly kills the half naked man but in the process Frank being so old that he is, he gets a heart attack and dies. 

So Franks soul gets put outside the pearly gates. He takes a number and he sits down. His number is 67. Now he sits there waiting for Saint Peter to call his number. All of a sudden.

Saint Peter “66”

Frank looks and sees it’s the man who was having sex with his wife.

The second scientist said “ I’ll have some H20 ... also.”, thus avoiding a subtle but dangerous misinterpretation.

The bartender said “ If you guys aren’t drinking alcohol, then I’ll have to charge you for the waters.”

The two scientists both thought about the possibility of making jokes about subatomic particles that would use the term charge in a different way than the bartender. Ultimately they decided not to risk it and ordered some hot wings which although not alcohol still satisfied the need for the establishment to generate income from customers. The bar was named De Cartes Horse, which might mean that geometry jokes would go over better than chemistry puns anyway.

The bartender, Ray, seethed as he placed the order with the cook/ bar back. He caressed the bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide next to his aluminum baseball bat and hoped he would get to use one of these things soon. Since they were hidden below the bar, he could touch them many times throughout the evening. He knew he needed help because his internal dialogue had stopped. He decided not to do anything different that day although he could feel his split brain pouting. 

Ray tried to think back to a time when he didn’t want to hurt others. Instead he only looked ahead, in one direction and slightly askew to where this would all end up. He couldn’t see an endpoint.

We apologise for the 4 day delay in takin' off, sadly this was unavoidable due to to the bad weather and happy hour at  Ó Ceallaighs' bar.

This is flight 367 to Shannon Airport, Landing at Shannon isn't guaranteed but we'll end up somewhere near I'm sure. If you're lucky we might even land near your home!

We have an excellent safety record in fact our standards are so high even hijackers don't dare fly with us!

I have great pleasure in letting you know that since the start of this year, over 50% of our passengers have reached their destinations. For the ones who didn't, our staff have maps to the nearest pubs and we had one for the roads but Kelly had a birthday last year and she wanted a hat.

Our seats are comfortable enough for you to have a nap, but not to sit on for long. If the engines are too loud, just let us know and we'll be happy to turn them off for you.

Unfortunately the in-flight movie is unavailable as Darragh forgot to record it last night, but if you look out the window you may see a pigeon.

On the off-chance you see any smoke in the cabin please don't panic - it's just the early warning system telling us theres an issue with the engines!

Now, please be seated and fasten your seat belts as we prepare for takeoff. For those who can't find a seat belt just hold on to the armrests as tight as you can, and for those who can't find a seat, a flight attendant will be happy to give you a stool.

I'm sorry but i won't be able to fly with you today as my wife has a wedding today but please make yourself at home and feel free to fly yourselves.

Thank you for choosing Irish Airways, we wish you a pleasant flight.",Irish Airways,9

Our story today takes place back in World War 2, the sequel. 

So one day, old Uncle Sam pointed to our friend, a man we'll Bubba, and said ""I want you!""
So Bubba, a good man he was, said ""alright."" And went and joined the army. 
The day comes when Bubba's finally gonna get deployed, so he gets in the back of the line to get his gun...

And he waits. 
And he waits. 
And. He. Waits...

Finally, Bubba gets up to the table, and the man there sighs and says ""Well I'm sorry, Bubba, we just ran out of guns!"" The mans looks to his left, then his right, then he leans in real close to Bubba and says ""But here's whatcha do!"" He makes his hand into a 'gun'. ""See? Just do this with your hand, aim up, and say 'bang-ity, bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!', okay?"" 
Bubba nods, and says ""alright."" And gets in line to get his bayonet. 

And he waits.
And he waits.
And... He waits!

Gets up to the table now, and the man there shakes his head as he lights a cigarette. He says ""Well I'm sorry, Bubba! We're fresh out of bayonets!"" He chuckles, and leans back in his chair. ""But here's whatcha do!"" He makes a 'gun' from one hand, and a 'knife' from the other, and puts them together. ""See? So when the enemy gets close, just point it at 'em and say ""stick-ity stick stick! Stick-ity stick stick!"" 
Bubba nods again and says ""alright."" And goes to meet up with his squadron. 

Out on the battlefield now, Bubba sees an enemy, a Nazi soldier, coming up on him. So, he gets out his 'gun', aims up, and says ""bang-ity bang bang!"" And the Nazi, well, he just falls down dead! 
Another one comes, and runs up real close to Bubba, so our friend attaches his 'bayonet' and goes 'stick-ity stick stick!"" As he pokes the the soldier... and he falls down dead right next to the other one.

This goes on for a good while, and Bubba racks up more kills than anyone... but, that's when things take a bit of a sour turn. 

A big, and mean *BIG* old blonde man, who we'll call Hässlich, starts running up to Bubba with a twisted smile on his ugly face.
Now, Bubba's about as *big* as you'd expect a country boy named Bubba to be; but old Hässlich made him look a house cat next to a lion.

Bubba aimed his 'gun' and said ""Bang-ity bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!"" But Hässlich didn't even slow down. Bubba, now white as the ghost of an albino, tried again. ""Bang-ity bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!"" Still didn't phase Hässlich in the slightest. 
Häs was getting closer now, so Bubba took out his 'bayonet' and went ""stick-ity stick stick! Stick-ity stick stick!"" Still nothing!

Bubba wouldve tried again, but Hässlich ran up and ran right *over* Bubba! Crushing, and sadly killing our friend in the process. 

And has he ran off into the distance, you could here old Hässlich saying ""TANK-ITY TANK TANK! TANK-ITY TANK TANK!""

The lawyer on the ground was most skeptical and said, ""I think you're hallucinating and you should come down right now.""

So, the lawyer reluctantly climbed down the tree and told his friend that he had just actually seen a naked blonde woman floating face up... headed toward their island. The other lawyer started to laugh, thinking his friend had surely lost his mind. But within a few minutes, up to their beach floated a naked blonde woman, face up, and totally unconscious.

The two lawyers went over to her and discovered, yes she was alive. One said to the other, ""You know, we've been on this island for months now without a woman. It's been a long time. Do you think we should, you know , screw her?""

ACETAMINOPHEN

All drugs have two names, a trade name and generic name.
Example, the trade name is Tylenol and its generic name is Acetaminophen... Aleve is also called Naproxen.
Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.
 
The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.
 
After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.
Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.
Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer..
It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.
 
Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of 'cocktails', 'highballs' and just a good old-fashioned 'stiff drink'.
Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.
Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.
This means that by 2020, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.",Clever joke,2

The cat replies, “My life was hard. I spent my days sleeping on a hard wooden floor, chasing my food all my days. May I have a pillow so I can spend my days in heaven in comfort?” St Peter obliges and the cat takes his well deserved rest. 

A few days later, three mice show up. St Peter also permits them into heaven and grants them a request. 

The mice tell St Peter, “We spent our whole lives running away from predators. Could we have some skates so we can get from place to place faster?” Skates suddenly appear on each of the mice’s feet and St Peter sends them on their way.

A few hours later, St Peter goes to check in on the cat.

“I just wanted to see how heaven has been for you so far. Has it been everything you hoped?”

“It’s been wonderful,” the cat replied. “I’ve not had to chase anything and I’ve been able to spend my days content, lazy, and comfortable. I’ve especially loved the meals on wheels you’ve been sending by, that’s the best part!”

After some time, one of them separated from the group to approach her. It was Doc.

“Good morning, Mother Sister. I mean Mother Superior. Really sorry to bother you, but could you help us settle an argument?”

“Well, I shall try my best,” said the head nun.

“Mother Superior, do you have any nuns under your care at this convent that are three feet tall?”

Surprised at the question, the Mother Superior said, “No, I’m afraid we do not. We would have welcomed anyone of that height if they had asked, but no one of that description has even visited us here.”

“I see. Thank you very much, Mother Superior,” said Doc, and he went back to his group, and his arrival promptly reignited their argument.

The head nun ignored them and continued her work. She enjoyed a few minutes of concentration, when suddenly, a powerful sneeze, followed by a rain of falling leaves, caught her attention. It was Sneezy.

“Pardon my intrusion, Mother Superior. We’re having a discussion right now, and we’re hoping you could help us settle things,” he said, in between sneezes.

“Very well, what is it then?”

“Mother Superior, is there a nun here who is about three feet tall?”

Annoyed, the Mother Superior answered firmly, “No. Just as I told your friend earlier, we don’t have any nun with that height here. I may not be overly close to all of the nuns, but I know each and every one of those under my care here. None of them are of that height.”

“Ah, sorry then, Mother Superior. Thank you,” said Sneezy, and headed back to the group. The sounds of argument resumed.

By then, the Mother Superior was plenty irritated. The Bishop was scheduled to drop by later that day, and she still had so much to do. It didn’t help that all the nuns were daft to the last girl, leaving her to do everything, and if she had to deal with just ONE more silliness, she’d –

“Hey Sister.”

“WHAT THE HELL IS IT?” snarled Mother Superior.

“Whoa, whoa, calm down there, Sister,” said Grumpy. “You’re getting a tad grumpy.”

Her entire body shaking as she tried to control her temper and not do anything she would regret, the Mother Superior said, through gritted teeth, “What. Is. It.”

Grumpy raised his hand to the area in front of his forehead. “Sister, you got any nuns around this height-”

Almost spitting with rage, the Mother Superior said, “None! There are none! There never has been one, ever! And God forbid if one ever shows up, I will personally put her in a box and mail her to you. Good day!”

For a moment Grumpy looked as if he was about to ask the Mother Superior if she was sure, but then thought the better of it. He thanked the nun, and started plodding towards the group. He raised his hands, palms up, and shook his head.

Briefly, the dwarves were quiet, and then six of them started to laugh like maniacs, with some dancing. The Mother Superior threw them her sharpest look, but they were too busy to notice her. Six of them were chanting, “Dopey fucked a penguin, Dopey fucked a penguin.”","One day, a Mother Superior was attending to some matters just outside the main doors of her convent.

It is late in the night, and everyone is lying on the floor, covered by blankets of all sorts, those provided in the shelter as well as any that some people have brought in on their person.

In one corner of the shelter, there are two men, Jack and Mike, secretly a gay couple. Jack gets rather horny throughout the night and confesses to his partner that he'd love to have intercourse with him, and right now at that.

Mike hisses back, ""Are you bleeding crazy? People will see us!""

Jack replies, ""No, no, they're all asleep. Look."" He rises up and asks loudly, ""Can anyone please spare an extra blanket for me?"". No answer. Laying back down, he says ""See, Mike? No issues."".

So they go on with their 'business'. In the morning, someone finds an old man, who is trembling and not feeling well. After people manage to find out from him what's wrong, it turns out it was too cold for him that night. Someone asks him why he didn't ask for an extra blanket.

He knocks on the farmhouse door, the farmer opens it and invites him in. After picking out a box of a dozen eggs, the man caught a glimpse of a golden shine coming through a slightly opened door to his left. The man asks the farmer about the light and is taken aback when the farmer hurries over to the door and closes it. The farmer then says quickly that there is nothing important behind the door and goes back to selling eggs to the man before ushering him out of the front door.

The man goes home but curiosity gets the better of him and he breaks into the farmhouse that same night. After reaching the strange door, he slowly creaks it open and his jaw drops to the floor. The most beautiful and intricate throne sits in the centre of the room. A solid gold seat encrusted with gems polished to sparkle like stars. On this throne, to the surprise of the man, was just a one legged chicken.

A crash came from behind him as the man hears the farmers voice calling,

‘Get out whoever you are, I’m armed and dangerous’

The man swings around and is face to face with a shotgun barrel.

‘Please sir, don’t shoot’ says the man. ‘I was only curious about what was in this room. Why does this chicken have such a nice throne in a room if it’s own?’

The farmer lowers his shotgun and says to the man, ‘well this is no ordinary chicken you see. This is the most incredible chicken in the world. This chicken can walk around the house, cooking food, washing the dishes, cleaning my clothes, feeding the other chickens, collecting the eggs, raising the little chicks, it handles all of my finances, babysits for my children, repair all of my farm equipment. You name it he does it. Hell he even lays golden eggs and has saved my farm from bankruptcy many times. I keep him protected in this room because he’s so valuable.’

The man is astonished. He is lost for words and just stared at this chicken in awe. After a few moments the man comes to his senses, looks at the farmer and asks,

‘But why does he only have one leg? was there a terrible accident or maybe jealous farmers trying to kidnap him? The poor creature, how could this happen?’

The farmer then replies, ‘well a chicken this good? You can’t just eat both legs, can you?’",A man visits a chicken farm.,11

They are at the gates of heaven, when St. Peter says to them, “I’m sorry, but there’s been some mistake. You three aren’t supposed to be here, you’re supposed to be in hell.”

Begging and pleading, they ask for one more chance. St. Peter says, “Fine, I’ll give you each one more chance.” Looking at the gay guy, he says, “You need to stop lusting after men.” To the fat guy, he says, “You need to stop being a glutton.” And to the gambler, “You need to quit gambling.”

“If any of you do these things again, even once, it’ll be straight to hell.”

And POOF! They were back on earth. 

They were walking down a sidewalk when they began passing a really fine restaurant. The smells emanating from it were too much for the fat guy to handle. Not able to help it any longer, he runs towards the entrance, and as soon as his hand touches the door handle, POOF! He was gone. 

The other two continued walking down the sidewalk, when they came across a very shiny gold coin laying on the ground. The gambler bent over to pick it up, and POOF! The gay guy was gone. ","A gay guy, a fat guy, and a gambler.",173

He asks him for advice on getting to the top, and the man replies “Godspeed.” He makes another plea for guidance as they pass one another, and the man responds “Godspeed, my friend,” and continues his descent.

Frustrated with the lack of help, he continues the long and arduous climb. After many hard days, he can finally see the summit.

As he begins the summit climb, the rock face becomes very wet and slippery. He is doing all he can not to fall off, when he notices a strong and foul scent. The smell is too unbearable and the rock face too slippery to continue.

Defeated, the man makes his way down, figuring he will rest and try again later. Unable to find a suitable resting spot, he is forced to climb all the way back to the bottom. After days of climbing down, he gets back to the bottom where he sees the same man, sitting on a rock.

He approaches him and angrily says “hey thanks for the help before..

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

Dr 2: ""Unfortunately I would agree with the previous assessment, we have no choice but to remove your testicles"".

However as luck would have it a kiwi doctor just so happens to be there! The kiwi explains his troubles to the doctor and the doctor agrees to give him a quick inspection in the back alley. 

After a brief look the kiwi dr says: ""Awww sorry bru, your nuts are cooked! We're gonna need to chop them off!""

No one answered until little Mary stood up and said, ""You should not be asking sixth-graders a question like that! I'm going to tell my parents, and they will go and tell the principal, who will then fire you!""

Mrs. Parks ignored her and asked the question again, ""Which body part increases to 10 times its size when stimulated?""

Little Mary's mouth fell open. Then she said to those around her, ""Boy, is she going to get in big trouble!""

The teacher continued to ignore her and said to the class, ""Anybody?""

Finally, Billy stood up, looked around nervously, and said, ""The body part that increases 10 times its size when stimulated is the pupil of the eye.""

Mrs. Parks said, ""Very good, Billy,"" then turned to Mary and continued. ""As for you, young lady, I have three things to say: One, you have a dirty mind. Two, you didn't read your homework. And three, one day you are going to be very, very disappointed.""",The 6th grade science teacher...,772

Knowing he had no chance escaping the tiger, he rushed over to a nearby pile of old bones. As the tiger approached ready to devour him for breakfast, the dog turned its back to the tiger, resiliently stuck a big bone in its mouth and said loudly: ""Yum, this tiger was absolutely delicious, I wonder if there are any more tasty tigers around here"". The tiger hearing this pumped his brakes, turned around and ran back scared into the woods. 

 A monkey who sat on the tree branch above and saw everything, decided it was a good opportunity for him to make things good with the tiger. He chased the tiger and stopped it. He told the tiger what the dog had done and how he'd made a fool out of him. ""Oh yeah?"" said the angry tiger, ""I'll show that little piece of shit dog what happens to those who dare to mess around with me. Hop on my back monkey let's go get that dog!""

The dog, still shaken from the previous incident, saw the tiger running towards him at full speed this time with a monkey on its back. Instead of running away, the dog decided to sit with his back to his attackers and seconds before the tiger reached him, said out loud, ""Where is that annoying monkey? I told him what would happen to him if he didn't bring me another tiger ...""
