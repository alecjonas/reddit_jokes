When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable.

When she went to tell Edna the news she said, 'Edna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged, since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of the person you love... I have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness.

The bad news is, Ralph hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead.'

Johnny started praying in a very low and indiscernible pattern. Mumbling and unintelligible, nearly under his breath. Mother looked at father thru one open eye, then at her daughter as Johnny continued to go on and on and on, when finally, Suzy leaned over and whispered to Johnny, ""I didn't know you were religious?"" .....Johnny whispered in return, ""I didn't know your dad was a pharmacist!""",The big date,42

&gt; 
&gt; This is Alan next door. I am sorry buddy, but I have a confession to make to you. I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can’t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing. The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. I promise that it won't happen again. Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Alan. 

John, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, stomped next door and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone where he saw he had a subsequent message from his neighbor. 

&gt; Hi John, 
&gt; 
&gt; This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the slight typo on my last text. I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you noticed that my smart phone’s Autocorrect feature changed “Wi-Fi” to ""Wife”. Technology eh?? Hope you got a chuckle from that.

""Nothing, sir"", the man replied.

But she is no ordinary prostitute, she is a stunning woman and extremely skilled in her trade. For years there hasn't been a single day she has taken off. Almost every man in the town has visited her which makes it impossible for her to find a suitor. She decides to go to a new place and start afresh. She moves to the country where nobody knows her and meets this fine gentleman who instantly falls for her. She falls in love with him as well. Now he is a devout Catholic so she feels it is best to hide her past and instead tells him that she is a virgin and she's saving herself for her future husband. He is very impressed with her and finally they decide to get married. 
On their first night together, she acts very shy as if this was her first time. The husband gets an instant boner as he sees naked for the first time. Quickly he gets on top of her and enters her.

Now, he's set to get a lot of money from his father, so rather than taking the standard first wish for money he thinks about it a little and decides that there is no way he would possibly regret wishing to be more intelligent than anyone else in the world, because then he'd also be in an informed position to make the other wishes.

So he does that, and is immediately overcome by problems he didn't know existed. Where he once had strong opinions, he is now in total conflict with points from both sides. It doesn't seem like it's possible to solve anything that's wrong with the world. The man can't deal with it, so his next wish is to be stupider than anybody else in the world. That way, everything will seem extremely one-sided and linear, and he will have no unsolvable problems in life from his perspective. He could live in an oblivious bliss.

After the wish, he stands there, staring blankly for a few minutes, until the genie reminds him he has another wish left to make. Surprised, he stands there for some time thinking about what it should be. Eventually, he makes his decision, and speaks slowly and simply;

This is Alan next door.  I am sorry buddy, but I have a confession to make to you.  I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can’t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.  The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around.  In fact, probably more than you. 

 I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me.  I promise that it won't happen again.  Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.

 Regards, Alan.

 

The Actions:

 John, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, stomped next door and shot his neighbor dead.  He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa.  He took out his phone where he saw he had a subsequent message from his neighbor.

 

The Second Message:

 Hi John, 

This is Alan next door again.  Sorry about the slight typo on my last text.  I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you noticed that my smart phone’s Autocorrect feature changed “Wi-Fi” to ""Wife”.  Technology eh??  Hope you got a chuckle from that.

He  took the box back home, found a good spot for  the box, and decided he would start off by  taking his new pet to church with  him.

So  he asked the centipede in  the box, ""Would  you like to go to church with me today? We  will have a good time.""

But  there was no answer from  his new pet.

This  bothered him a bit, but he waited a few  minutes and then asked  again, ""How  about going to church with  me and receive  blessings?""

But  again, there was no answer from his new  friend and pet. So he waited a few minutes  more, thinking about the  situation.

The  guy decided to invite the centipede one  last time.

This  time he put his face up against the  centipede's house and  shouted, ""Hey,  in there! Would you like to  go  to church  with me  and  learn about God?"".....

""You must all pass a test of purity. Each one of you will attach this bell with a string to your penis. Then you must walk into a room filled with naked women, and if I hear a ding within five minutes, it shows me you are not pure enough to enter heaven and will be sent to hell.""

The first man, completely naked and with a bell strung to his penis, enters the room filled with naked women. The moment he enters the room, he starts sweating with nervousness, and not even 30 seconds pass by...

""Ding Ding Ding""

St. Peter tells the poor soul,

""I am sorry but you have failed the test of purity. Go into the nearby shower room and cleanse yourself.""

The second man, also completely naked with a bell strung to his penis, enters the room filled with naked women. The man begins to sweat and tries his best to resist his urges, but sure enough after two minutes...

""Ding Ding Ding""

St. Peter tells the man,

""I'm sorry, but you have failed this test of purity. Please go into the shower room nearby with the previous man and cleanse yourself.""

It is now the third man's turn to take the test. Completely naked and with bell strung to his penis, he enters the room, not knowing what to expect. St. Peter listens intently for the bell to ding, but after five minutes of staying in the room, no ding is heard. The man walks out of the room, clearly exhausted by the test. St. Peter joyfully tells the man, 

""You passed the test of purity! Heaven embraces you with open arms. Before I let you in, please join the other two in the shower room nearby - ""

""Well what I can tell you is that she stops at this graveyard everyday around 1-2am."" He says.

Upon hearing this the man hatches up a sacrilegious plan. He gets a sheet and cuts a few holes in it,then he buys a cheap Halloween store halo. He then camps out in the graveyard and awaits the nuns arrival.

1:20 rolls around and the nun arrives in the graveyard and begins prayer. At this moment the man springs out of the bushes and exclaims ""DEAR NUN IT IS I YOUR GOD!"" ""Dear heavens!"" She eeps. ""I ADORNED THIS EARTHLY FORM SOLELY TO RAVISH YOUR BODY"" ""Of course oh lord, but I most make but one request that you only enter in my nether area as to preserve my virginity"" she retorts. The man is both confused and excited by this and he continues with it until his plan reaches its full completion.

The two are laying upon the grass of the graveyard now and the man decides to finally reveal himself to the nun. ""Guess what nun!"" He shouts as he tears away the sheet. ""It's me the guy from the bus!"" The nun then stands up and takes off her cap. ""Guess what guy! It's me the bus driver!""",So a man falls in love with a nun on his neighborhood bus route...,0

“These are very special frogs.  I have trained them personally to give the best cunnilingus in the world.”

The lady was skeptical.  The owner continued.


“They have super long tongues and are just relentless down there.  Each frog has been trained for months.  All my frogs have a money back guarantee.  100% satisfaction or your money back!!”

""Money back guarantee, huh?""


The lady figured she had nothing to lose and bought a frog.  She took the frog home.  After a long bath, she laid on her bed, spread her legs and put the frog between her legs.  The frog just stood there staring at her.  She waited about 20 minutes but still nothing.  Pissed off, she took the frog and headed back to the sex shop.


She explained to the owner but he didn’t believe her.  “Try it again,” he said.  “Let me see exactly what you did.”


So she got up on his desk, took off her pants, spread her legs and placed the frog between her legs.  Again, nothing.  “See!”

""Gotta pay first.""

""Yeah, I can see my house all right. ""This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom"".

""Ha Ha, I can see she's naked!! Wait a minute, that's my neighbor in there with her......He's naked, too!!! The bitch!""

He turned to the hit man. “How much do you charge for a hit?""

""I'll do a flat rate, for you: One thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger.""

""Can you do two for me now?""

“Sure, what do you want?”

""First, shoot my wife; she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the mouth. Then the neighbor, he's supposed to be a friend of mine, so just shoot his dick off to teach him a lesson.""

The hit man took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a few minutes.

The pianist starts right in on the most beautiful piece the manager had ever heard, and by the time the pianist finished, the manager had tears in his eyes.

Afraid to ask, the manager asked what that one was called.  The pianist said it was one of the first songs he ever wrote, and it was called ""Suck my hairy white ass, you commie fuck!""

Clearly impressed with the skill of the pianist but fearful for the effect the song titles might have on his business the manager makes a deal with the player.

""I will hire you, and pay you with $100 bar tab per night and 5% of the door, but you're not allowed to tell anyone what your songs are called.""

The pianist agrees, just happy to have a gig.

So he's playing the first night, really enjoying himself, drinking for free and all of the patrons are enjoying the music as well.  At some point, very drunk, the pianist needs to go relieve himself so takes a break from playing.

When he returns from the bathroom, a beautiful woman approaches him and quietly asks him, ""Do you know your dick is out and everyone can see it?""

The mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 5 year old what he wants for breakfast.

'Shit mum, I don't know, I suppose I'll have some Fruit Loops '

WHACK...she spanks him

He flew out of his chair, tumbled across the kitchen floor, got up, and ran upstairs crying his eyes out.

She looked at the 3 year old and asked with a stern voice, 'And what do YOU want for breakfast, young man?'

'I don't know mum, but it won't be fucking Fruit Loops'

Sitting at a bar one day, over the course of a few drinks, he tells a man he meets about his problems.  Artie, as he is called, says that he feels bad for the man, and he is willing to kill his wife for only a dollar.  A little inebriated and in disbelief, the man hands the man a dollar and tells him sure.  If you can kill my wife for a dollar, then here is your payment upfront.  

A few days pass. Then a few weeks.  And soon the man forgets about the encounter, meanwhile he and his wife come to reconciliation.  Meanwhile, Artie is watching, stalking, waiting to make good on his contract.

One Sunday, the man and his wife are out grocery shopping at the nearby Kroger.  While in the produce section, the man tells his wife is going to find a bottle of wine for the evening.  The wife now alone, Artie sees his chance to make his move.  He innocently walks near her, and then suddenly wraps his hands around her throat.  Violently choking her to death.  

Just as she takes her last breath, the man comes back.  He yells at him to stop, tries to fight him off, but it is too late.  In anger, he tries to kill the psychopath, but he is soon overpowered and is killed also.  Unfortunately, just as he is dying, an unlucky witness stumbles onto the crime, and he too is quickly killed.

It is a gruesome scene, police come, and slowly the entire story unfolds as to what happened.  The next morning, the newspapers read: Sunday at Kroger, Artie Chokes Three for a Dollar In The Produce Section.","A man, desperate to get out of his marriage, wants to kill his wife.",205

Moses stepped up to take his shot and, like Jesus, his shot veered to the right and fell into the water. He parted the hazard and made a similarly impressive shot for an eagle.

He slowly approached the tee to make his shot. Like Moses and Jesus, the old man's shot veered right and plummeted towards the water hazard. But just before it hit the water a monstrous bass leaped up and grabbed the ball at the very same moment that an eagle swooped down and snatched the bass clean out of the air.

trial to him, he thought to himself that this

berry, he burst out in laughter and was

He travelled by limousine to each destination to give his speech. After two dozen engagements, the physicist and the limousine driver were having dinner before the next speech. The limousine driver commented that he'd heard the speech enough times, and that even though he didn't understand it, he felt as if he could deliver it word-for-word. So the physicist agreed to trade places and let him give the speech, and the physicist would sit in the back and wear the limousine driver's uniform. After giving the speech flawlessly, the limousine driver opened the floor for questions from the students (typically there were none). However, at this particular University there was a rather egotistical student who thought he was smart enough to compete mentally with the Nobel physicist. The question took 5 minutes to get out and would require a rather lengthy explanation and some complex calculus to answer. Without batting an eye, the limousine driver responded to the young student by saying, ""The answer to that question is so easy, I'll let my limousine driver, seated in the back, respond.""",Nobel award winning physicist and his limo driver,53

Everybody in the restaurant comes up and says hello to Ned. After everyone has greeted him, Bill and Ned sit down and begin to eat.

""Ned, you're pretty popular!"" says Bill. ""I'm the most popular man in the world,"" says Ned.

""Now Ned,"" says Bill, your pretty popular but you're not the most popular man in the world.""

""Oh yeah,"" Ned replies ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I'm friends with anybody you can name!""

""That so?"" answers Bill, ""How about the President of the United States?""

""Let's go!"" says Ned.

The two fly to Washington and knock on the front door of the White House. The president answers, ""Ned! How are you doing? I haven't seen you in ages!"" The three go play a round of golf and then leave.

""That was luck!"" says Bill, ""Two thousand says your not friends with the Queen of England!""

""Let's go!"" says Ned.

The two fly to Buckingham Palace and, sure enough, are greeted by the Queen. ''Hello Ned my boy! What have you been up to these days?"" They enter the palace and have some tea and leave.

Frustrated, Bill says, ""Double or nothing, you don't know the Pope!""

""Benny!"" says Ned, ""Let's go!""

When they get to the Vatican, Ned instructs Bill to wait outside and Ned will come out on the balcony with his arm around the Pope. After a while, a crowd gathers to hear the Pope speak. And as told by Ned, when the Pope came out, Ned's arm was wrapped around him. Ned looks down from the balcony and see's Bill passed out on the ground. He rushes down and wakes him up.

""Bill! Bill! Wake up!"" Bill opens his eyes and says,

""Ned. You're the most popular man in the world.""

""I told you that, Bill,"" says Ned, ""but you didn't faint when I knew the President! You didn't faint when I knew the Queen!""

""Well I was shocked that you knew the Pope,"" says Bill. ""But I just couldn't take it when the guy next to me tapped me on the shoulder and said ""Who's that up there with Ned?""

A teenage boy was delivering papers to an apartment building. While there, a stunning young woman came out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing only a robe. The boy smiled at the young woman and she started up a conversation with him. As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. 

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming."" 

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?"" 

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere. How can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?""
