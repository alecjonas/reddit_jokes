Her husband just laughs and brushes it off.

This goes on for months until Thanksgiving comes around and she is preparing the turkey. The woman gets this idea. Her husband is still sleeping so she grabs the turkey guts, runs up stairs, pulls the covers and off slowly and puts the turkey guts in his underwear.

She heads back down stairs and finishes the turkey. An hour later she hears the husband's earth shattering fart and then a scream. About 15 mins goes by before he comes down the stairs.

His soul arrives in Heaven and is met by St. Peter at the pearly gates.

“Welcome to Heaven,” says St. Peter. “Before you settle in, we want to honor your free will. What we’ll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one day in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.”

And with that St. Peter escorts the Democrat to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell.

The doors open and the Democrat finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends. Everyone is very happy and in fancy evening dress. They run to greet and hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had. They dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy and has a good time dancing and telling jokes.

The Democrat is having such a good time that before he realizes, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens where St. Peter is waiting for him.

St. Peter says, “Now it’s time to visit Heaven.” The Democrat joins a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. Before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

“Well then, you’ve spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.”

The Democrat reflects for a minute, then answers, “Well, I would never have thought it. I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell.”

So St. Peter escorts the Democrat to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. The doors of the elevator opens. The Democrat finds himself in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash. The Devil comes over to the Democrat and lays an arm on his neck.

“I don’t understand,” the Democrat stammers. “Yesterday I was here and there was a great golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a good time. Now all there is is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.”

The Devil looks at him, smiles, and says, “Of course! Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you get the results of when you voted for us!”",A Democrat dies and meets St. Peter at the Pearly Gates...,0

The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office. He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.

He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there. He watches the hours tick by. Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death. He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.

post,dubtyj,2qh72,jokes,false,1573394830,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dubtyj/shameless_selfrepost/,self.jokes,,"An elf courier walked through a dense, mystical forest

Carrying a sealed message from his king with only a map to show where to deliver it to

&amp;nbsp;


As he arrived at his destination, he could see movement in the huge, thousand-year old enchanted oak trees and decided to take a closer look

&amp;nbsp;


Upon inspection, he discovered that they were treants! He realised that he had been sent to deliver a message to the kingdom of sentient trees,

&amp;nbsp;


He stopped to ask them directions towards where he should hand in the letter, as he moved closer he realised they were working on a particularly strange looking tree with millions of tiny branches winding like coils.

&amp;nbsp;


“Ahem,” he began, “I’m sorry to bother you but I have been sent to deliver a message to your king, where can I find him?”

&amp;nbsp;


The two treants slowly turned around and looked upon him with suspicious eyes, however they soon relaxed as they realised the elf was alone and not armed.

&amp;nbsp;


“We have no king, only the Great Elder, you can carry onwards west until you find the tall ebony arches which signifies the Royal Halls.” One treant said, speaking softly and well-mannered, before him and his friend turned back to work on the mysterious tree.

&amp;nbsp;


Curious, the elf wished to learn more about what the treants were doing;

“What is it that you’re working on?” he asked,

&amp;nbsp;


Yet again, the treants slowly turned around before stating;
“This is the communication tree, it has magic infused within which can allow us to speak with our kind through it’s many branches, it is our job to send messages and keep it well-maintained.”

&amp;nbsp;


Satisfied, the elf thanked them for the information and carried on towards the Royal Halls.

&amp;nbsp;


Upon arrival, he was ushered into the Great Elder’s chambers, where he was met with darkness and a great silence.

&amp;nbsp;


Suddenly, a loud, booming voice echoed through the room;
“Who enters the Great Chamber?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf was rather spooked by the noise and slinked back before whimpering out the words “I am just a messenger from the elven kingdom,”

&amp;nbsp;


Out of the corner of the room, a giant tree with grey bark and ritualistic carvings slowly stepped into the dim light.

&amp;nbsp;


“I welcome you,” the treat said, a little more softly this time, “I apologise for any discomfort I may have caused you, for sometimes even I do not know the strength of my own voice.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf delivered the letter to the Elder and turned to leave, but was stopped by the Great Elder;

&amp;nbsp;


“Wait, before you go, I wish to apologise for scaring you, it was not my intention. Please, allow me,”

&amp;nbsp;


The treant gave the confused elf food and water before speaking again;

&amp;nbsp;


“I wish to talk to you, I am over a thousand years old and I do not get much company aside from other treants who come here only to worship me. Please, I am somewhat lonely, will you stay and chat with me?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf didn’t want to refuse an offer from the Great Elder - that would be insulting to the whole treant kingdom! So, he accepted, and the two sat for hours chatting about their lives, the elven and treant homes, the differences between their races and how the letter the elf had just delivered was a peace offering between the two kingdoms. 

&amp;nbsp;


However, it was clear that the Elder had very poor social skills, as he sounded and looked uncomfortable and sometimes had nothing to say.

&amp;nbsp;


To lighten the mood, the elf decided to tell a joke.

&amp;nbsp;


He said, “Why did the boar cross the footpath?”

&amp;nbsp;


After a few seconds of intense contemplation, the Elder replied “In order for the boar to cross the footpath, it would have had to have been close to the road, however they are skittish creatures and often do not wander into intelligent civilisation, so the probability of this occurrence would be so incredibly low that I have not considered it ever happening, and unfortunately I do not have an answer to this question.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf, dumbfounded, decided to carry on with the joke and say,
“To get to the other side!”

&amp;nbsp;


The Great Elder thought for an even longer duration, before finally replying,

“Yes, I suppose that is a plausible reason for movement.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf then realised that the treant had never heard a joke in it’s life! He decided to then teach the Elder how to tell jokes. He explained, in detail, the intricacies of humour to the Elder, who quietly listened with intent. 

&amp;nbsp;


Finally, the elf said, “I have taught you all I know, now I wish to see if I have been successful in my mentoring, please tell me a joke,”

&amp;nbsp;


The Elder steeled himself and thought precariously for 4 long minutes, the elf getting impatient, before finally beginning to speak.

&amp;nbsp;


“Why did the Griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf replied “I don’t know, why *did* the Griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&amp;nbsp;


The great treant then replied, in the most monotonous voice; “Because he thought that it was summertime instead of springtime!”

&amp;nbsp;


The Great Elder burst out laughing with the deepest and heartiest laugh imaginable.

&amp;nbsp;


“Do you understand? Because Griffins normally fly east in the springtime and south in the summertime, but this particular Griffin had mistaken springtime for summertime and flown south instead of east!”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf, not wanting to cause any insult, decided to laugh along with the Great One, however he did not feel like the Elder truly understood the concept of a joke.

&amp;nbsp;


Upon leaving the kingdom to return to his home, the elf found the first two treants he had seen on his journey, and wanted to thank them before making his return.

&amp;nbsp;


As he approached, he saw that they were still working on the magical tree used for the treant’s communications. This time it was twitching and lighting up, it seems the tree was working and the treants were sending messages.

&amp;nbsp;


“Hello, I thank you again for your directions, I have successfully delivered my letter and will be heading off shortly.”

&amp;nbsp;


The treants slowly turned around before waving him off before one treant said
“Watch out for the two-dimensional spiderlings, I heard that they are a real *plane* in the backside!” 

&amp;nbsp;


The elf laughed out loud, uncontrollably from the unexpected joke.

&amp;nbsp;


“You like that?” The other treant said, “I have one of my own, why did the necromancer’s skeletons flee the battle?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf smiled and waited for the punchline;


&amp;nbsp;


“Because they had no guts!”

&amp;nbsp;


Again the elf burst out laughing, even harder than the last time.

&amp;nbsp;


“Wow, you guys are great at telling jokes, much better than the Great Elder.” said the elf,

&amp;nbsp;


The treants replied; “Why of course, everybody knows the best jokes are always in the comm-ents!”",Shameless self-repost,42

In her mother’s bedroom she rips down the curtains, jumps on the bed and smashes some mirrors. She finally calms down enough to notice that a small secret drawer has popped open on her mother’s bed.

Inside, was a very well presented box containing the most magnificent looking dildo she’d ever seen with instructions reading, “The Great magic dildo. To use it, just say the words 'Great Magic Dildo' followed by where you want it to pleasure you. USE WITH CAUTION!”

""What have I got to lose, I need cheering up” the girl thinks. So, she lays down on her bed and says ""Great Magic Dildo, vagina."" The dildo immediately goes flying to her pussy, tears her underwear and rapidly penetrates her, making her cum harder than ever before.

Feeling majestic and much happier, the girl lies down on the floor holding the dildo in awe when suddenly, her ex-boyfriend comes barging in and says ""Hey listen, I want to talk to yo… what are you holding??""

""It’s a Great Magic Dildo""

Laughing, he says ""Yeah right, great magic dildo my ass.""","One day, a girl comes home crying, upset that her boyfriend had just dumped her.",118

We began by learning about animals. My teacher asked students what their favorite animal was and when it was my turn I said “Pink Flamingo”

The teacher began screaming and sent me to the principals office. “Why are you here son”, he asked. I told him how we sharing our favorite animals with the class and I said “Pink Flamingo”. He immediately suspended me and sent me home.

I ran into my house crying into my moms arms. “What’s wrong”, she asked. “Shouldn’t you be at school?” “I just told them my favorite animal was a pink flamingo!” I cried. My own mother kicked me out of the house on the spot.

So my 5 year old self wandered the streets begging for food. It’s been 15 years since then now and I still can’t get a job. Every time my interviewer asks why I’m on the streets, I tell them the story and they kick me out. 

One day a police officer finds me on the street and says, “Hey, if you don’t mind me asking, why are you living on the street.” I tell the story again. “I told them my favorite animal was a Pink Flamingo and my life has gone to hell ever since then.” “Yeah so what? What does a Pink Flamingo have to do with anything?” He said. “I have no idea, everyone’s always hated me for it though.” The police officer went across the street to the library to find an answer.

After hours and hours of research, the police officer finds the answer. Excited to tell me, he runs across the street. A car comes out of nowhere and kills him.

A man from Georgia, a man from Florida and a man from Hawaii. They float on a raft until they hit an island where they’re met by a tribe of fierce locals who despise outsiders. A member of tribe offers to translate for them so the chief can decide their fate. 

The men are brought before a large clearing at the edge of the village where the chief begins his sentencing. “In the field behind me our ancestors have grown all the fruit known to man. You are you to walk the field and pick your favorite fruit then return it to me” 

The men think wow this is a very simple punishment. “We shall gather the fruits of our native states to show the chief we miss home and just want to go back” says the man from Hawaii. The other two agree and all three set off into the field. Around 5 minutes later the man from Georgia appeared from the field and approached the chief holding a peach. “Chief I bring to you my native fruit. A gesture that I simply wish to return home” The chief with a smile tells the man to insert the fruit into his rectum and he will be given a canoe and allowed to leave. If he fails to insert the fruit he will be beheaded on the spot.

Instantly the man stuffs the peach into his rectum just before the man from Florida returns holding an orange. As the Florida man approaches he tells the chief “I have brought you the fruit from my native home simply to show you I miss home and would love to go back”. Again the chief explains the process and the man begins to hastily stuff the orange in his rectum. 

As he gets his pants down and puts the orange in his rectum he begins to laugh. Soon after the first man begins to laugh hysterically as well. Within 30 seconds both men are in tears from laughter. The chief asks the translator what these men are laughing at to which the translator says

“They said the man from Hawaii is looking for the pineapples”",A cruise ship wrecks in the middle of the ocean.,19

As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?"" Asks the replacement. ""And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

 When asked what the problem was, Sheila went into a passionate, painful tirade, listing every problem they had ever had in the 37 years they had been married. She went on and on and on: neglect, lack of intimacy, emptiness, loneliness, feeling unloved and unlovable, an entire laundry list of unmet needs she had endured over the course of their marriage. 

Finally, after allowing this to go on for a sufficient length of time, the therapist got up, walked around the desk and, after asking Sheila to stand and unbutton her blouse, he embraced her, put his hands on her breasts, nuzzled her nipples till they stood erect and kissed her passionately as her husband Barry watched with a raised eyebrow. Her face was deeply flushed and she panted softly.  Sheila shut up, buttoned up her blouse, and quietly sat down in a daze. 

The therapist turned to Barry and said, 'This is what your wife needs at least three times a week. Can you do this?' 

Barry thought for a moment and replied;  ""Well, I can drop her off here Mondays and Wednesdays, but on Fridays, I play golf.' Can you pick her up?""",(NSFW) Sheila and Barry...,6

“A hundred and thirty-one dollars!” The man was confused. 
“A hundred and thirty-one? Who gave you one dollar?”

On the way, J meets a bean dealer who offers magic beans in exchange for the cow, and J makes the trade. When J arrives home without any money, the mothers become angry because they have internalized the false teachings of capitalism. They throw the beans out of the window, and send J to bed without dinner.

J finds an enormous castle and sneaks in. Soon after, the castle's owner, a giant, returns home. J is triggered and retreats to a safe space, but it has definitely nothing to do with the giant's size, because J would never body-shame someone.

The man behind the counter asks him:

""How can I help you,sir?""

""Anything you like ,sir. We have crazy ones , we have the ones that tie you up, we have the ones that like to get tied up, we have the ones that scream a lot""

""What do you recommend?""

""I can see that you are very undecided. For you sir i have just the right one. She's very quiet,doesn't talk, you can do it with her however you like and she will be fine with it.""

""Ok perfect""

""But there's a catch. While you are in her room do not open the lights. that's how she likes it. You should not turn on the lights under no circumstance ""

""I guess I can do that""

""Ok then , Let me just call Bob, the guard , to escort you to her room. HEY BOB! come escort this gentleman to room 40""

The guard escorts the man to the door and reminds him that he is not allowed to open the lights.The man goes in the room. After about a hour he goes back to the man at the office.

""How was the service ,sir?""

""It was great, the girl is amazing , she stayed exactly how i wanted , she didn't move, she didn't say a thing, it was perfect""

""I must say i am a bit distraught""

""Why is that?. Did she say something to you?""

""Well.. as i was leaving the room the light from the hallway entered and I say a bit of her face. And i think I saw a tear running down her cheek. Are you keeping her here against her will?""

""No ,sir, how can you make such allegations? Did she speak to you? Did she say something to you?""

""No. It's just that i saw her a bit and I am worried for her""

""Relax sir there is nothing to worry about""

""Are you sure?""

""Yes , everything is fine""

The barkeep comes over to them and asks, ""What can I serve you gentlemen?""

One of them says to the barkeep, ""I'll bet you a pitcher of your finest beer that I can lick my eye.""

The barkeep says, ""I've had guys come in here that could lick their nose but never have I ever seen one that could lick his eye. I'll take that bet.""

So the guy reaches up, pulls out his glass eye, licks it, and puts it back in his eye socket.
The barkeep says, ""Damn, you got me.""
He brings the guys a pitcher of beer and goes about tending the bar.

When that pitcher starts to get low the barkeep comes back and asks, ""Are you gentlemen ready for another?""
The same guy answers, ""I'll bet you another pitcher of your finest beer that I can bite my ear.""

The barkeep hesitates for a moment and looks at the guy's left ear, his right ear, and says, ""There's no way you've got an artificial ear. I'll take that bet.""

The guy reaches up, pulls out his false teeth, bites his ear with them, and puts them back in his mouth.
The barkeep says, ""Damn, you got me again.""
He brings the guys another pitcher of beer and goes about tending the bar.

A little later the betting guy is drunk, gets up and staggers over to the bar and lays a $100 bill on the bar saying, ""I'll bet you a hundred that I can pee and fill 10 shot glasses lined up on the bar with their rims touching without spilling a drop on the bar from 3 feet away.""
The barkeep says, ""It'll be worth $100 to see that so I bet you can't do it.""
He puts his own $100 on the bar, lines up 10 shot glasses and steps back.
The drunk whips it out and pees all over the shot glasses, the bar, and the floor.

The barkeep picks up the two $100 bills with a smile on his face, gets out his towel and starts to wipe it up. He then notices the drunk is smiling and says, ""I just made $100, you just LOST $100, why are you smiling??""

The drunk says, ""you see they guy over there I've been drinking with all this time?
I just bet him $1,000 that I could come over here, pee all over the bar, and that you'd wipe it up with a smile on your face.""
