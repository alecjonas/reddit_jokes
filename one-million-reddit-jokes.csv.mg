A black hearse was followed by a second black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one. Behind the second hearse was a solitary Italian man walking a dog on a leash. Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking in single file.

The Jewish man couldn't stand the curiosity. He respectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and said: ""I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian funeral like this. Whose funeral, is it?”

""My wife's.”

''What happened to her?”

""She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.”

He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?”

“My mother-in-law. She came to help my wife and the dog turned on her and killed her also.”

It was a very poignant and touching moment of Jewish and Italian brotherhood. Silence passed between the two men.

The Jewish man then asked ""Can I borrow the dog?”

After hours of gruelling labor, the doctor told George to gather friends and family, and pray to whatever god they believed in. After three hours of non-stop prayer the doctor pulled George away. 

The doctor told George he had good news and bad news. George decided to hear the good first. The doctor told him he had a healthy, living baby. George nervously asked what the bad news was. That is when the doctor dropped the bomb. His child was only a head. No limbs, and no torso. 

Geroge and Karen quickly decided it didn't matter. They loved their child. The child they worked so hard for. They took it home, hid it away from the public, raised, and homeschooled it. Twenty-one years later, after the child's birthday party, George decided enough was enough. He grabbed his child, tucked it under his arm like a football, and carried it to the bar. 

When they walked in they got a lot of weird looks, but George told his child not to worry, and carried it to the bar. After a few seconds of awkward silence the bartender asked them what they were having. Geroge ordered two beers. 

Since it was his child's birthday, he gave it the first drink. Carefully tipping the beer into its mouth. Suddenly a torso popped out! Everyone started screaming for more beer. After the second, the genitals appeared. George screamed that it was a boy, he had a son. Another and the boy had an arm, then another arm.

Two more and the boy had both legs too. A fully grown twenty-one year old man! Everyone cheered and screamed. George teared up as he called to tell his wife the good news. His son danced, and ran all around the bar, and out in the streets. That's when the bus hit him, killing the boy instantly.

The bartender looked at George and said, ""He should've quit while he was ahead.""",The sad tale of George and Karen.,6

So God agreed...... On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again...... On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.

When it was closing time the men started to leave and were thinking which route to take home. They decided that the fastest way was trough the swamp, because the main road was 10 miles and the swap route was only 5.

The bartender rushed to the men and warned them about the swamp.
Be carefoul there, i heard that swamp faggots roam around there.

The men laughed and took the swamp route anyway.

As they were walking along the pathway in the swamp they fell into an bog eye.

The men were in serious trouble as they sank and were waist deep in the bog. They started to yell help

In the mist they saw a man coming toward them. They shouted for help. As the man came closer they noticed that he was naked. As the man reached them the confused men asked him to pull them out of the bog.
I will help you on on condition he said.
If you suck my dick i will help you.
What the hell dude NO you fucking swamp faggot replied the men.
Well have fun drowning then the naked man said.

The men were now chest deep in the bog when they saw another man come closer. He was also naked.
The men pleaded once more for help.
I will help you if you let me fuck you in the ass, said the man
Get the hell away from us you swamp faggot the two men shouted
If you insist the naked man said as he walked away.

Now neck deep in the bog the men were desperate and would do anything to get out of the bog. Right as they were losing hope a third man came towards them. They shouted to the man that they would suck his dick and let him fuck them in the ass if he helped them.
The man came closer to them and looked them in the eye.
He then pushed both men all the way in the bog and drowned them.
As he begun to walk away he looked at the bog where he two men were and said
Fucking swamp faggots.",Two drunk men,10

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life for them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.
After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Falcons, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone. They blew a twenty eight to three lead. #Neverforget

I looked around and saw all the waiters had spoons in their pockets.
When the waiter came I inquired, ""Why do you place the spoon in your pocket?""
He explained,
""The boss hired Accenture Consulting to re-engineer our processes. They discovered the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. Approximately 3 spoons per table per hour are dropped. If our staff carry spoons, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""
As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare one.
""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.""
I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's zip. Looking around, I saw that all of the waiters had the same string hanging from their zips. I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, can you tell me why you have that string there ?""
Then the waiter lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. Accenture also suggested we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our manhood, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 45%.""
I asked quietly, ""After you get it out, how do you put it back ?""
He whispered, ''We use the spoon.""","[Long] Last Friday, I took a guest to a fancy restaurant.",36

Now I've only got two real friends, Ted and Cody. Trying to cheer me up and to ""quit being a pansy ass faggot"" as they put it.... they decided I needed to go to the bar. After turning down many of their advances to go out I finally obliged. All and all I had a great time we had drink after drink, I even danced with a couple cute girls. Fast forward to after we leave and get about 3 miles down the road to what we assumed was a DUI checkpoint. Now at this point Ted is too far gone to even try and act straight behind the wheel... Or was it Cody driving who knows I'm pretty fucked up at this point. Anyway we pull up to the checkpoint and the two officers tell us to pull off on the side street just past where they're set up. A female cop strolls up to the car gesturing to roll down the window. She says ""Alright boys this is a dick checkpoint. You guys gotta be at least 21 inches to pass."" Cody and Ted start grinning at one another as they willingly get out of the car to have their ""units"" inspected. Cody almost like a kid on Christmas couldn't wait and whips his out on the hood of the car and she replies ""11 inches"" with a smile on her face. Ted somewhat taken aback takes his out and she measures and says ""7 inches, only 3 more to go boys."" Unwillingly I stumble out of the back of the car as she eyes me up and down and says ""if you're anything like your friends I might just take you home."" So I take my cock out and she yells at the top of her lungs after she measures ""3 inches, you boys are good to go."" So we drive off and are on our merry way. At this point it's kind of awkward and silent in the car for the next mile or so. Until I tell them ""Hey you guys are lucky I was hard back there.""",Pulled Over By Cops [Long],2
post,73q0rf,2qh72,jokes,false,1506910146,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/73q0rf/long_but_worth_it/,self.jokes,,"I love Gummi Bears. They are God’s sweet nectar. What I did not know is that, like all things that are good in this world, they have an equally evil counterpart, the Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears. While I understand that balance is necessary in a morally mixed world, I had no idea how much horror evil could cause, especially one with such a happy, smiling bear-like face. Now, I know. This evil counterpart is clearly one of Lucifer’s sycophants, cleverly disguised in a childlike, gelatinous form.

It all started with a trip I was taking with my 6-year old son, to the beach. We were headed to the beach at Gulf Shores, from Texas on I-10. This is extremely important (and was extremely unfortunate). I drive two-seater pickup so he had to sit in the front with me on a kids seat that raises him up about 4 inches.

Anyhow, we’re in Louisiana when we come up to signs for the Atchafalaya Bridge where I force him to pee at a local gas station. it was beyond nasty, it looked like desperate truck drivers, homeless locals and swamp rats had desecrated and abandoned the place just long enough to create a smell that would make even cockroaches throw up in their mouths a little. My son fights me but I know that we’re about to cross one of the longest bridges in the world and there’s no place to stop.

Back on the road, he says, “I’m hungry daddy” and, being the cool dad, I pull out that sweet-faced poison. I immediately start shoveling them into my mouth without looking, assuming these are my regular friends. My son has one and grimaces. He must have noticed the lack of real sugar in his favorite snack. It's a hint I should have taken. Make all the jokes you want about hindsight. I’m not laughing.

The first sign came at about 5 miles onto the bridge when I felt a seemingly small bout of flatulence coming on. This is a bit embarrasing but As fathers are wont to do, I played one of my favorite father-son games I affectionately call, “pull my finger.” It’s a surefire winner with the boy every time. At this point, I’ve eaten my way through what I now estimate to be about a pound of the malevolent little creatures and they’re about to show their true faces.

I feel a few bubbles but disregard them. The pressure is building and the time for the game is now or never. I say the magic words “pull my finger.” Looking back, they seemed to come from my lips in ultra-slow motion, like a Robin Williams imitation. As I replay it, I try to stop myself but I can’t. My right finger is already extended and the knowing smile on his face is already there. He knows (or thinks he knows) what’s coming.

So he pulls on my finger and opens the door to hell.

The timing and irony could not have been more perfect as I release a long fluttering sound and smell that quickly fills the cab. “Daddy, that was gross. Is that the swamp or you?” He asks innocently. I glance into his watering eyes and realize he is serious. It hits my nose too and have to slam on the brakes to make sure I don’t hit the cars in front of me. I can no longer see them due to my own pungent stench, which has caused me to go momentarily blind.

Meanwhile, the farting has amazingly and inexplicably continued.

It’s getting worse and he begs me to stop but I can’t. I try to tuck my cheeks under and in but nothing helps. Then, the sound turns from farting to gurgling. I pull my hand away from the attempted tuck and my hands are moist. I feel my pants filling with a soggy warmth that seems to come from nowhere. My bowels have become the bowels of hell and nothing will abate them. I have no control of my bodily functions. The air-smell becomes the solid smell and I suddenly wish for the smell of the fart, because it smells like spring-fresh roses and clean linen compared to what now fills the cab. My son is in full cry mode now. The only thing that raises his terror level to red is the fact that my intense brown leakage has filled my jeans and has overflowed onto the seat, edging its way toward him. He cringes away and I can only look on helpless as it edges its way toward him like that only 50’s Blob movie. I’m still driving as I leak but I have to stick a leftover napkin in my nostrils so my eyes won’t water and I can see. Fortunately, he’s raised up by his kid’s seat.

Then I see sweet relief up ahead. The Atchafalaya Welcome Center. I jump out and run like one of those wind-up toy soldiers that have no knees and just bobble back and forth from toe to toe. Suddenly, all of those penguin comparisons you guys made in these reviews make perfect sense. I’m guessing that the back side of my jeans look something like an unwrapped Mr. Goodbar, but this is no time for pretense. I can feel the spray flickering from my socks as the chocolate pudding (or should I say puddling) - makes its way from the bottom of my jeans. I think I see the bathroom and run toward it in my toy soldier bounce, cheeks clinched, one arm covering my nose and face, the other attempting to squeeze my cheeks even further together, all the while thinking , “Why won’t it STOP!?”

Then I stop, because I see the worst sign ever. CLOSED. The whole place is closed for some kind of maintenance. Can’t they see that I NEED MAINTENANCE? I bang on the door and realize there’s no getting in. I see my son, who I virtually forgot, watching me from a smell-safe distance. I grab some local newspaper from a nearby stand and try to wipe myself off, making it worse. I grab the whole stack and walk toward the truck as I feel the cauldron start to bubble again. I wipe off the truck as best as possible and lay down newspaper, like a humiliated puppy. My son has no choice but to sit, carefully perched criss-cross applesauce (please, no applesauce jokes. This is my life, here) on his kids’ seat so that he doesn’t touch the crime scene. We start to head back the way we came.

I start to feel it coming on again and try to take a food inventory. “How could it still be coming out? There’s wasn’t that much food. The only thing in sight 10 miles and 2 blowouts later is that nasty gas station. I have no choice. I stop the car and go, tell my son to wait outside. This won’t be pretty. At this point, he’s numb, the snot from crying has thankfully clogged his nose.

I go into the hellish ruins of a bathroom and yank my pants down. Another blowout happens before I reach the pot, spraying the wall like a blood splatter episode of Dexter. The one noticeable difference is that, buried in that spray are slightly chewed, smiling, jello-from-hell gummy bears. You can laugh but it was as if they physically crawled their way through my digestive system to escape my anal cavity after wreaking the havoc that only they could cause

ByEmily Heseltineon January 25, 2014

It was my first deployment and I had been missing a lot of stuff from the states. I could get gummi bears at the PX here but not sugar free, and with the army weight regulations I try to keep my snacking healthy. Thus, when I saw a 5 lb bag of sugar free gummies I couldn't help but putting the order in. The gummies shipped in a varily fast manner and I was relieved to notice that non of the gummies appeared to have melted or been damaged in anyway. When I got the bag I was somewhat shocked, seeing for the first time how much 5 lbs of gummie bears actually is. I knew there would be no way for me to consume them all alone. Luckily, we had a range later that week. I stashed the gummies in my wall locker until the range.
--------------------------------------
On the day of the range, we all sat under some camo nets we had put up to protect us from the sun as we waited our turn too qualify. During this time, I broke out the gummies. Everyone was stoked. We all sat around chatting as we ate delicious soft squishy gummies washed down with Rawdatain water. So far, the range had been going smoothly. Soon it was my turn to fire. I was given range 3 and I immediately got into prone as this range starts off from the prone supported position. I adjusted my sand bags and that's when I realized something wasn't right.
---------------------------------------------
It start with just a gurgle and then a grimacing pain. I could hear the range control over the loud speaker ""Firers Prepare to fire-Lock and Load your weapons"" GURGLE- the noise was terrible the pain was horrifric. I tried to focus on the target by my vision started to blur and sweat poured into my shooting eye. All the while, ""Firers place your selector switch from safe to semi"". I could not longer feel my hands they had gone numb. I realized at that moment I had to go and I me GO. An then, ""Firers, at this time you may fire your weapons"". I didn't move my switch from saftey; even if my hands weren't numb, I wouldn't have trusted myself with a loaded weapon. Now, I had another problem. The range was hot! I heard firing around all around me. I weakly fumbled with my weapon and placed it in a safe position. The range safety came up to me. ""Soldier, is there something wrong"". The look I gave must have gave said it all. The safety waved his paddle and the call was made. ""Seize fire! Seize fire! Seize FIRE!"" I was up and looking for relief. Perhaps the other Soldiers stopped firing, buy my colon had just begun. I made rush to the porta johns to find they were all filled up. Of course, I had shared those gummies with at least 10 other troops. The noises coming out of those porta pots will cause PTSD for many years to come. I thought for a second about finding a place out of sight. However, it was futile, I was in the desert you could see for miles all around. Then I remember the nationals had a porta pot and likely no one else knew it was there. It was under the range control tower surrounded by a small fence.
-------------------------------------------------
I rushed, as quickly as possible in my condition, clenching my cheeks and praying to every god I had ever heard of. I made it and found it was unoccupied. I opened the door to find, in my dismay, an Eastern Toilet. I began to take all my gear off in a hurry. Whilst, small amounts of air slipped past my cheeks with a liquid like feel. ""Oh gods!"" I thought. I clenched tighter ripping my boots off I could tell I would need all my clothing off as this was likely to cause to cause an immense back splash.Finally, disrobed, I allowed the release....it was a clumpy tidal wave of destruction. The smell was nothing of this world. I tried not to vomit as my anus took on a will of it own expeling this sickness from my system. After, I looked down in horrior at the Eastern Toilet realizing there was no way that this was going to drain properly. I accepted defeat at my attempt to clean up the terrible smelly gummie soil and washed myself up with some baby wipes I so mercifully had in my ACU pocket. I put my clothes on and stumbled out of the toilet. As I walked, one of the natives walked by me. I tried to warn him, but he didn't understand. I only heard him cry out ""Allah"" as he slammed the door walking away from the porta pot looking at me with fear. The eyes telling it all. He couldn't understand how that could have come out of a human being without killing them.
In the end, 10 troops were given saline solution for dehydration from the terrible gummies. Our unit swore a vow of secrecy to never speak of this experience again with one another because of the back flashes that some still have.
Thanks Haribo

So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"" 

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky. ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. ""President Trump"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. ""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Dave.

Dad: Yes, son.

Son: Are we going to have a war with India?

Dad: Perhaps.

Son: Oh, goody. We will thrash them, right? Like we did in 1857!

Dad: It wasn't in 1857, son.

Son: Oh, okay. But whom did we thrash in 1857?

Dad: The British, son…

Son: And the Hindus too, right?

Dad: Well…

Son: Did Quaid-i-Azam fight in that war along with Muhammad bin Qasim and Imran Khan?

Dad: No, son. The Quaid and Imran were born much later and Muhammad bin Qasim died many years before.

Son: Then who ruled Pakistan in those days?

Dad: There was no Pakistan in those days, son.

Son: But there was always a Pakistan! It has been there for 5,000 years!

Dad: Who have you been talking to, son?

Son: No one. I've just been watching TV.

Dad: It figures.

Son: Daddy, why are all these people against us Arabs?

Dad: Arabs? But we aren't Arabs, son.

Son: Of course we are because our ancestors were Arabs!

Dad: No, son. Our ancestors were of the subcontinental stock.

Son: Sub-what?

Dad: Never mind. You seem to like wars, son.

Son: Yes. I like to watch them on TV.

Dad: But real wars are fought outside the TV, son.

Son: Really? How is that possible? What sort of a war is that?

Dad: Never mind.

Son: Daddy, you look worried.

Dad: Of course, I am, you little warmongering punk!

Son: Daddy! Why are you scolding me?

Dad: Because TV is talking rot and so are you!

Son: Daddy, are you supporting Hindus?

Dad: No!

Son: Daddy, have you become a kafir?

Dad: Keep quiet! No more TV for you! Go watch a movie on DVD or listen to a CD.

Son: Can't do that.

Dad: But we have so many DVDs and CDs, son.

Son: Not any more.

Dad: What do you mean?

Son: I burned them all.

Dad: What?!

Son: I burned them all.

Dad: I heard that! But why?

Son: They spread obscenity.

Dad: Oh, God. Son, go do your homework. What happened to that science project you were working on?

Son: It's almost complete.

Dad: Good boy. What are you making?

Son: A bomb.

Dad: What?!

Son: A bomb.

Dad: I heard that! But why?

Son: Because I am a true Muslim who hates America.

Dad: But only last week you wanted to go to Disney Land.

Son: That's different.

Dad: How come?

Son: Mickey Mouse is Muslim.

Dad: No, he isn't.

Son: Is so. He converted when he heard azaan on the moon.

Dad: On the moon?

Son: Yes. Because the earth is flat and…

Dad: What??

Son: The earth iss…

Dad: I heard that!

Son: Daddy, do you want to see my science project, or not?

Dad: Gosh, that bomb? But your science teacher will fail you.

Son: No, she won't.

Dad: Really?

Son: Yes. I plan to blow her up as well.

Dad: God, what is wrong with you? Go call your mother!

Son: She can't come.

Dad: Why not?

Son: I've locked her in the kitchen.

Dad: But what for?

Son: A woman's place is in the kitchen. I will not let her out until she covers herself up properly!

Dad: But she's your mother!

Son: She's also a woman!

Dad: So?

Son: So she should be hidden.

Dad: Hidden from whom?

Son: The whole world and Tony.

Dad: Tony?

Son: Yes, Tony.

Dad: But Tony's a cat.

Son: Yes. But he's male.

Dad: Son, have you gone mad?

Son: No. By the way, I've made sure Kitto starts covering up as well.

Dad: Kitto?

Son: Yes, Kittto.

Dad: But Kitto's a cat!

Son: Yes. But a female cat.

Dad: But she'll suffocate.

Son: Oh, she's already dead.

Dad: What?

Son: She's already dead.

Dad: I heard that! But how?

Son: I buried her alive.

Dad: You what?

Son: Yes. To avenge Tony's honour. But now I will behead Tony.

Dad: But why?

Son: To save mom's honour!

Dad: Oh, God!

Son: Don't say that. Always say Allah.

Dad: What's the difference?

Son: Daddy, do you want to be beheaded too?

Dad: No!

Son: Do you want to be stoned to death?

Dad: No!

Son: Do you want to be flogged?

Dad: No!

Son: Do you want to get your arms chopped off?

Dad: No!

Son: Then stop asking silly questions. By the way, I won't call you daddy anymore.

Dad: What will you call me then?

Son: Whatever that is Arabic for daddy.

Dad: I don't know any Arabic, son.

Son: That's because you are a kafir.

Dad: Who the heck are you to tell me who I am, you little fascist twit!

Son: What's a fascist?

Dad: An irrational, violent, self-righteous mad man!

Son: W... aaaaaaa...

Dad: Why are you crying?

Son: You scolded me.

Dad: Okay, I'm sorry. You have to be tolerant and rational, son. Now be a good boy and go read a book instead of watching TV.

Son: I have no books.

Dad: Of course, you do. I bought you so many books.

Son: I burned them.

Dad: What?

Son: I burned them.

Dad: But why?

Son: They were all in English.

Dad: So?

Son: It's a non-Muslim language!

Dad: But we are speaking English, aren't we?

Son: W... aaaaaaa…

Dad: What now?

Son: Zionists made me forget my Arabic.

Dad: But you never knew any Arabic, son.

Son: W... aaaa… yes, I did until you and mommy 

gave me the polio dropss… aaaaa…

Dad: Okay, tell me, can you do me a favour? 

Son: Sure, dad.

Dad: Can you blow up something for me?

Son: Oh, goody! Of course, dad. What should I blow? A CD shop, a hotel, a school...?

Dad: No, no, something a lot more sinister.

Son: Mom?

Dad: No, no…

Son: What then?

Dad: The TV set!

Son: What?

Guy 2: ""dude, what the hell is that for? At least with the money we did have, we could have bought a 12 pack or a cheap bottle of booze to share.""

Guy 1: ""Hear me out. We'll go to the bar, drink our fill, and when we're done, I'll put this sausage between my legs. You get down on your hands and knees, act like your sucking on it, and they'll surely kick us out and we won't have to pay!""

Get the hell out of here!"" And throws them out, without having to pay their bill. 

This goes on for 7 or 8 bars, well into the night. Finally, Guy 2 says ""dude, I've had enough. I'm totally shit faced, hammered drunk, and ready to go home.""

The man agrees to the job and goes to the top of the tower, 35 stories up. An hour passes and the man pushes the heavy bell with a resounding sound, but forgets to stand back. Sure enough, the bell came back and hit him, knocking him out the window and 35 stories down, where he died on impact.

A crowd gathers around the man, and say, ""Father, did you know this man?""

He replied, ""I never knew his name, but his face rings a bell.""

A few years later the man's brother came to the priest, in the same desperate conditions. He begged for a job, and the priest told him, ""I need someone to ring this bell, but since the rope is gone you'll need to push it. Be sure to step back so it doesn't knock you down as it swings.""

The brother thought for a moment, and agreed. He went up to the top of the tower, 35 stories up, and prepared to ring the bell. When the time came, he gave the bell a great shove, and tried to step back to avoid his brother's fate. But he lost his balance and couldn't recover in time, and sure enough, the bell knocked him out the window, down 35 stories where he died on the spot.

The people gathered around once again, saying, ""Father, do you know this man?""

He replied, ""I didn't know him, but he sure is a ringer for his brother.""",A man approaches a Catholic priest needing a job,5

Again she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated says "" fine, if you don't know the answer you give me $5.00 but if I don't know the answer then I'll give you $500.00""

This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to the torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.

The lawyer goes first ""What is the distance from earth to the moon?"" The blonde silently reaches into her purse and proceeds to pass the lawyer $5.00

""Ok"" says the lawyer ""Your turn."" The blonde turns to the lawyer and says ""what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"" The lawyer, puzzled, pulls out his laptop and checks all his references. Nothing. Frustrated, he emails all his friends and colleagues, to no avail. After an hour he wakes up the blonde, who had fallen asleep, and passes her $500.00. The blonde smiles, puts the money in her purse and falls back to sleep.

The lawyer, more than a little miffed, wakes up the blonde and ask her the answer. The blonde stares at him for a moment, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five and goes back to sleep.",A smart blonde joke.,37

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.


‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.


Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.


‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

He had just lost his job because of poor performance. His performance had been declining because his wife was leaving him and taking the kids. He basically was at rock bottom.

While walking through the city, he finally figured out what he was going to do. He was going to kill himself.

He decided to get incredibly drunk and party a little before ending his life. Wandering around a popular down town area, he noticed a pretty fancy looking bar that seemed extremely inviting.

As he walked up to the bar, he passed a beautiful red 2015 Bentley Continental. He had only heard about this cars online, since they where way out of his price range.

As he stepped up to the door and showed his ID to the bouncer, he was let into the bar. He walked up to the bar which had a few open spaces, and after getting the attention of a bartender, he placed his order.

After a hour of drinking, eventually the bartender noticed the man was having a ruff time. She started talking to him and he unloaded on her about what was going on in his life.

While they where talking, a lady wearing the most amazing form fitting red dress came down from stairs he had not noticed. Everybody in the bar seemed to stop and take a look as she sauntered over and took a empty seat at the edge of the bar.

After ogling the lady in red for a moment the bartender said with a smirk, ""I know what will cheer you up. Go talk to her. She can work magic unlike any other woman on this earth. Trust me, because of her I am here today.""

At that, the man thought to himself... well, what do I have to lose? I am going to just end my life later anyways...

Building up some courage, finally the man left his place and walked over to take a seat next to the lady in red. As he sad down next to her, she smiled and beamed at him in a way he had never been looked at before by his wife.

""Ummm... H-hello ma'am"", he managed to blurt out.

""Hello there sexy. Seems like you are troubled. Would you like me to relief some stress?"" she replied with a wink and a very enticing  and intimate look.

""Ummm, well, uhh.... What exactly do you have in mind?"" he replied.

She leaned over and whispered in his ear, ""For 10,000 dollars I will give you the best hand job you have ever received.""

""WHAT!"" the man exclaimed. ""You are a hooker? What the hell! I am not paying 10k for a fucking hand job.""

""Did you see that red 2015 Bentley Continental outside? I bought that with the money I have made on just my hand jobs.""

At this point the man was pretty drunk. He decided to go for it because, what the hell? He was going to kill himself later. It was pretty early in the day, so the banks would still be open at this point. He explained he would go grab the cash, and the lady in red offered to drive, so they hopped into her car and headed to the bank to grab cash.

After getting the 10k for his HJ, they parked back at the bar. The lady in red turned to the man and said, ""Well, what are you waiting for? Whip it out!"" she exclaimed, obviously excited about what was about to happen...

Within 3 mins, she had finished the job.

The man just chilled in the car seat, amazed at how awesome the HJ was. It was the best thing he had ever received in his life. Better than any sex he had ever had. With a new found look at life the man returned home after saying his goodbyes, and went to sleep. When he awoke the next day, he started pursing all the things he had wanted to do, but just never did....

1 year later, the man had really turned his life around. He had finalized his divorce and started a new company of his own that became a multi-million dollar company within a year. He was pondering about the lady in red one night, and decided to pay her a visit again.

He arrived at the bar and took a seat close to the stairwell the lady in red had came down. Not long after he arrived, the lady came down and sat next to him, and imminently remembered him. After chatting for a bit and having a drink or two, the man the went ahead and asked....

""Soo... uhh... I was just wondering, if there might be anything else you do?"" he asked.

""Well, I could give you a blow job if you like."" she replied.

""Hmm. Well, okay. If your BJ's are as good as your HJ's, then I am extremely excited for this."" he said eagerly thinking about what was about to happen.

She leaned over and whispered in his ear, ""Okay, well that will be 100,000 dollars.""

The man sat shocked, and exclaimed ""WHAT. 100k is WAY to much! I won't pay it no matter how awesome you are."" he said.

""Well, see this bar you are in? I bought it myself with the money I make from BJ's alone."" she said.

Mulling over the thought for a moment, the man decided that he would pay her the money since he had pleanty of it now thanks to his successful business. He left the bar and headed to the bank to withdraw the funds.

Arriving back at the bar he went over and handed the lady in red the 100k. She smiled, and grabbed him by the hand and took him upstairs to her private office.

They quickly got to business and the man did not last long at all. It was the most amazing experience he had ever had in his life. It was infinity better than the HJ he had received. He chatted for a bit and then left to head home.

A year later, his company goes global. The man is making billions of dollars at this point. He decides one day that he is going to go back and have sex with the lady in red. He heads to the bank and withdraws a million dollars, thinking that that had to be the price to have sex with her.

Arriving at the bar, he went strait up to her office and knocked on her door. She called out for him to enter, and when he did she was extremely happy to see him.

""Oh, welcome back! I have been watching you all over the news! It's great to see you doing so well!"" she exclaimed.

""Thank you. I owe it all to you. I also came on business, so to speak. I have 1 million dollars cash that I have brought with me so I can have sex with you. You are the most amazing women in the world, and I want to fuck our pretty little pussy.""

At that, the woman grabbed his hand and escorted him to her balcony over looking the city.

She gestured at the city showing him the whole area.

"" I would love to let you fuck me in the pussy. See this whole city?""

The many nodded eagerly. He knew this would be the most amazing thing ever.

""If I had a pussy, I would own this whole city.""

She is told, politely but coolly, that they are a very exclusive bank and have stringent requirements for prospective clients. ""I know,"" she says. ""May I see the manager, please?""

She is shown into the manager's office and repeats her request to be allowed to open an account, and the manager explains that they very rarely take new customers, and she would need to have at least a million pounds in investable assets, not including real estate. (r/theydidtheresearch) But she says that is not a problem as she has over a million pounds in cash on her, and hands over a briefcase.

While the manager delegates the task of counting the money to an underling, he asks how she comes by so much cash. ""Oh, I make bets,"" she says. ""For instance, I am willing to bet £50,000 that by lunchtime on Monday your testicles will have turned square.""

The manager, of course, takes the bet at once, and on learning that the briefcase did indeed hold over a million pounds, he gives his approval for her account to be opened. She bids him a good day and makes an appointment to see him again at noon the following Monday.

When she returns she is accompanied by a smartly dressed man, and explains to the manager that this is her lawyer, whom she has brought along as a witness. The bank manager smiles and says that he can understand this, but she is going to find she is out of luck. ""Well, maybe,"" she says, ""but considering the money involved, I'm sure you'll agree that I am entitled to put you to the test.""

She takes a large tablespoon from her handbag and says ""Be so kind as to drop your trousers and underpants, please,"" and when he does so she cups his scrotum in the tablespoon and sighs sorrowfully. Meanwhile however her lawyer has begun silently banging his head on the bank manager's desk.

""Oh dear,"" says the manager, a little patronisingly, ""I fear my learned friend is dismayed at your reckless gambling away of your wealth.""

Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used.


It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room.


In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch, and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another.


In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door.


In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in, and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it, and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit.


Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off.


A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful.


Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance.

The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. 


Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float, and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friends horror, the door began to crack.


With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried.


***BOOM!*** The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid , and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust.


The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""","Three young friends,",13
