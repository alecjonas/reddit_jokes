He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country.
 
As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.
 
I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight.  There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.
 
I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.
 
The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.
 
And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together.   When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full.

The dinner begins and pretty soon a man rises to his feet, gets everyone's attention and says ""32.""  
The room erupts in laughter and the man sits back down.  A while later, another comic rises at another table, the crowd quiets down to hear what he has to say, and he announces ""17"" and the place goes crazy with laughter.
This happens a few more times with assorted numbers killing the audience when finally the non-comic attendee leans over to his friend and asks, ""What the heck is going on?  What's so funny about numbers?""  The friend explains, ""We're all comedians here and we've all been in comedy so long, and all know the same jokes so well, that we've numbered them in order to save time.  So, now instead of telling a long, drawn-out joke with a setup and punchline, we just say the number of the joke we want to tell and everyone here knows it.""
The new guy thinks about this and thinks, this is great, I can say a number and make a whole room full of professional comedians laugh. I can't pass up this opportunity.  
After a reasonable lull, the new guy rises, clears this throat and says ""24.""  There is a stony silence and he sits back down.  He takes a drink and leans over to his friend and asks, ""what happened?!""

He says, ""Why don't you bring me some choices? Surprise me with a few things."" She walks away and rolls her eyes. 

She brings him some Coca-Cola. He rather lamely replies again, ""No thank you, I *GENERALLY* don't drink Coca-Cola."" He and his two buddies all start giggling again. She takes the Coke and walks back.

Now irate, she brings him a cup of coffee. As she places it in front of him, he blurts out, ""No thank you, I *GENERALLY* don't drink coffee!"" Once again, he and all his buddies burst out in laughter.

No longer holding back due to her respect for the servicemen, the waitress angrily asks, ""Just who do you think you think you are?"" 
The general reaches into his pocket and pulls out a business card and hands it to the waitress. He says, ""Just go back there again, you'll know what to bring me."" Still very upset as she walks back to the kitchen, she reads the man's business card.

They noticed a frail old man, sitting by his donkey in the hot sand, about a hundred meters away, and decided to ask him. ""Excuse me sir, do you have the time?"" The old man slowly nodded, turned towards his donkey, cupped the donkey's balls and lifted them slightly, about an inch. ""It's 2:16, sir."" The couple, astounded by what they had just seen, thanked the old man and went on their way, discussing about the odd event. 

Time passed, and the couple still couldn't figure out how the old man had done it. They made their way back to him, and asked him again. ""Excuse me sir, but do you have a watch?"", Adam asked. ""No, but I can tell you the time"", the old man replied. He once again turned to his donkey, cupped the balls and lifted them, as if weighing them, and turned back. ""It's currently 2:58."" Once again, the couple walked off, thanking the man, and discussed what they'd just seen. 

Nothing came of it, and they decided to go back one last time to the frail old man. ""Excuse me,"" Adam said, ""sorry to bother you again, but my wife and I were very curious as to how you could figure out the time of day simply by weighing your donkey's testicles."" The old man chuckled, ""You two aren't the first, but here sir, take a seat,"" as he got up from the hot sand. ""Cup the balls, sir,"" he instructed. ""Now lift them slightly, about an inch or so.""

He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely. He has had more experience, but it's the first time his finger has found the right place.

He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be.

He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him-he's done this many times before.

His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for an easy entrance. You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake your head and nod for him to go on. He begins going in and out with skill but you are now too numb to feel him within you.

After a few moments, you feel something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad to have it over. He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle; that you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.

You smile and thank your dentist. After all, it was your first time to have a tooth pulled.

post,4orya8,2qh72,jokes,false,1466311275,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4orya8/justin_trudeau_visits_church/,self.jokes,,"Last Saturday afternoon, in Edmonton an aide to PM Justin Trudeau visited the Cardinal of the Catholic cathedral in Edmonton. He told the Cardinal that PM Justin Trudeau would be attending the next mass, and he asked if the Cardinal would kindly point out Trudeau to the congregation and say a few words that would include calling Trudeau a saint.
 
The Cardinal replied, ""No. I don't really like the Man, and there are issues of conflict with the Catholic Church over certain of Trudeau's views.
Trudeau's aide then said, ""Look, I'll write a check here and now for a donation of $10,000 to your church if you'll just tell the congregation you see Trudeau as a saint."" The Cardinal thought about it and said, ""Well, the church can use the money, so I'll work your request into tomorrow's sermon.""

As Trudeau's aide promised, Trudeau appeared for the Sunday worship and seated himself prominently at the forward left side of the center aisle. As promised, at the start of his sermon, the Cardinal pointed out that Trudeau was present. The Cardinal went on to explain to the congregation, ""While PM Trudeau's presence is probably an honor to some, the man is not numbered among my personal favorite personages. Some of his views are contrary to tenets of the Church, and he tends to flip-flop on many other issues. Justin Trudeau is a petty, self-absorbed hypocrite, a thumb sucker and a nit-wit. Justin Trudeau is also a serial liar, a cheat, and a thief. I must say, Justin Trudeau is the worst example of a Catholic I have ever personally witnessed. He married for money and is using his wealth to lie to the Canadian people. He also has a reputation for shirking his MP
obligations, both In Edmonton and in Alberta. The man is simply not to be trusted.”

 The Cardinal concluded, ""But, when compared with Rachel Notley, Trudeau is a Saint.""",Justin Trudeau Visits church,4

She’s young, and destitute, and knows she can’t take care of them or provide for them, and after a bit of soul searching she makes the heartbreaking decision to give the two boys up for adoption. Over the years she kept track of the twins; one was adopted by a well-to-do family in Dubai. They named him Amahl; they own an exporting conglomerate and her son would never want for anything, and was given the best education a man could ever need, and access to resources that she could never dream of. The other twin was adopted by a family in Mexico who name him Juan. The family owns a lot of land and runs a huge produce operation that ships their products all around the globe.  As wrenching as that heartbreaking decision was years ago, she was relieved to know that her boys grew up to be healthy young men with all the life opportunities in front of them that she could in no way have provided. They’re living beautiful lives, and that thought provided her with some some small consolation over the years.

Fast forward 25 years later. The young girl is now a happily married woman... but there hasn’t been a day since she gave those boys up for adoption that she hasn’t thought of them.
And one day, she receives a letter from Juan. He had tracked her down and sent her a letter, and he included a recent picture of himself. He wrote that some day maybe he would try to visit. And she cried and cried and cried. She told her husband the story of the beautiful twin boys that she had given birth to such a long time ago; the story that she had hidden from him for all that time...the shame she felt, and the years of longing that only a heartbroken mother could know, or endure. She cried at how Juan had become such a handsome young man and how she wanted to see her other son to which her husband replied; “Honey, There’s no reason to; if you’ve seen Juan, you’ve seen Amahl"".","Loooong, but maybe worth it.",5

The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word “Timbuktu.”
The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem: 

“'Slowly across the desert sand 
Trekked the dusty caravan. 
Men on camels, two by two 
Destination -- Timbuktu.”
The audience went wild! How, they wondered if the redneck could top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited: 

“Tim and me, a-huntin' went. 
Met three whores in a pop-up tent.

""I'm going to kill Hitler when he was a child"" The professor responded.

Mark was both appalled and intrigued, so he asked the professor if he could tag along. The professor thought that was a splendid idea, so he booted up the time-machine and waited for Mark to join him.

A few seconds later they had arrived in a room with a person lying in wait to take the shot. He seemed unwilling to do so, for some reason. The professor walked up to the man and whispered uplifting words in his ear.

Mark could hear him take the shot.

Suddenly he realised that this wasn't Austria in the late 1800s. This was in Dallas, early 1960. The person he had who'd been shot wasn't Hitler, it was JFK. Mark broke down and cried, and when he looked up the professor and his time-machine was gone.

All of the most idiotic minds of the world pack into an auditorium, and watch the stage. Slowly the curtain rises on the stage, and the first person to identify the object is crowned ""Idiot of the Year"".

Back in 2014, the idiots convened in Paris. The auditorium was filled, the lights were dimmed, and the audience trembled with excitement. The curtain started to rise, slowly revealing the object!

Three wheels... A seat... Two pedals... Handlebars... When suddenly a member of the audience stood up and shouted, ""it's a tricycle!"" 

And the music began to play: ""du da du da duuuuuu da deer! You're the idiot of the year!"" 

Last year, the idiots convened in New York. The auditorium was filled, the lights were dimmed, and the audience slam it couldn't contain themselves. ""Last year it was a tricycle"", they said, ""what could it be possibly be this year?"" Then the curtain began to rise, slowly revealing 2015's object!

Two wheels... A seat... Two pedals... Handlebars... When suddenly a woman in the very back row stands up and shouts, ""It's a bicycle!"" 

And the music began to play: ""du da du da duuuuuu da deer! You're the idiot of the year!""

The Idiot of the Year convention for 2016 occurred quite recently actually. In the interests of allowing more idiots to attend the convention, the event would be hosted on reddit. The auditorium was filled, the lights were dimmed, and a dull roar issued forth from the audience. ""It was a tricycle two years ago,"" they said, ""and a bicycle last year. What could it possibly be this year?"" All this commotion was cut off, however, by the rising of the curtain to reveal this year's object!

Only one wheel... A seat... Two pedals... No handlebars... And suddenly someone stood up and shouted out, ""I know what it is! It's a... It's a uh... Shoot what's that thing, with only one wheel, and a seat?""

""What is it?"" ",The Idiot of the Year,4

That night at 11:50 pm the man remembers while walking by the porpoises that he has yet to feed them. He also realizes that he does not have enough time to run to the supply shed to feed them. So he comes up with a plan, he will grab some Mina birds from the cage and feed them to the porpoises, the only problem is the lion cage is between the Minas and the porpoises, and he does not have enough time to run around the lion pit. He decides then to run through the lion cage. He reaches the other side and grabs some Minas and starts heading back. About half way through the lion cage he sees a big light in the sky, a helicopter descends right in front of him and lands. Police pour out and put handcuffs on him and tell him he is under arrest.

As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.
As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. 

They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told the other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.
Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)",Mike and Muhammad,1079

One day the editor calls the reporter in and says, ""I don't know what to do about the next issue. There isn't a damn thing happening! No church bazaars, no school activities, and Sheriff hasn't arrested anyone in 3 weeks! I got nuthin' for the paper but a page and a half of ads! Can you think of any stories to write?"" The reporter told the editor there was a farmer with a pig out south of town, supposed to be a pretty special pig.  Well, that brightened up the editor, and he sent the reporter to get the whole scoop on the pig, write a big feature, and take lots of pictures! 
The reporter meets the farmer, who takes him out to the pen to meet the pig.  He is amazed to see a lovely large pig with a perfectly fashioned back prosthetic peg leg. As he is snapping off dozens of images, he knows this is a pig with a story!

 The farmer told him about how the pig, at only 8 months old had jumped down from the hay loft in the barn and saved their daughter who had fallen into the horse trough. ""Did the pig fall onto his hip or break his leg in the fall?"" ""Oh, no, she was fine! Then about a year after that,"" the farmer says, ""The wood stove caught our house on fire, middle of the night! That pig saved us! She got out of the pen, broke down the front door and woke us all up, helped us get out safely, then run a message to our neighbors to call the fire department! Saved the outbuildings and barns, she did!"" ""Did she get burned at all, or hurt in the fire?"" the reporter asked. ""No, she's a tough one, she was fine! 

Then just oh, bout a year ago, my son was riding out on the bluff there, when a snake spooked the horse. He was galloping towards the cliffs, out of control, when the pig jumped the pen, raced and caught up to the horse and got it turned at the last minute!! Killed that damn snake too, while she was trotting home. My wife saw the whole damn thing!"" The reporter is writing furiously, and asks, ""Did the snake bite the pig, or the horse happen to kick the pig?"" ""Oh, no, that's a tough gal right there, she was fine!""

 ""Well,"" says the reporter, ""I want to hear the story of how she lost her leg!"" The farmer scratches his head and says, ""When you got a pig this good, you don't want to eat it all at once!""

He was in his bedroom, listening to music. The specific piece he was listening to was a Bach fugue, Fuga ala 3 Voci. He was old and frail, and his heart wasn't that great. So when the music reached a climactic point, and then dropped off suddenly, he had a heart attack and died. His exact death was at the moment of a very long, sustained pause in the piece.

That measure of the piece is now known as Thoreau's Last Fermata.

After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.
Many years passed by like that.
At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.
With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:
- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:
- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.
A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:
- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:
- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:
- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.
- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:
- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:
- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.
- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:
- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.
- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!
- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:
- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:
- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?
- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.
The priest was good, and never told anyone.",The Priest and Half a Lemon,10

He spots a potential customer, and asks him to buy a chainsaw.

""Hey, sir! Would I be able to interest you in a chainsaw? That handsaw you are using will be left in the dust when you start using this.""

The man replies: ""Vell, I guess it vouldn't hurt, but I fink my handsaw vould be better in za long run.""

The businessman is not deterred. ""Sir, I promise you that this saw will revolutionize the way you cut logs. Feel free to try it out for a day, and if you really don't like it, I'll leave you be.""

So, the man takes the chainsaw, and the businessman leaves him to test it out.

The next morning, when the businessman comes back, the man tells him that it didn't work.

""This saw is garbage! My saw could do vay better than dis piece of junk, it takes nearly five times as long!""

The business man is surprised. ""Well, I guess maybe this one could have a defect. Please, try this one instead.""

The man gives him a new chainsaw, and goes on his way, hoping to sell more in the middle of town.

Later that night, the businessman comes back to check up on the man's progress.

""Dis vun is trash as vell!"" he says. ""The entire thing is vorthless!""

Astounded, the businessman takes it back. 

""Well,"" he says, ""I'll start it up, and see what's wrong with it.""

He fills it with gasoline, and pulls the cord, and saws through a nearby log with apparent ease.

Halfway through cutting it open, the man taps on his shoulder, yelling over the sound of the chainsaw.

He yells at the businessman, ""VUT DAT NOISE?!?""",Chainsaw,3

In the bushes near the river is a hunter, eating a sandwich. He thinks 'if the fly flies lower and the fish catches the fly, the bear will catch the fish and I can get close enough to the bear to shoot it.'

Behind the bushes is a tree with a hole in the ground. There is a mouse in front of it. He thinks ' if the fly flies lower and the fish catches the fly, the bear will catch the fish and eat it. The hunter will get close enough to shoot the bear and the breadcrumbs will fall on the ground and I can eat the breadcrumbs.'

In the tree is a cat.

He shut off the heat to the man’s room and instead turned on the air conditioner. Within seconds, the room was frozen solid, colder than anything the man had ever experienced during his time on Earth.

Confident he had finally gotten the best of the man, the devil walked away to take care of other matters. He returned several hours later only to find the man cheering wildly and dancing around.

The Irishman replies, 'Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America, the other in Australia, and I'm here in Dublin.

However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked, 'May I please use the restroom?' 

The bartender replied, 'OK, but I should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.' 

'Well, in that case, I'll just look the other way,' said the nun. 

So the bartender showed the nun to the back of the restaurant, a little later the lights went momentarily out, again!

After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place stood up to give the nun a loud round of applause!

She went to the bartender and said, 'Sir, I don't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?'

'Well, now they know you're one of us,' said the bartender, 'Would you like a drink?'

'No thank you, but, I still don't understand,' said the puzzled nun.

'You see,' laughed the bartender, 'every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue, the lights go out ...!!!! now ....how about that drink.....??????'

Anxious because he knows what might be the reason behind this call, he answers the phone, only to jump up some seconds later, breathlessly take his coat and hat, squeaking some excuses to his smiling boss, hastily making for the exit of his office building. He finds a cab, jumps in and tells the driver to hit it, right to St. Helens Hospital, where his wife was delivering their first baby.  
Arriving at the hospital, he runs to the front desk, gets his directions and jumps up the stairs to the maternity ward. Right as he is coming out of the stairwell, he sees a nurse coming out of the delivery room at the end of the corridor, with a tiny bundle in her arms.  
As he is immediately sure this must be his baby, he starts beaming and swiftly walking towards the nurse. Noticing him, she also puts on a radiant smile and casually breaks one of the baby's tiny arms.  
Rick stops mortified, not able to say anything, when the nurse again smiles her fantastic smile and starts twisting the small leg peeking out of the bundle. She continues to take the baby's head, acting as if she wanted to break the little's neck. Rick, coming back to his senses, starts running and screaming, only to see the nurse snap the thin neck while winking and smiling.  
""Oh my god, what on earth are you doing to my baby?!"", he screams in horror, ready to attack her, before she stops him with a contagious little laughter: ""April fool!"", she says, ""It was already dead.""",April fool!,14

He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. 

The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti spoke no Italian and the Pope spoke no Arabic, they agreed that it would be a ""silent"" debate. On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Mufti was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy. 

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God!  Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!"" 

Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. ""I haven't a clue,"" the Mufti said. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!"""" And then what?"" asked someone, ""Who knows?"" said the Mufti. ""He took out his lunch so I took out mine"". ","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all Muslims had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.",351

He is met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. The gates are closed however, as Forrest approaches the gatekeeper. St. Peter says, ""Well Forrest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you.  I must inform you that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance examination for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you need to pass before you can get into Heaven."" Forrest responds ""It shore is good to be here St.Peter. I was looking forward to this. Nobody ever told me about any entrance exam. Sure hope the test ain't too hard: life was a big enough test as it was."" St. Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know Forrest, but the test I have for you is only three questions.

1.What days of the week begin with the letter T?

\2. How many seconds are there in a year? 

\3.What is God's first name?""

 Forrest goes away to think the questions over.  He returns the next day and goes up to St. Peter to try to answer the exam questions. St. Peter waves him up and says, ""Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers."" 

Forrest says, ""Well, the first one - how many days of the week begin with the letter ""T""? Shucks, that one's easy. That'd be Today and Tomorrow."" The Saint's eyes open wide and he exclaims,  ""Forrest! That's not what I was thinking, but....you do have a point though, and I guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer. 

How about the next one?"" asks St.Peter. ""How many seconds in a year?"" ""Now that one's harder,"" says Forrest, ""But I thunk and thunk about that and I guess the only answer can be twelve."" Astounded St. Peter says,""Twelve!? Twelve!?  Forrest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?"" Forest says ""Shucks, there's gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second....."" ""Hold it,"" interrupts St. Peter. ""I see where you're going with this. And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind, but I'll give you credit for that one, too.""

 ""Let's go on with the next and final question. Can you tell me God's first name?"" 

Forrest replied, ""Andy."" 
""OK, OK,"" said a frustrated St.Peter, ""I guess I can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions, but just how in the world did you came up with the name Andy as the first name of God?"" ""That was the easiest one of all,"" 

Forrest replied  ""I learned it from the song..... 

""ANDY WALKS WITH ME, ANDY TALKS WITH ME, ANDY TELLS ME I AM HIS OWN""

As he's walking he comes up on a young boy, maybe 12 years old, crying on the edge of the dock. 

Mr. Smith hesitates but decides to ask what's wrong.

""Excuse me, Son? Why are you crying?"" He asks gently.

The boy wipes away his tears and replies, ""Oh, there's just a lot of things going wrong in my life right now. I'm sorry if I bothered you.""

Mr. Smith takes note of the boy's politeness, ""Is there anything I can do to help? Why don't you tell me what's going on...""

With that the boy breaks down and sobs. 

He starts going on and on about his troubles. 

His mother is dying of cancer and can't work. 

They can't afford the medicine to manage her symptoms. 

They haven't eaten in days. 

Not even an hour ago the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a restaurant for food and was caned by the owner. 

He tried to go home to his mother but when he got there he saw an eviction notice on the door and he just couldn't bring himself to go inside and give her the news. 

Everything was just falling apart and he couldn't take it.

 ""So I came here and just cried,"" he finished.

Mr. Smith was shocked. 

Of all the people he could have encountered he encountered this boy. 

He could solve this boy's problems with a single check. 

But Mr. Smith was a firm believer in earning what you got no matter what it was. 

As the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to the water...

""Son,"" Mr. Smith began, ""What's your name?""

""My name is Johnny."" The boy said.

""Johnny, you see that ship out there,"" he said gesturing to a ship about a mile out from the dock, ""I'll make you a deal. If you can swim out to that ship, climb up the mast and wave to me I will write you a check for one million dollars.""

Johnny was awestruck. ""You really mean it?""

""Absolutely."" Mr. Smith confirmed.

Johnny dove into the water without a word and swam like a madman. 

Mr. Smith watched with a smile on his face but his smile faded when Johnny turned around and came back. 

When Johnny reached the dock he explained he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn't make it.

""Well that's ok, Johnny. Tomorrow let's meet here, same time, and you can try again.""

The next day they met and Johnny tried but once again he got fatigued and had to turn back. 

Mr. Smith asked him if he'd eaten anything and Johnny told him he hadn't. 

With that, Mr. Smith gave him some money for a small meal and told him tomorrow was his last day in town so if he was going to succeed it had to be then.

The next day Mr. Smith arrived and Johnny was waiting at the dock with a smile on his face. ""You all fed and ready?"" Mr. Smith asked.

""Yes, Sir"" said Johnny. 

And Johnny dove into the water. 

This time he was swimming a bit slower. 

He seemed to be pacing himself.
Mr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further and his smile grew and grew. 

What a perfect end to a perfect trip. 

He was going to make a difference in this boy's life.

Johnny made it to the ship. 

Mr. Smith watched him climb up the mast. 

Johnny held on with one hand and reached the other out and started to wave victoriously but suddenly he lost his grip! 

Johnny slipped and fell from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below with a loud thud that echoed in the distance...

But Johnny was ok, know why?
