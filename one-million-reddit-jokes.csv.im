The problem?

It was missing.

In a panic, Sakurai searched the entire room, but he couldn't find it. Nintendo couldn't afford to lose something as critical as this. Within seconds, every member of the ship was up and about, searching for wherever the elusive Smash Ultimate cartridge could be.

Now with the entire staff of the ship searching, they covered as much ground as they could. They checked all the cabins, the restaurants, the control room, and everything else on the interior. As the sun was beginning to set, they finally moved outside. Before night came, they managed to search the entire starboard side. However, they still couldn't find the cartridge.

Many panicked phone calls went out. Nintendo couldn't afford to lose their big ticket for December. Everyone who was looking gathered to pool their knowledge, hoping that maybe somebody passed over it accidently without realizing.

They racked their brains over and over, but they could only compile a list of places they knew it wasn't. Despite all their hard labor, it must have been in the one spot they hadn't checked.

Of course, that meant its location had to be port.",Sakurai Brings the Beta Copy of Smash Ultimate on a Cruise,4

One day, about a year later, a few weeks before Peter's 18th birthday, Peter's dad approached Peter and asked him ""Peter, what would you like for your 18th birthday?""

To which Peter responded ""Dad, you know what I really want? All I want is China.""

Peter's dad was thilled! He was so happy that Peter finally asked for something besides pink ping pong balls! Peter's dad responded ""You want China? You got it!""

Then Peter continued ""and I want every factory in China to make nothing but pink ping pong balls!""

Peter's dad was baffled and said "" ohhh ok Peter. You got it I geuss...""

So Peter's 18th birthday came and Peter's dad got Peter China. Peter had every factory in China produce pink ping pong balls. Peter took every single pink ping pong ball up to his room and his dad never saw them again.

A few months after his birthday Peter was out with his friends. Under the influence, Peter made the vet poor decision to drive. Peter got in a very bad car crash and was transported to the nearest hospital under critical condition.

Peter's dad got a phone call from the hospital stating that he should hurry down to say his good byes.

Peter's dad arrived at the hospital and the nurse directed him to Peter's room and told him that he is fully conscious and only has a few minutes left.

Peter's dad entered the room and the both of them made the most of their time together. They talked about all the great memories they've held together.

They shared many heartfelt moments, eventually the pink ping pong balls got brought up.

Peter asked his father ""Hey dad, you want to know what I've been doing with all these pink ping pong balls?""

Peter's dad said ""sure Peter sure, what have you been doing with all these pink ping pong ball Peter?""

Peter responded "" Ok dad, with all those pink ping pong balls I ... I   have been... I...""

And just then, Peter died.",Peter and the Pink Ping Pong Balls,1

During his meal,his mother couldn't help but notice
how pretty his roommate was. She had long been
suspicious of a relationship between the two and this
had only made her more curious.
Over the course of the evening while watching the
two interact, she started to wonder If there's more
between him and his roommate.
Reading his mom's thought, his son volunteered, ""I
know what you must be thinking, but I assure you,
we are just roommates.""
About a week later, his roommate came to him
saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've
been unable to find the silver plate. You don't
suppose your mother took It, do you?
He said, ""Well I doubt it, but I'll email her just to be
Sure! He sat down and wrote,
Dear mom,
After your visit me, the silver plate has been missing.
""I'm not saying that you did take the silver plate from
my house, and I'm not saying that you didn't take it,
but the fact remains that it has been missing ever
since you were here for dinner.
Love, Your son.”
Several days later, he received an email from his
mother which read:

""Dear Son,
I'm not saying that you do sleep with your
roommate, and I'm not saying that you don't sleep
with her: but the fact remains that if she was sleeping
in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver
plate by now, under her pillow.
Love, Mom.""

He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador retriever sitting there.

""You talk?"" he asks.

""Sure do,” the Lab replies.

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says ""So, what's your story?""

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.

""I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.”

“After being the CIA’s spy, I was then approached by one of my colleagues who had recently gone into the world of Hollywood. He wanted me to be the secret weapon for his tv series, ‘Doggie Howser, MD’. Unfortunately, they decided to can me and hired that chump Kneel Patrick Harris because he could follow commands better than I could.“

“While in Hollywood, I met the love of my life Audrey Hepruff. She was the most beautiful gal I’d ever seen, with a beautiful brown coat of fur and her tail wagging ever so gently in the wind. When I saw her, I knew I needed to marry that bitch. Just as I was about to go up to ask for her number, a mail truck went by. She started chasing after it and was hit by a garbage truck.”

“After seeing this, I knew I had to get away from Hollywood. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

""Ten dollars,"" the guy says.

""Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap??""

""Because the dog's a damn liar. He never did any of that shit.""",Talking Dog for Sale,17

So the man traveled to the tallest mountain and lived there for 40 years, having visions and spiritual experiences until he knew the answer to the questions.

The man told him.

When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

The silence in the taxi was deafening....",My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theater.,432

""Fuck you"" says the man ""If you're a genie I piss tequila"" continuing home in a sullen mood he hands his wife his pay and goes to the restroom.

""Only one?"" she sadly remarks ""Don't I get to drink tonight?""

There's a neat little place called Uncle's Awa Club, where they hold a farmer's market, live music, food of all kinds... Right in the lava zone, very remote.

I'd read about one of the booths there, apparently they serve this really delicious boozy drink made with a whole mishmash of local fruits. Very popular; people go to the Awa Club just to get this drink. And also enjoy the live music of course.

We were leaving Hawaii the next day, and I still hadn't gone, and wanted to go that evening, but I was there with my family, and my wife had the car. The Awa Club was about 15 miles away (24 km). 

So I decided to walk. It was a sunny afternoon, pleasant weather, so a walk on the beach seemed reasonable. But after a few kilometres, the warm sun felt blisteringly hot. So I continued my walk through the water.

The cool water was a great relief, and I proceeded happily toward my goal, waves lapping my legs. I was making good time and distance, until I stepped on something sharp... Right through my sandal.

It hurt like hell! I lifted my foot, and there was a sea urchin stuck to the bottom. I hopped around, looking for a stick to knock it off with.

The beach was a desert around here, though; just black sand and lava rock, a few tufts of grass. But I did notice a piece of driftwood about 200m away.

I hobbled over on my heel, avoiding the water for fear of more urchins, and used the driftwood to lever the spiny creature off of my foot. Then I had to contend with the bleeding.

I probably should have turned back, but at this point I was committed. Looking forward to relieving my pain with some music, some food, and the famous cocktail I'd heard about.

So with the sun starting to sink in the sky I hobbled onward with still a few miles to go, trudging through sand and hot sun. I finally arrived at the Awa Club, parched and limping, aching for a drink. 

When I got there the bouncer saw I was a mess, but he took pity on me and let me in. I soon spotted the beverage booth, but it was as popular as advertised: the queue was enormous. I dejectedly joined it.

In line in front of me was a friendly local. She noticed how rough I was looking and asked if I was ok. I told her the whole story. She was shocked. ""You came all this way just for a drink?""

I nodded. ""Wow,"" she said. ""That was a long walk to the punch line."" ",A walk on the beach,11

post,92mdiu,2qh72,jokes,false,1532786952,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/92mdiu/one_sultry_sunday_afternoon_in_rome/,self.jokes,,"On one sultry Sunday afternoon in Rome, there was a beautiful young nun walking back home after the service in the church. The priest who was driving back home in his wagon spots the poor nun walking home in the sweltering heat. Being the gentleman that he was and a servant of the Lord, he stops by the nun and offers to drop her home in his wagon. The nun coyly refuses the first time to not bother the priest too much. However, on further insistence she obliges and hops on. 

The heat was quite unbearable. The nun slightly unbuttons her habit slightly exposing her well-endowed busom to cool off a bit. Naturally, this activity caught the priest's attention too and he was shuffling nervously in his driver's seat. He overcomes his inner inhibitions and places his hand on the knee of the young nun. The nun looks at the priest reassuringly and says 'Father, remember Luke 14:10'. The priest, embarrassed by this, gets back to his driving. Few minutes later, the nun is wiping the sweat off her temple and once again the attention of the priest is titillated. This time he slides his hand slight upwards on the nun's thigh. And true to word, the coy nun reminds the priest again of the Biblical verse. 'Father, remember Luke 14:10'. 'The flesh is weak, dear', sighs the priest apologetically. He recalls his duty as an agent of the Lord and pulls away once and for all. He drives on and with chivalry drops the nun at her doorstep.

Back at his home, he struggles to remember the words of the verse referred to by the young nun. So, he heads to his study and looks in his Bible - ""But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'""",One sultry Sunday afternoon in Rome,39

He was fairly good looking and friendly, but everytime he got in a relationship, girls would end up running away in fear when they saw how giant it was. 

After awhile he decided to go to the doctor, hoping there was something that could be done. The doctor takes a look and shakes his head. ""I'm sorry son, there's nothing I can do for you"". The man hangs his head in sadness, unsure of whether or not he'd ever be able to be in a serious relationship. He gets up to leave when the doctor stops him and says, ""I think I know someone that can help you though"".

The man perks up in excitement and listens closely. ""There's a magic bullfrog that is hidden deep within the forest. If you find him, he will grant you your desires. But there is a catch. He will only do the opposite of what you request.""

The man thanks the doctor profusely and immediately travels to the forest. After searching for hours, he finally finds the frog and approaches it slowly. ""Magic bullfrog,"" he says. ""Can you please give me a bigger dick?""

A second later the frog replies ""no"" and his penis shrinks about 6 inches. The man is ecstatic and sheds a tear in happiness. While he is very happy, he decides that it's still a bit too big. ""Magic bullfrog,"" he says. ""Can you please give me a bigger dick?"" 

""No,"" says the bullfrog and with a poof his dick shrinks another 6 inches. The man is even happier, but decides that just a little bit more will be perfect. ""Magic bullfrog! Can I PLEASE have a bigger dick?""

The bullfrog huffs angrily and yells, ""How many times do I have to fucking tell you? No, no, no, no, no!""",The magic bullfrog,4

He see one of the friends shout “13!” and then the rest of the group bursts out laughing. A bit later another in the group stifles laughter as he calls out “37!” and the crowd roars in laughter. One friend shoots back his liquor and says “62...” and again the group erupts in laughter. 

The new comer to the pub can’t contain his curiosity any longer and strolls over to the group. “What is with all the numbers and laughter?” he asks. 

“We’ve all been friends for years, and over the years, much like anyone visiting r/jokes, we kept hearing the same jokes over and over. So someone came up with the idea of numbering all of our regular jokes to save time.”

“Ahhh, I get it! ...do you think I could give it a try?” the man asks. And after getting nods of approval, he takes a chug of his beer, looks around the group and calls out “42!”

The only response was dead silence and awkward stares.

Not to be deterred, he tries again, “18!”

Now the group is going back to drinking...

“What’s going on? Did I do something wrong?” he inquires.

I never saw a version here that correctly attributed this to him.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years.

He eventually decides to go and see a Doctor.

The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for.

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As  he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new suit.'

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.'

The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years.'

Joe tried the shirt and it fitted perfectly.

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?'

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure.'

The salesman said, 'Let's see... size 36'.

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.'

The  salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a Headache.'",Joe goes to buy a new suit after surgery,338

Eventually, the ruler of the first kingdom decided that it wanted to control the whole lake. With his superior navy, he took control. In the generations to follow, his kingdom prospered. The second kingdom tried its best to help the first kingdom. It may not be in charge, but its people lived happy. The third kingdom rebelled, and after many long fights, it exhausted all its resources. The third kingdom finally surrendered, and for centuries it was lost in poverty.

Many generations later, the second kingdom decides it wants more. A formal declaration is sent to the first kingdom, in which the second kingdom claims the lake as its own. The third kingdom gets news of this, and it sends a letter to both of the other kingdoms. The third kingdom would take the lake, and as a result it would finally prosper. With this, all three kingdoms went to war.

To preserve the land in each kingdom, battle was to be done in an unsettled, neighboring land.  The first kingdom sends its 1,000 knights to the site of the battle. The second kingdom sends all its force, 100 knights in total, to the battle. The third kingdom sends its only knight, an old and weary man, to the battle. They all arrive in the evening, and agree to start the battle in the morning.

That evening, the knights from the first and second kingdoms drink and party, each knight boasting that he will be the one to slay the most adversaries in the battle to come. They laugh and make merry, while their squires clean their armor and prepare for the next day.

The elderly knight from the third kingdom is much too old to party, so he asks his young squire to make some dinner. The squire decides to make a stew, so he creates a fire to get it started. He then uses a noose to hang a pot high in the nearest tree, and gets to work cooking. The stew is served, and the elderly knight goes to sleep.

Come morning time, the knights that partied dealt with hangovers while they groggily tried to put on their armor. After some time, it was decided that none of the knights could fight that day. The elderly knight was already weary from his travel, and his fear of the upcoming battle caused a heart attacking during his sleep. Of the 1,101 knights that came to the battle, none could actually fight.

The three kings would not let the battle be delayed, so the squires were to fight in the place of the knights. Preparations were made, and the battle started when the sun was at its highest.

The battle was long, bloody, and brutal. Most of the squires were poorly trained, and few could fit into the armor they were given. The only squire with sufficient  training and a real set of armor was from the third kingdom. That one squire stood proud among a crowd of scared boys. Filled with fear, the squires from the first and second kingdoms agreed to work together to kill the third kingdom’s squire. It was one squire versus more than a thousand, and the fight was fair. After 12 hours of combat, the final squire laid down in the blood stained grass and succumbed to his wounds. No squire remained, and the battle was done. With their military forces incapacitated, diplomats were able to make plans and form a treaty between the three kingdoms. Thankful for the alliance during the battle, the first and second kingdoms agreed to merge, becoming one larger kingdom. Stories of the lone squire made the third kingdom a popular tourist and trade destination, and the kingdom grew to be quite rich. The two kingdoms took equal shares of the lake, and life was good for years to come.

This all goes to show that the sum of the squires of the first and second sides is equal to the squire of the high pot and noose.",Once upon a time there were three kingdoms.,100

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

""Are you kidding me?"" The bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?""

""HE'S ON TO US"" mathematician #1 screeches

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.

The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. ""But wait"" he inturrupts, thinking fast, ""if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!""

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""How did you know that that would work?""

""It's simple really"" the bartender says. ""I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar,53391

He thanked her and went back to his golf.



On the back nine the same thing happened; and he approached her again with the same request.

He finished his round and went to the clubhouse where he saw the same lady sitting at the end of the bar.



He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often.



He approached her and! said, ""Let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your help. I understand that you are in the sales profession. I'm in sales also! What do you sell?""



She replied, ""If I tell you, you'll laugh."" ""No, I won't.""



""Well, if you must know,"" she answered, ""I work for Tampax.""



With that, he laughed so hard he almost lost his breath.

He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it.

""You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves"".

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day long"".

The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks, all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.

""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day, commented The Donald.

The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said ""Yeah man, I can handle this"".

The devil smiled and said... ""OK, Monica, you're free to go"".","One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him.",146

The boyshrugged his shoulders and went off to play. Later that day the boy was watching his dad shave. Suddenly his dad blurted out, ""Shit"" when he cuthimself. The boy asked, ""dad what does that mean?"" and his dad cleverly replied, ""That's the brand of shaving cream I'm using."" So the boy wandered into the kitchen where his mom was preparing a turkey for company that evening. As he was watching, his mom burned herself on the stove and blurted out ""Fuck"". Again the boy asked the meaning and the frustrated mother snapped at him, ""It's french for cooking now go answer the door! The company is already here!"" So the boy went, oopened the door, and put his new vocabulary to use, ""Hello bitches and bastards, you can hang your cunts and dicks in the closet. My dad is still in the bathroom putting shit on his face and my mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey.""","One day a little boy over heard his parents in the bedrooom arguing,""You bitch, your cunt is too hairy!",139

When he woke up, he went to Bear and asked him ""I had a dream where I witnessed moments of my life with you besides me, but during the sad moments you weren't there.
