They brought it to their chief who was pleased at the prize but not wanting to anger the villagers of Tobi he hide it by stowing it up in the rafters of his grass hut. 
The next morning the people of Tobi found their beloved thrown gone. They built an even bigger throne. It took more stone and was even grander. The Tobi  chief looked with approval upon the new throne. 
It wasn’t long until the people of Palau found themselves looking at the new throne with great envy. Again they hatched a plan, sailed over to Tobi and stole the throne in the night. The people of Tobi were now perplexed, but seeing footprints they suspected that it was theft. Now they built a giant thrown, ornate and heavy with the local rock. They also set traps and stationed guards. 
The people of Palau were saw the challenge and planned for days. Then during one fateful night they launched their plan. They worked around the traps and dispatched the guards. Using pulleys levers and logs they removed the throne and whisked it back to Palau.  They hoisted the new throne up into the rafters.

There's this girl, Sally, that he's been pining over for years, so he girds his loins and asks her to go with him to the event, and lo and behold she says yes.


Now Joe is starstruck, the girl of his dreams is going to go out with him to the event that's heralded as the pinnacle of senior year students. But again, Joe wants to do everything right so that he has no regrets, so the first thing he works on arranging is a tuxedo - because everyone knows that you have to look good for the prom. So Joe drives himself to the nearest Tuxedo shop only to find out he waited too long and they are all sold out. Not to be stymied, he proceeds from shop to shop until he gets to the last one and finds a huge line. Well, it's the last shop in town thinks Joe, so he waits, and waits and waits, and finally gets up to the line and, defeated, asks the tailor if they have any tuxedos left.


""Yes,"" responds the tailor, ""but it's the last one left and it's honestly the last one left becuase it's the most expensive one."" Undaunted, Joe purchases the tuxedo and arranges for it to be tailored and picked up.

Next up, Joe knows that he needs to get a corsage for his soon-to-be-date, so he heads to the nearest florist, only to find the same problem. Florist after florist is sold out until he gets to the last shop and there's a huge line. Again, undaunted, Joe waits and waits until he gets to the front and asks if they have any flowers (let alone corsages left).


""Yes,"" responds the florist, ""but it's the last one left and it's honestly the last one left becuase it's the most expensive one. It has the best handpicked everything and is sure to go with any dress your date will wear."" Knowing that it's a virtual necessity, Joe makes the order and sets a time and date to pick it up.



Lastly, Joe knows that he needs a pimpin' ride to the prom. So he proceeds to the one and only limosine service in town...and yeah, you guessed it. There's a huge line. Joe is becomming used to this at this point and he knows that he needs the ride to make the night magical. So he waits, and waits, and waits, and he gets to the front and asks the limo service what the have left.


""Well, you're in luck,"" says the limosine contractor, ""we do have a limo available but it's a stretch limo with a driver, and it's the only one left because no one was willing to pay the cost for it."" Accepting his fate, Joe schedules the limo.



The night of the prom arrives, the limo picks up Joe who looks *absolutely* fantastic in his tux, and they drive to Sally's house. At her house he waits at the bottom of the stairs with Sally's parents and she does the most picturesque walk down the stairs - it's like something out of a coming of age movie from the early 90's. She is *gorgeous* and the florist was right, the corsage is a perfect match.



The limo ride to the prom location is fantastic, everyone turns and stares, and when they step out of the limo (with the door opened by the driver as appropriate) it's like they are celebrities at a gala.



They hit the floor and Joe and Sally dance up a storm. Everyone is impressed, there's no doubt who the prom King and Queen will be. And afte ra feverish couple hours they collapse exhausted in chairs and Sally turns to Joe and asks him to get her a drink while she catches her breath. High on life Joe heads over the the drink table expecting the worst, and there is no punch line.",A highschool senior is coming up on his senior prom and really wants the night to go right,4

I am a graphics designer and I normally return home at 6:30pm to my lovely wife and make love to her like a stallion. This was going on routinely for 6 months minus the days she had a head ache. 

One day I came home early and rushed to unlock the door and dashed to the bedroom to see my wife in bed with another man who had hid his face in sheets. He ran outside and I followed him. 

He got into his car before I could see his face. I wasn't going to give up. I got in my car and started chasing him around the block as he swerved left and right and went through one alley and then another alley. He was going too fast for me to catch him and finally he was able to lose me in the midst of a few billboards. 

As I was heading back, I noticed the words ""Jesus Saves"" on one of the billboard and suddenly it seemed all clear to me. 

Now, I would like to ask you good people is this a commercial font that I could buy or a custom design.",Help! I am a graphic designer and my wife is cheating on me!,0

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.

The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.

The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'

The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'

The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'

'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'

'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.'

'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.

That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square

The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.

The president was happy to oblige.

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'

The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  
He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '",An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.,144

I mostly forgot about him, except for when I'd be working late and he'd still just be there... at his desk, doing... something? I dunno. It looked like he was working, at least. 

Anyway, a few months later, after a a day's crunch, I'm walking home around midnight &amp; I spot the same guy. He's walking down the street towing a kid's red wagon behind him. I thought he'd still be at his desk, because he seemed to have a penchant for working late. Curious, I decided to follow him; at a safe distance, of course.

Halfway down the street, he stops and begins unscrewing a 'caution' sign from its post. Once finished, he drops it into the wagon and continues on. I realize that this isn't the first sign he's done this to by the sound of the 'caution' one hitting the wagon.   
He continues like this down the road. Takes down two more. I'd have stayed back to watch to see if he would do anything else, but I had an epiphany:

*As he tries it on it's a perfect fit. The jacket, the pants, the shirt are all exactly made for his body.*

**The man prepares to pay up and leave when the old tailor says:** ""Sir, last time I forgot to mention, but the underwear of the man also speaks volumes for who he is. I can make you custom underwear in just a day, if you are willing.""

This story happened a while ago near Kells, County Meath, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale... it's true. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
John Reilly, a Cavan man studying in UCD, was on the side of the road hitchhiking back to Dublin on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm. 

The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. 

John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... only to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on. The car started moving slowly. 
John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. 

Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window, and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him. 

Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling 
everybody about the horrible experience he had just had. 

A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying... and wasn't drunk. 

Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Reilly sobbing at the bar, one said to the other...

He managed to save himself from flying off a cliff, and trundled to a stop 100 yards later. As he got out, he heard a noise in the distance, and noticed a light shining up the mountain. The noise was unlike anything he had ever heard, and seeing as he needed somewhere to spend the night he hiked towards the light. After a few minutes, he found himself at the door of a monastery.  He told the monks what happened, and they offered to fix his car and let him stay the night. As he was escorted to his room, he asked one of the monks what the noise was. They responded, ""Oh I can't tell you that, you're not a Tibetan monk!"" 

The next morning he drove back to the city, and flew back home to New York. But he couldn't forget the noise, and flew back a few months later, intent on becoming a monk and figuring out the source of this heavenly sound. Upon arrival, he was given three tasks, the first of which involved climbing every mountain in the world and collecting a stone from each. 15 years later he returned to the monastery with his stones, and was given the second task: count every grain of sand in the world. 20 years later he returned and received his third task: take a vow of silence for 10 years while devoting himself to the poor. He completed this task, and at the age of 55, he was finally granted the honor of being a Tibetan monk.

That night, he was given a ring of keys, and brought to the deep basement of the monastery, to learn of the source behind this magical noise. He was left alone in front of a large wooden door, which matched a large wooden key on the ring. He could barely contain himself as he fiddled with the lock, and swung the door open to reveal... another door, made of iron, which matched another key on the ring. With sure hands he unlocked this one and swung it open to reveal... another door, made of gold, which matched another key on the ring. He gurgled in excitement and unlocked the gold door which revealed... another door, made of diamond, which, you guessed it, matched the final key. He quickly unlocked the final door, took a deep breath, pulled it opened, and saw...

Well now that I can't tell you, you're not a Tibetan monk.",The Tibetan Monks,2

The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""

""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.

The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""

""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".

""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.

""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".

""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""

The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""

The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""

The fisherman nods.

The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""

The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".

The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",This joke was posted by the user u/propane13 a year ago and it’s brilliant and I thought more people need to see it so here it is (I take absolutely no credit for this),218

Wounded, the boy snaps back. “You’re insane enough to keep trying.  I just want to live!”

“I get that, I really do.  But you always come back to life, so, really, where’s the harm?  C’mon, about it, am I *wrong?*”

Abel, weary from the endless torment, realizes his brother might be on to something.  With half a smile, he asks “so, what’s your point?”

Cain takes a long moment to think it over.  He’s never really *had* a point to begin with.  Still, he’s not gonna let his stupid younger brother get the last laugh.  “Fun is fun, ya dig, and, like, since you’re not a ‘total loser,’ I’ll agree to stop killing you if you can spill even a drop of my blood.  Every time I kill you, I get to grow an inch taller.  But if you can win, I’ll be you’re slave for ten years.  I bet you...*cain-t* do it, he adds with a devilish smirk.

Abel, sick and tired from dying forever, agrees without a second thought.  He’s not one to think things through, and, really, since they’re *both* immortal, spilling even a drop of Cain’s blood just once is a pretty good deal compared to an eternity of being a loser.  The two brothers shake hands and swear the final blood oath.

Weeks pass, but, despite their deal, Abel just can’t seem to best Cain, who’s already 8’ feet tall at this point, and gives up.  At this point, Cain’s annoyed.  “You’re such a pussy, you know that?  A coward.  You know what?  I bet you’re still a virgin, too.”

“Am not!” Abel’s never been well endowed to begin with, and his Cain’s words wound his pride.  His arrogant brother continues.  “Since I’m so awesome and stuff, I’ll give you a free kill tomorrow.  You’re a midget compared to me, and this is getting, like, *reeeealllly* boring.”

The next day rolls around, and, instead of preparing to fight, Abel’s sitting in his pasture playing the harp for his sheep.  At this point, Cain’s losing his mind.  Shouting taunts at his bro from the top of his farmhouse, Cain’s face is beet red, but Abel can’t seem to hear him.  The giant meets his brother at his pasture, roaring “you’ll NEVER spill my blood, you virgin idiot dumbass!”

Abel, enjoying his song, turns to his brother with a glimmer in his eye.  “Oh, won’t I?  Tell me, brother, who’s blood has stained my pastures and spoiled your crops?” Cain scoffs, completely missing the Mark.  Abel continues. “Aren’t we of the same blood?  All those times I let you spill my blood, you were spilling yours, and you’ve reaped quite the harvest from it, foolish giant.

Cain stammers, his cheeks turn vermillion.  Abel, relishing the smoke from his brothers ears, humbly says the words he’s waited an eternity to say.

“I win.”","Adam and Eve are sick of watching their sons bicker, so they ask God to make the two brothers immortal until they reconcile their differences. After countless deaths and resurrections, Cain finally gives Abel and ultimatum:",0

Carrying a sealed message from his king with only a map to show where to deliver it to

&amp;nbsp;


As he arrived at his destination, he could see movement in the huge, thousand-year old enchanted oak trees and decided to take a closer look

&amp;nbsp;


Upon inspection, he discovered that they were treants! He realised that he had been sent to deliver a message to the kingdom of sentient trees,

&amp;nbsp;


He stopped to ask them directions towards where he should hand in the letter, as he moved closer he realised they were working on a particularly strange looking tree with millions of tiny branches winding like coils.

&amp;nbsp;


“Ahem,” he began, “I’m sorry to bother you but I have been sent to deliver a message to your king, where can I find him?”

&amp;nbsp;


The two treants slowly turned around and looked upon him with suspicious eyes, however they soon relaxed as they realised the elf was alone and not armed.

&amp;nbsp;


“We have no king, only the Great Elder, you can carry onwards west until you find the tall ebony arches which signifies the Royal Halls.” One treant said, speaking softly and well-mannered, before him and his friend turned back to work on the mysterious tree.

&amp;nbsp;


Curious, the elf wished to learn more about what the treants were doing;

“What is it that you’re working on?” he asked,

&amp;nbsp;


Yet again, the treants slowly turned around before stating;
“This is the communication tree, it has magic infused within which can allow us to speak with our kind through it’s many branches, it is our job to send messages and keep it well-maintained.”

&amp;nbsp;


Satisfied, the elf thanked them for the information and carried on towards the Royal Halls.

&amp;nbsp;


Upon arrival, he was ushered into the Great Elder’s chambers, where he was met with darkness and a great silence.

&amp;nbsp;


Suddenly, a loud, booming voice echoed through the room;
“Who enters the Great Chamber?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf was rather spooked by the noise and slinked back before whimpering out the words “I am just a messenger from the elven kingdom,”

&amp;nbsp;


Out of the corner of the room, a giant tree with grey bark and ritualistic carvings slowly stepped into the dim light.

&amp;nbsp;


“I welcome you,” the treat said, a little more softly this time, “I apologise for any discomfort I may have caused you, for sometimes even I do not know the strength of my own voice.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf delivered the letter to the Elder and turned to leave, but was stopped by the Great Elder;

&amp;nbsp;


“Wait, before you go, I wish to apologise for scaring you, it was not my intention. Please, allow me,”

&amp;nbsp;


The treant gave the confused elf food and water before speaking again;

&amp;nbsp;


“I wish to talk to you, I am over a thousand years old and I do not get much company aside from other treants who come here only to worship me. Please, I am somewhat lonely, will you stay and chat with me?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf didn’t want to refuse an offer from the Great Elder - that would be insulting to the whole treant kingdom! So, he accepted, and the two sat for hours chatting about their lives, the elven and treant homes, the differences between their races and how the letter the elf had just delivered was a peace offering between the two kingdoms. 

&amp;nbsp;


However, it was clear that the Elder had very poor social skills, as he sounded and looked uncomfortable and sometimes had nothing to say.

&amp;nbsp;


To lighten the mood, the elf decided to tell a joke.

&amp;nbsp;


He said, “Why did the boar cross the footpath?”

&amp;nbsp;


After a few seconds of intense contemplation, the Elder replied “In order for the boar to cross the footpath, it would have had to have been close to the road, however they are skittish creatures and often do not wander into intelligent civilisation, so the probability of this occurrence would be so incredibly low that I have not considered it ever happening, and unfortunately I do not have an answer to this question.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf, dumbfounded, decided to carry on with the joke and say,
“To get to the other side!”

&amp;nbsp;


The Great Elder thought for an even longer duration, before finally replying,

“Yes, I suppose that is a plausible reason for movement.”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf then realised that the treant had never heard a joke in it’s life! He decided to then teach the Elder how to tell jokes. He explained, in detail, the intricacies of humour to the Elder, who quietly listened with intent. 

&amp;nbsp;


Finally, the elf said, “I have taught you all I know, now I wish to see if I have been successful in my mentoring, please tell me a joke,”

&amp;nbsp;


The Elder steeled himself and thought precariously for 4 long minutes, the elf getting impatient, before finally beginning to speak.

&amp;nbsp;


“Why did the Griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf replied “I don’t know, why *did* the Griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&amp;nbsp;


The great treant then replied, in the most monotonous voice; “Because he thought that it was summertime instead of springtime!”

&amp;nbsp;


The Great Elder burst out laughing with the deepest and heartiest laugh imaginable.

&amp;nbsp;


“Do you understand? Because Griffins normally fly east in the springtime and south in the summertime, but this particular Griffin had mistaken springtime for summertime and flown south instead of east!”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf, not wanting to cause any insult, decided to laugh along with the Great One, however he did not feel like the Elder truly understood the concept of a joke.

&amp;nbsp;


Upon leaving the kingdom to return to his home, the elf found the first two treants he had seen on his journey, and wanted to thank them before making his return.

&amp;nbsp;


As he approached, he saw that they were still working on the magical tree used for the treant’s communications. This time it was twitching and lighting up, it seems the tree was working and the treants were sending messages.

&amp;nbsp;


“Hello, I thank you again for your directions, I have successfully delivered my letter and will be heading off shortly.”

&amp;nbsp;


The treants slowly turned around before waving him off, when one treant said
“Watch out for the two-dimensional spiderlings, I heard that they are a real *plane* in the backside!” 

&amp;nbsp;


The elf laughed out loud, uncontrollably from the unexpected joke.

&amp;nbsp;


“You like that?” The other treant said, “I have one of my own, why did the necromancer’s skeletons flee the battle?”

&amp;nbsp;


The elf smiled and waited for the punchline;


&amp;nbsp;


“Because they had no guts!”

&amp;nbsp;


Again the elf burst out laughing, even harder than the last time.

&amp;nbsp;


“Wow, you guys are great at telling jokes, much better than the Great Elder.” said the elf,

&amp;nbsp;


The treants replied; “Why of course, everybody knows the best jokes are always in the comm-ents!”","An elf courier walked through a dense, mystical forest",52

This story happened a while ago near Kells, County Meath, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale... it's true. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
John Reilly, a Cavan man studying in UCD, was on the side of the road hitchhiking back to Dublin on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm. 

The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. 

John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... only to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on. The car started moving slowly. 
John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. 

Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window, and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him. 

Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling 
everybody about the horrible experience he had just had. 

A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying... and wasn't drunk. 

Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Reilly sobbing at the bar, one said to the other...

Sitting between the doors are 2 huge red identical looking demons. One is seated on an enormous ornately carved ivory chair. The other on an identically carved but shining black ebony chair.


Suddenly, a booming voice from above announces: “Mortal! Listen well, for your salvation depends on it. One of these doors leads to a life of eternal paid and suffering in the realm of hell. The other will gain you your freedom. These demons will guide you, but beware, while one will always answer with the truth, the other speaks only falsehoods. You may ask but one question.”


The demon in the black chair immediately booms: “I am the one who tells the truth.”


The other demon says to you in the same booming voice: “do not listen to my brother Gias, he is the liar.”


The first one turns and yells: “Me the liar?! No! You are the liar. You are Gias, I am Goil, and we are NOT brothers.”


They bicker at each other for a long while. The man listens closely and can hear no inconsistency in either demon’s statements. He ponders for a long time, sweating nervously. Minutes turn to hours as he tries to think of a way out. 


Sudden he steps forward smiling. Turning to the demon on the left, he says: “I am ready to ask my question.” Then he asks in a confident voice: “What would he say,” indicating the other demon, “if I asked him if the red door leads to hell?”


The demon slowly stands to his full height of 20 feet. He turns his head to consider at the man. After a long pause he says:

As he pulled up a stool to the bar to order the strongest drink he could buy, the bartender said, damn it maan, what the hell happened to you!? The sailor looked up exposing fully his very small almost shrunken head right atop his muscular shoulders. The sailor replied in an abnormally high pitch &amp; says— “let me tell you the story”... of course by this time other patrons had began joining in for a good listen too. 
 The sailor begins telling how he had been out at sea &amp; net fishing the last few weeks.  This morning he said, I pulled in a nice big catch of fish, my net was full, although among this great catch was a bit of trash &amp; debris caught in the net. While cleaning it out he came across  a small old brass oil lamp looking piece. It looked like an really old antique &amp; it reminded him of the jinn stories he use to hear as a kid, but never actually believed in.
  Anyway, for the fun &amp; sheer hell of it the sailor says, I gave it a good rub on the top where it looked like words or maybe symbols were nearly hidden engraved beneath the dirt &amp; algae. Much to my complete surprise out appears the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen! Except she was almost see thru like holographic. Just then as he stood nearly frozen, looking shocked &amp; in disbelief. 
 The beautiful woman began to speak saying, it was crucial no one else must see her or there could be dire consequences &amp; so she politely asked to be returned to the sea without any trouble please. As a reward however, she promised the sailor just one wish if he promised not to tell anyone of its existence or location. He happily agreed to the deal &amp; begin thinking of a single wish. Since he was fairly wealthy he didn’t really want the usual things, but he did wish that the beautiful looking genie would become human &amp; then marry him. She replied, Thats a nice thought, but my home is not of this world, and she simply could not become something she wasn’t. The wealthy sailor now frustrated by what he perceived as complete rejection says ok then &amp; wished for her to make love to him somehow... allowing him the greatest pleasure ever! The beautiful jinn replied like the first time, I’m sorry, but I’ve already told you I am not &amp; can not become part of this world. Sorry pal, but there are limits to this arrangement. 
The Sailor now utterly disappointed &amp; unable to wish for what he wanted said, so let me get this straight! No marvelous bride? No hot stellar sex. Nothing of the sort? That’s correct the jinn said. So as a last ditched effort without considering any consequences, he blurted out damn it not even just a little head?
