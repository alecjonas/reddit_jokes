The first guest, who is from Italy, tees off and hits a good shot 200 yards down the fairway. As the American businessman knows a small amount of Italian he says: “Buon tiro”, which means “Good shot”. The Italian businessman replies: “Grazie”.
The second guest, who is from France, tees off and hits a fantastic shot that lands on the green thirty feet from the hole. As the American businessman knows a small amount of French he says: “Tir fantastique”, which means “Fantastic shot”. The French businessman replies: “Merci”.
The third guest, who is from Japan, tees off and amazingly the ball goes straight in the hole, a hole in one! The American businessman doesn’t know many Japanese words or phrases but when he dated a Japanese girl during his overseas business trips she used to moan when he made love to her and she would shout out “Ura-ana, ura-ana”, and which he repeats to his Japanese guest.

'Could you run the store on your own for a couple of hours, Jeremy?' he asks.

'Sure thing boss!' Jeremy replied, 'don't you worry, I've got this.'

So the boss leaves for his errands, leaving young Jeremy in charge of the store.

Some time later, a woman walks in. She's in search of a mechanized equivalent of the male boomstick of glory. Jeremy shows her the so-called model 'Hercules'; huge, veiny and with a firm grip. The woman is very intrigued and leaves the store thrilled to bits. 

Several other women pass by aswell and Jeremy proves himself to be a keen salesman of battery-powered penises. All women leave the store satisfied with their purchase.

Then an elderly lady walks in the store in search of some private pleasure. Jeremy shows her the top of the stock, but the lady seems dearly unimpressed. Then, a spectacular model catches her eye. 'What about that red one?' she asks. 'Oh, I see, mylady is a connoisseur!' Jeremy replies. He shows her the model and with a light tred and a big grin, the lady leaves the store.

Later that afternoon, the boss returns and asks how business has been.

Beaming with pride, Jeremy replies: 'It was great! I sold quite a lot!'

'Oh really?' the boss asks, impressed, 'what models did you sell?'

'Well sir, 1 model Hercules, 1 model King Kong, 2 LongSchlong21's and the fire-extinguiser.'

A man came in and asked Juan for half a pound of butter. The boy told him they only sold 1 lb packets of butter, but the man was persistent.

The boy said he'd go ask his manager what to do.

Juan walked into the back room and said, ""There's a crazy ass fellow out there who wants to buy half a pound of butter.""

As he finished saying this he turned around to find the man standing right behind him,

So he added, ""And this gentleman wants to buy the other half.""

The manager finished the deal and later said to Juan, ""You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got yourself out of it. You think on your feet, and I like it a lot. Which place are you from?""

Juan replied, ""I'm from Colombia, sir.""

""Oh really? Why did you leave Colombia?"" asked the manager.

Juan replied, ""They're all just prostitutes and soccer players over there.""

""My wife is from Colombia,"" the manager said.

Juan replied, ""Which team did she play for?""

“I woke up this morning to find that I had a pinkish red ring around my penis.”

“I see.” said the doctor.

The donator examined the ring for a few minutes and then he looked the man in the eye. He takes out a small bottle with a liquid inside.

“If you apply this liquid to the ring, it should disappear right away”

He walks to his room and goes to sleep,

When he wakes up the next morning, the ring comes back again, he drives to the doctor to get another bottle. 

The doctor gave him another bottle and he put the liquid on. The ring instantly vanished. Then, he went to work.

After his job was done he went to his house and slept. On the third day, the ring on his penis appeared again, so he went to the doctor to get another bottle.

He waited patiently at the front desk and when they finally called his name, he went to the room. He asked then doctor for another bottle.

“Okay.”

“Hey, how much will all these bottles cost?” Asked the man.

“It’s fairly cheap” said the doctor.

“Hey doc, one more thing,”

“What?”

“What is this stuff?” Asked the man.

“Lipstick remover.” Says the doctor.

Finally a third vampire strolls through the door and walks confidently up to the barkeep and the other vampires. He opens his fanged mouth to speak, but the Barman interrupts him: ""Let me guess..."" he opines, ""One large glass of warm blood?"". To his surprise the vampire shakes his head.

The Bartender is confused but is unwilling to question the motives of a vampire, especially a vampire customer and produces the boiling water for his guest. The other vampires, also curious pause their drinking to stare at the new arrival.

John didn’t have many friends growing up as he preferred to keep to himself. Johns family were farmers through and through, his favourite thing to do was to drive their tractor around and around the farm, john always adored tractors, the big back wheels and the small front ones, unheard of! The exhaust coming out of the top, unbelievable! it brought john so much joy in his life.

It was nearing Christmas and john wasn’t really sure on what he wanted. He spent all his time driving the tractor around, his parents started to believe that john was lonely, they wanted to give john a friend. In that exact moment, johns parents knew what to do.

It was finally Christmas, john woke up and rushed downstairs to see what things Santa and his parents had gotten him. There were boxes scattered under the Christmas tree, john immediately rushed to the biggest one and tore the wrapping off as fast as he could, he opens the box and out jumps a small puppy which immediately dashes towards john and starts licking him. John picks up the dog and says to him “I think I’ll name you buddy”, buddy looks at him with playful eyes and gives a small bark. Johns parents knew that they were going to be best friends.

John and buddy immediately started having a blast together, they’d do everything together, john started taking buddy for rides with him in his tractor, as they were driving around the farm buddy would stick his head off the side and poke his tongue out at the wind. When they weren’t in the tractor, they’d be playing games of fetch or chasing the rabbits around the farm. There was this one time when they were chasing rabbits, john tripped over a stick and landed face first into the ground, almost as soon as it happened, buddy turned around and raced back as fast as he could to make sure john was ok, he gave off a slight whimper as john struggled to get back up, “don’t worry boy I’m fine, just a grazed knee is all” john spoke with a tear in his eye. Buddy and john then walked back to the house together after a long day. John and buddy truly were best friends for life.

Years had passed and john and buddy were as close as ever. But one night, as everyone was asleep, john heard a thud. He woke up with a shock, he grabbed a torch and went to go and investigate on the noise. he walked out the door and called buddy’s name. No response. He turned the corner. Nothing. There was only one spot left to look. The tractor. He headed there as fast as he could. Common sense had flown out the window. He tripped and grazed his knee. There was no reassuring whimper. He picked himself up. He turned the corner into the shed. There was buddy. Under the wheel of the tractor. John couldn’t take it. All he could do was scream at what was before him. His best friend and his love for tractors were both replaced with a deep, seething hate for tractors.
John never lost his hatred of tractors, it started to consume him. His parents sold the farm and moved to the city in order to try and save their child. As the years passed, john accomplished many things in his life. Passed school with flying colours, got a degree in electrical engineering, he even got himself a loving wife and two kids, but despite all that, his hatred for tractors always stuck in the back of his mind. Teasing him. Taunting him.

It had been 20 years since the incident. John was on his way back from work, taking his usual route past his favourite bar, as he got towards the bar though he noticed that smoke was emanating from the building, choking the people inside. People were suffocating. Dying. John knew he had to do something. He raced towards the bar at full speed and kicked open the door, he then proceeded to breathe in all the air and suck it all into his body. He kept breathing it in until there was no smoke left. Everyone was saved. A man ran over to john and asked him “how’d you do it? How’d you breathe in all that smoke?” john turned to the man and said…

His rations were meager, his work in the coal mines hard. But one day, he gets a ray of hope, solace from his hardships, when, as he’s driving his Lada from his home to the local coal mine, he sees a sign.

“Swimming Lessons: Improve Strength for Motherland! 500 rubles.”

So Ivan decides that the best thing to do is to trade in his Lada, and skip lunch for a month. He does so, walking to the mine and skipping lunch every day for a month, and after this, he gets enough money to go and swim. So he does, and he excels in it. He swims so well that after the first class, the instructor tells him to go home, because he might make the other Comrades feel bad. And we wouldn’t want that, now would we, Comrade Ivan?

Well, Ivan says, I have endured many hardships in my life. I suppose this shall be one more.

So Ivan goes home, wet and dejected, and goes walking to the mine the next day. Then, he sees a sign that says “Advanced swimming lessons! Improve skill for motherland! 5000 Rubles.”

So, Ivan figures that if he keeps his shoes particularly dry, and skips on dinner, he will have enough within the month. Do he does so, and after a month of blisters and starvation, he gets enough to go to the advanced swimming lessons. He attends the class, and the instructor tells him at the end that he is a natural, and thus should not come to the class anymore, for fear of making the other comrades feel bad.

Well, Ivan says, I have endured many hardships in my life. I suppose this shall be one more.

He goes home, wet, cold, and dejected.

But then, the next day, as he walks to the coal mine, he sees another sign. Try out for Olympic Trials! Win glory for Motherland! Fifty-thousand rubles.

So, Ivan decides, that if he keeps his shoes particularly clean, and lives off nothing but crackers and butter for the next two months, he can afford it. So, he does so, and after months of hard work and toil on nothing, even for a Soviet peasant, Ivan has 50 000 rubles. He applies to he on the Olympic team, and amazing, he makes it!

So, as he’s in the Olympic finals, he is told he must swim from a cruise ship to a nearby island. He says that this is no challenge for him. But, just as the event is about to start, there’s a great snap. Everyone thinks the gun has gone off, but a lifeboat has actually fallen off. And is now floating right in Ivan’s path. Everyone lets out a horrified gasp, and sees Ivan, swimming star of the USSR, smash headfirst into lifeboat.

But, he gets up! And he walks off the edge, dives in, and wins gold for mother Russia!

When the Western reporters get to him, they ask him “how did you survive that crash?”

Ivan smiles.

“You see, I have endured many hard ships in my life.”

They were remarked to be the best, better than the best, the best of the best. With a reputation like that, it was no wonder that he was popular amongst the elite of the elite. Why he made them for Goberchov, he made them for Kasparov, he made them for anybody, who was anybody.

Well eventually the Kremlin fell, and Igor was a little bemused, but not surprised that he attracted the best of the west. He made ties for Prince Charles, for Obama, for Jack Nicholson, anybody, who was anybody.

It was no surprise then too when the biggest somebody who was anybody walked through his door with his thinning pate of elaborately quaffed hair. President Trump.

‘I’m a busy man Igor, but I hear you’re the best, and well I’m the best, so as you can understand, I deserve the best.’

Igor knew better than to give opinions to opinionated men, he just smiled politely and reached for his tape measure.

‘Step on it OK, I need to be out of here in 5 minutes.’

Within minutes the fitting was done, the tie was sold and everyone out the door a little happier than when they walked in.

Now if, and only if, there was a criticism of Igor’s ties… It was that his ties were a little precise, a little too precise. Precision on a healthy neck was perfection, but on a neck belonging to the voluptuous body of a man of some considerable carriage however, they were nigh on lethal.

Picture the scene then as President Trump returned to Igor’s shop within hours, clutching at his throat, nee clawing. His face was turning blue, then purple and his eyes red and mournful, his lips pink and twisted.

‘Whatever is the matter?’ asked Igor sincerely, withdrawing in shock.

Trump pointed as his throat.

‘You don’t like the colour?’ Asked Igor

Trump was gasping and gasping for breath that didn't come.

'Perhaps a cravat?' Igor offered up in his confusion.

Trump managed to loosen the tie just a little and he screamed ‘Can’t you see these Russian ties are killing me.’",The Tie Salesman,6

""Very well. You will have your lifespan reduced to 30"", god replied.

Next came the dog, "" You will live a very active life. You will have more intelligence than the ass but often no one will ever value your opinion. Your sole purpose is to be mankinds companion. You will love your master unconditionally but they will not always love you the same way. I have determined that you will live for 30 years."", god said to him.

The healer says: “You see, in every man’s soul there is a lot of rage and violence. But as he grows older and wiser, he will learn to control his anger. My ancestors believed that all this violence is locked up behind the fah-khab; the gate of wisdom. Well what happens when a man’s fah-khab breaks open? I think you know the answer. But don’t worry, I have a very strong potion that will protect you. Be warned though, it is also poisonous. Whatever you do, don’t swallow it. Just take a sip and keep it in your mouth. It will be safe until your husband goes to bed, then you can spit it out.” 

And so he opens a drawer, gives her a little brown bottle and with another warning about never swallowing the potion, he sends her on her way. 

The next day she comes back: “I can’t believe it. I tried the potion yesterday and my husband came home, gave me a kiss, made dinner, cleaned up afterwards and then poured a bath for me. I’ve never seen him so gentle and loving. You have to tell me how the potion works!”

I pull in without any worries - I'd only been driving an hour, had only 10,000 lb. onboard, far less than is needed to fail a weight check.

As my truck is coming off the portable scale a young officer hops up on the catwalk of the truck while it is still moving (albeit slowly) and asks, ""What're you hauling driver?""

I shoot him an evil look over the hop up - it's a major safety don't do, but answer him, ""Toys sir.""

This prompts a 5 minute tongue lashing the likes I've not heard before or since. He was so loud that two other officers came over to see if he needed backup.  I waited for him to finish, which he eventually did with, ""now tell me exactly what in hell you're hauling or I'll have your ass hauled off to jail.""

I said, ""Toys, sir.  Plastic buckets, Plastic wheelbarrows, and chalkboards, from the Plesko Toy Factory in Pookeepskie (sp?) up the road and consigned to Target Stores' distribution center in Denver Colorado.""

I handed him the paperwork. He read them. Without a single sound he handed them back, and when to the restrooms. When he was out of earshot the other two officers burst out laughing.

""Do you need anything else officers?""

""No son,"" the eldest one told me, ""You made our day. Have a safe drive now.""

The moral of the story is, if a truck driver tells you he's hauling toys he might actually be hauling toys.",If a Truck Driver Tells You He's Hauling Toys... (True Story),4

He got there as quickly as he could, despite living roughly half an hour away. He managed to get to work before any of his coworkers that were capable of operating on the new patient could. He really wanted to operate on this patient. He regretted not sleeping in the on-call room overnight, but who would’ve know that this patient would arrive?

The doctor headed into the patient’s room only to see that the patient and his family were all there and extremely happy. At least no other surgeons arrived to take this case away from him.

“Hello, I’m Dr. Smith, I’ll be your doctor and surgeon for this operation. May I know why you guys are all so happy? This will be a very risky surgery, and you could lose your life because of it. It will be a very long and difficult operation.”

The patient replied, “Well, we’ve heard so much about you, Dr. Smith, and we have a firm belief that you will be able to remove all three tumors, so we are quite happy knowing that you will probably keep me alive longer than I’d be if I didn’t undergo this operation.”

“Wow,” said the doctor, “I didn’t realize all of you would be so confident in me. Anyways I’ll fill you in on the details.”

The doctor began to feel quite nervous and he felt a lot of pressure because of all the confidence they had in him. He felt like he had to keep the patient alive despite the surgery being so difficult. He still decided to follow through with the operation anyways. He scheduled it for two days from now.

During those two days that he prepared for the operation, thinking about how he’ll do it, he felt very nervous and stressed. The time kept ticking by, and eventually the two days passed, and it was time to perform the surgery.

He drove to work that morning trying to remain calm. Normally he’d feel fine before performing a surgery, but this time he felt nervous which was unlike him. He met with the patient and his assistant, and they took him up to the OR (operation room). It was time to start the operation.

There were 3 tumors, one brain tumor and two on the patient’s spine. He decided to start with the brain tumor. He put the patient under anesthesia and got to work. His hands felt a bit shaky at first, but he put his nervousness aside and focused on his task. He spent hours and hours operating, and he became very tired, but he continued to operate. After a couple more hours and a couple complications, he finally removed the brain tumor without any further problems caused.

He decided to take a short rest and he sat in his chair by the patient and said “Whew, one down, tumor to go.”",The Surgeon’s Operation,18

    SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS
    HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION
    10 MILES

He thinks this is a figment of his imagination and drives on without second thought..

Soon he sees another sign which reads:

    SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS
    HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION
    5 MILES

Suddenly he begins to realize that these signs are for real and drives past a third sign saying:

    SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS
    HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION
    NEXT RIGHT

His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive. On the far side of the parking lot is a stone building with a small sign next to the door reading:

    SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS
     HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 

He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a  nun in a long black habit who asks, 'What may we do for you my son?'

 He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly doing business....'

'Very well my son. Please follow me.' He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.'

He does so and another nun in a long habit, holding a tin cup answers the door... This nun instructs, 'Please place $100 in the cup then go through the large wooden door at the end of the hallway.'

 He puts $100 in the cup, eagerly trots down the hall and slips through the door pulling it shut behind him.

The door locks, and he finds himself back in the parking lot facing another sign:



GO IN PEACE.
YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS.

Eddie grimaces a little before reluctantly agreeing. He quickly reaches over and undoes the guy's zipper. 

Armless guy then says, ""Do you think you could, you know, pull it out for me? Sorry to ask, but I'm about to piss myself. 

Eddie says, ""You gotta be kidding. You're asking me to grab your dick and aim it towards the pisser?""

""Please, man, I don't have any other options here.""

Eddie, feeling sorry for the guy and feeling pissed off simultaneously, mutters to himself as he reaches in, and gingerly pulls out his dick. As he does, he first of all notices this putrid smell before seeing several open oozing sores on the guy's dick. Totally disgusting. While the guy is pissing, Eddie rushes over to the sink and washes his hands in hot water. As  the armless guy finishes up, Eddie grabs a couple of paper towels because he knows what's coming. Sure enough, he gets asked if he'll put it away for him. 

As he tucks the guy's horrific pecker back into his trousers and buttons him up, Eddie says to the guy, ""OK listen, I'm sorry but I have to ask ... What the hell is the deal with your dick?!

""Beats the shit out of me,"" he answers, and then produces both arms from inside his jacket and slides them into his sleeves, ""But I sure as fuck don't want to touch it.""",Guy named Eddie walks into the men's room at a bar.,310

post,aghvig,2qh72,jokes,false,1547615967,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aghvig/problematic_porsche/,self.jokes,,"A local nightclub owner walked into a nearby exotic car dealership hoping to sell his new limited edition Porsche on trade-in and upgrade to the even newer Ferrari. He claimed that he always needed the best and newest tech and that it would help him to pick up young attractive women as he pulled up in his new red Ferrari. 


The salesman told him that he could keep it in the showroom and once it sold he could use the proceeds toward the new Ferrari. They agreed on a price for the car and the previous owner knew his car would sell super quick since it was very limited, and everyone was looking for one in stock. He was hoping to get his new Ferrari within days. 


Sure enough an interested buyer walked in the next day and took it for a test ride. He came back five minutes later. He loved the car and it performed flawlessly, but he complained of a sharp pain in the bottom of the seat cushion. The salesman said maybe the car wasn’t for him, but thanked him anyway. 


The very next day another man came in and caught a glimpse of the limited edition guards red Porsche turbo in the corner. “Wow, can I test drive that?,” he said.  “Sure,” said the salesman, and off he went to grab the keys. This time the test drive lasted only 2 minutes. The interested buyer loved the new styling and the amazing acceleration, but he was being stabbed by this seat, this time in the side bolster. The salesman apologized and the man went on his way. 


The previous owner called later the same afternoon wondering how his car had not sold!?! He is eager to get his new Ferrari and is not going to buy it until he sells the Porsche. “It has been nearly 36 hours, this car is rare and you must be too stupid to sell it! No wonder you are a car salesman, you will never amount to anything, and will never be able to afford a car like this! You are just jealous and don’t want to sell it! You’re not going to get any commission unless you sell that car!!”


The salesman calmed him down and suggested they wait another day. 


The very next morning the third interested buyer walked in when he heard they had the car in stock. He immediately asked for a test drive, and seemed ready to buy. But he too came back, this time complaining of what he believed to be a spring poking him through the seat. It may have even drawn blood. Even he couldn’t buy the car after this experience. The salesman thanked him for his time, and he went in his way. 


The previous owner called back furious after finding out what happened. He called him every name in the book. “What kind of fuxking idiot salesman can’t sell a car like this. I am waiting for my Ferrari, and the Porsche should be sold by now! I have had tons of Porsches in the past, and none of them have had this problem. When I turned that car in the seat was fine!”


The quick witted salesman stated that maybe the previous owner was actually the problem, and that he wasn’t factoring that into the equation.


“What?!”, the man shouted, “what the fuck are you talking about!!!!?!”


“Well...” said the salesman, “ it’s common knowledge that for every Porsche you see driving on the street, there’s always just enough room for exactly one gigantic PRICK in the drivers seat!”

Gabriel convenes with the Angels, and they get down to thinking. They decide not to do another flood, since they said they wouldn't do that again. Fire and brimstone is ruled out for being too destructive. Then Gabriel says, ""Maybe instead of looking for a direct solution, we should look for the root cause of the problem."" After much deliberation, the cause of all the excess sinning is found.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel goes to the Lord and says, ""We've done it, we've found the cause of all this sinning. It's the oral sex. All the oral sex people are having is causing this sinning. So we've decided to send a message to all the people having oral sex, so that they will stop."" The Lord says, ""No, we won't do that. Instead, we will craft a ten-word message for all the people *not* having oral sex. Those ten words will be so enlightening, so impactful, so awe-inspiring, that those few not having oral sex will feel compelled to share it with all the rest.""

One of the more important battles in the subsequent Reconquista was the siege of Cordoba. Though historians debate what exact tactics the commander of each side used during the clash, one of the more controversial theories suggested that the Catholic Navarran general used an unorthodox tactic. 

Having surrounded the Muslim-controlled city, he had half of his men charge the city while ordering the rest to remain standing still, looking confused. 

Sensing some form of indecision, the Moors tried to take advantage and sallied from their walls to engage the split-up force, but it was a trap. The general had successfully baited the Moorish army outside where he slaughtered them before they could retreat.

JAPANESE TOURIST: (Proudly beaming) Ah! A Suzuki truck made in my country Japan...**very fast!**  
FILIPINO TAXI DRIVER: (Thinking to himself, feeling slightly annoyed) Damn, so it is true the Japanese are nationalistic! This guy is full of it.

Then a man in a Honda motorcycle roared past them...

JAPANESE TOURIST: (Proudly gloating) Mister driver, look!!! Honda motorcycle made in Japan! **Very fast!** Ha-ha!  
FILIPINO TAXI DRIVER: (Thinking to himself, now annoyed) I know your country is good...Damn it. Do you have to rub it in?

To add insult to injury, a Toyota Hilux pick-up truck suddenly overtook the taxi and ran past them.

JAPANESE TOURIST: (Now shouting like a Samurai) Ha-ha!!! Mister driver, look!!! Toyota Hilux pick-up truck proudly made in Japan! Powerful and **very fast!** Bwa-ha-ha!  
FILIPINO TAXI DRIVER: (Still thinking to himself, now feeling hurt, angry and saddened) How the hell do I show this guy something that my country is not just good-for-nothing?

They finally arrived at their destination. A classy hotel at the edge of town. And so it was time for the Filipino taxi driver to bill his passenger.

FILIPINO TAXI DRIVER: That would be one thousand pesos or about twenty dollars, please.  
JAPANESE TOURIST: (Now greatly surprised) What the...Why a bit high??? It was only a few kilometers ride from the international airport!  
FILIPINO TAXI DRIVER: (Now proudly beaming) Aha! Sir, for your information, that taxi meter is made in the Philippines! Very fast!!!

post,aggjtq,2qh72,jokes,false,1547606377,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aggjtq/the_three_monks/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there were three monks who decided to leave the monastery and open a flower shop where they could sell flowers and exotic plants. They moved into a very small town and were doing quite the good business until one day, they got in an exotic man-eating plant. The monks were quite excited about the new arrival and told all of the townspeople to come see it! Unfortunately, it wasn't long before the plant ate one of the townsfolk.

Now, this was a small town, remember, and it was now getting smaller all the time so, the mayor called a meeting at the small old town hall. Once the few residents has gathered, he asked them what they thought they should do about the monks and their man-eating plant. The town's only police officer stood up and declared ""I'm the law in these parts, I'll run them out!"" This was met with approval by one and all. 

So, the police officer goes to the flower shop and, tells the monks ""get out of town and take your man-eating plant with you!' The monks are rather shocked by this and ask the officer if he has even seen the offending plant in order to get the evidence he needed to run them off. He of course hadn't so, he goes in to see the plant, and wouldn't you know it, he gets to close and it eats him!

Now, this was a small town, remember, and it was now getting smaller all the time. They did not even have a police officer now! So, the mayor called a meeting at the small old town hall. Once the few remaining residents has gathered, he asked them what they thought they should do about the monks and their man-eating plant. The town's only fire fighter stood up and declared ""I'll chop down that plant with my trusty ax!"" This was met with approval by one and all. 

And so, the fireman goes to the shop to run the monks out of town, he is met by the bewildered monks at the door of the shop. ""get out of my way monks!"" he cries, ""I'm here to take care of that pesky plant of yours!"". Frightened by this burly man wielding an ax, the monks quickly retreat. The fireman charges into the room, trips over a loose board and falls right into the mouth of the man eating plant!

Now, this was a small town, remember, and it was now getting smaller all the time. They did not even have a police officer or a fire fighter now! So, the mayor called a meeting at the small old town hall. Once the few remaining residents has gathered, he asked them what they thought they should do about the monks and their man-eating plant. A little elderly woman near the back stands up and meekly says, ""My nephew Hugh can stop them!"" There is great commotion in response to this but, the people finally agree that this is as good of a plan as any, ""not like we have anyone else, right?""

And so, Hugh, goes down to the flower shop and demands that the monks leave town immediately and that they take their man-eating plant with them. And wouldn't you know it, those monks took off faster than you could blink!

The moral of this story, Hugh, and only Hugh can prevent Florist Friars.

The gate agent informed her that there was no way she could carry the dog aboard the plane, but assured her the dog would be perfectly safe in the luggage compartment, so reluctantly she gave up little Hymie to travel downstairs.

When the flight landed, the luggage handlers discovered that little Hymie was dead, so to avoid disappointing the old lady, they made up a security related excuse to keep the plane on the tarmac and all passengers aboard, while they sent agents to every pet store in Tel Aviv to find an identical looking dog.

After an hour and a half, during which all the passengers believed the security personnel were looking for a bomb or something, they made the switch, pulled up to the gate, and allowed the passengers to deplane.

Soon a committee gathered to finally put an end to the speculation. A group of 10 scientists and doctors gathered together in the room, hooking up machines to monitor a very nervous patient's vitals. Some of the more superstitious clutched crosses and other symbols to potentially ward off evil spirits. The event was also being live streamed to viewers everywhere.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. 

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. 

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. 

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. 

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.﻿

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, dad.

She's pregnant.

Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true.

I'm over at Jason's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

Call when it is safe for me to come home!

Since he wasn't going to waste fish that he'd caught, he decides to go ahead and cook them anyways and see how they taste. To his delight, the mystery fish are quite magnificent. He digs around in his attic for an old fishing book that his grandfather had passed down to him, and lo and behold identifies the fish as the ""son of a bitch."" 

Excited, the fisherman goes and sees the priest, who is a good friend of his. He cooks the fish and serves it to the priest, and as he is eating, the fisherman asks the priest. 

""So Father, how are you likin' these sons of bitches?""

The priest is shocked, and scolds the man for using such profanity towards a man of God. Embarrassed, the fisherman quickly explains that it is only the name of the fish. The priest calms down and reveals that it is indeed the best fish he's ever had. The priest calls the deacon from the next town over, and tells him that he must come and try the fish. 

The following day, the fisherman, the priest, and the deacon all sit down for the fish fry. As the deacon is eating the fish, the priest asks him. 

""So Deacon, how are you likin' these sons of bitches?""

Understandably, the deacon is outraged that a priest would use foul language in his presence. However, he does loosen up after the priest and fisherman quickly explain to him that it is only the name of the fish. 

The deacon ends up enjoying the fish so much so that he calls in a few favors and manages to get the Pope to visit the small town. The town is ecstatic, and plans an enormous feast to celebrate the Pope's arrival. The fisherman catches fish for weeks in preparation for the event. The day finally comes when the pope arrives, and the fisherman, the priest, and the deacon are all very eager for him to try the fish. 

They finally sit down, and the Pope begins to eat. Shortly after, the deacon asks him. 

""My dear Holy Father, how are you likin' these sons of bitches?"" 

The Pope looks aghast at him, shocked at what he said. Suddenly, his face softens, he leans back in his chair and puts his feet up on the table and says, ""Motherfuckers ain't bad.""

Cortez replies, ""I'm a Democrat, I'm beautiful, I'm a Socialist, I'm going to DC and I'm staying right here.""

Sometimes you don't really want all that effort so you just grab some bread and slap some lunch-meat on it and have a quick sandwich. Satisfies the hunger and you don't have to do all that work.

One day, a man with no arms finds the priest of the church and says, “Father, I’d like to be your official bell ringer.”

Confused, the priest responds “But how can you ring the bell with no arms?”

The man replies, “Just take me to the bell and I’ll show you. Trust me.”

Still confused, but curious, the priests humors him and takes him to the top of the bell tower. When they got up there, the armless man readies himself, and runs full tilt at the bell, slamming his head against it. The bell begins to move. 

The priest is shocked, but part of him is still intrigued, so he just stands and watches as the man with no arms rams into the bell a second time, and then a third. At this point, the clapper of the bell has begun to hit the inside. People from all over the village are coming out of their houses, confused that the bell that had stayed silent for so long was now ringing again. 

The armless man, visibly disoriented, readies himself for one last ram. He charges forward, but this time misjudges his run and flies straight past the bell, off the edge of the tower, and falls to the ground, dead. The people below are shocked, and look up to see the priest staring down at them. 

“Father,” they say, “Who is this man? What’s going on?”

To this the priest responds “Well...I don’t know his name. But his face rings a bell!”",One of my old theater director’s favorites,20

Smiling proudly at his son's quest for improvement, he eagerly agrees, ""Of course, my son! Of course! What do you wish to know? How to track buffalo? Or perhaps how to find water in the desert?""

Reluctant still, the young boy continues ""father, I wish to know who chooses the names given to children born here in the village.""

The chief frowned, disappointed, ""Well as chief of the people, that responsibility lies with me. This is common knowledge in the village. You did not need to seek me out for this simple question.""

""Yes, father"" the boy agrees, ""but how do you *know* what names to give the children?""

""Ah,"" said the chief, his hardened expression softening a bit, ""Now that is a much better question. For, none in the village know my secret.""

""What is it, father?"" the boy asks with great interest. 

""I shall tell you, as this will one day be your duty"" the chief said with excitement, ""The great spirits send me messages at the exact moment when a baby is born. That is how I give names to newborns.""

Confused, the young boy questions further, ""But father, how? How do they send you messages?""

The chief shurgs, ""It is always different. I never know."" Seeing that the boy was still confused, he said ""I will give you an example; your brother Running Bear, the night he was born I looked out into the night and saw a brown bear running into the woods. That was the spirits telling me to name your brother Running Bear.""

""And what about my cousin?"" The boy shyly asked.

""Your cousin, Soaring Eagle?"" Said the chief, ""Well, the morning he was born, I looked up to see a great eagle soar over the village. This was the spirits telling me to name your cousin Soaring Eagle.""

At this, he noticed tears welling up in the boys eyes, and the chief, at his wits end, blurted out, ""Now enough of this, Two Dogs Fucking, tell me what is wrong!""","A young native American boy visits his father, the chief of the village",25

""My son! Please refrain from using that type of language, The Lord can hear you!"" gasps the priest. The sailor apologizes and they proceed with their game.

The sailor now attempts to chip his ball out of the brush. He gets off a good shot, but it rolls back into a sand trap. ""Fuck, I missed!"" he says again.

""My son! Please, refrain from such sinful language! You will anger the Lord!"" the priest pleads. The sailor apologizes and they continue their game.

The sailor takes a whack at his ball from the sandtrap. He has a great shot, landing the ball right on the green. Still it's not good enough for him, so yet again he mutters ""fuck, I missed!""

The priest bursts out, yelling ""my son! The Lord will strike you down should you continue in your sinful ways! You will be punished for your sins!"" The sailor apologizes profusely and lines up his putt. The putt heads straight for the hole... and then runs around the rim and stays out. ""FUCK! I MISSED!"" the sailor exclaims, louder than before.

Out of nowhere, a lightning bolt shoots from the sky. It streaks down from the clouds and hits the priest, instantly killing him. A deep, booming voice from the heavens speaks... ""FUCK! I MISSED!",A sailor and a priest are out golfing.,24902
