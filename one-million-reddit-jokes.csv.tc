The first prisoner is jerking his head side to side, and as his head goes back and forth, he makes peculiar sounds.

The general makes note of this behavior in his journal, nods his head, and continues to walk down the line.

As he looks over the last prisoner, he too is making weird noises and movements.

In the Hurricane, one of the only two bridges linking the village to the mainland was destroyed. When I arrived, he asked why I was late, and I explained that the bridge I usually drove on into the village had been destroyed, and wasn't going to be repaired, as the government simply did not have the resources to build a thirty foot bridge for such a small village.

""Thirty feet?"" He answered back. ""Y'know, a black family just moved in round the corner. Cut their feet off, almost got yourself thirty feet right there"".

Once again, he had surprised me with his ignorance. I jokingly played along. ""For some reason, I don't think you could drive a car down a bridge made of feet.""

""Holy shit!"" the guy exclaims.

""We are the genies of the lamp. We have been stuck inside that lamp for decades, and you have freed us. We will grant you three wishes!"" the first genie proclaims.

The man thinks. ""OK, first I want ten million dollars in my bank account, and I want it legal! No crimes or anything.""

The second genie claps his hands. ""IT IS DONE!"" He looks at the man. ""Your second wish?""

""I want my garage and driveway to be full of expensive cars. Nothing worth less than $500,000!"" the man says.

""Done!"" says the first genie, clapping his hands together. ""And for your final wish?""

The man turns red. ""Listen, uh...this is going to be a bit embarrassing so can I just whisper it to you?"" he asks the second genie.

""Of course,"" the second genie replies.

The man leans over and whispers his final wish to the second genie. The second genie motions for the other genie to follow him and they both walk out of the basement.

A minute later, a group of men in white robes bursts into the basement and grabs the man who had made the wishes. The man struggled against them, but the men tied him up, tied a rope around his neck, and pulled him up by the rafters until he was dead.

After a few minutes, two of the robed men remove their hoods and look at each other. It's the two genies. ""I can understand the wish for the money and the wish for luxury cars,"" the second genie said, ""but why the fuck did he want to be hung like a black man?""",A man was cleaning out the basement of the house his grandfather left him...,915

POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50. The second man thinks for a bit, then says, ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says, ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says, ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says, ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says, ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says, ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says, ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says, ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still rotating his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. 

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

""That's a good thing isn't it? Maybe we could find somebody who knows the way back to the trail. HEEEELLLLLPPP!""

As soon as the scream passed his lips, 6 strong tribesman jumped out of the trees and captured them. They were gagged, blindfolded, and bound. They both mumbled in fear and anger as they were led down a twisting path. 

They were brought before the chief of this tribe and forced to their knees. Their blindfolds and gags were removed. 

""I told you to shut up! Look what you've done!"", spat Dennis at John. 

""Ahhhh, so you speak the white man's tongue. I do also,"" bellowed the chief as he leaned forward in his throne. ""You were walking on our sacred burial grounds when my men found you. For this you must be punished.""

""Please, we were lost,"" said John
""I beg you, let us go,"" cried Dennis. 

""SILENCE! You will be punished by our laws. You,"" he declared pointing at Dennis. ""Death or Humma-Bumma?""

""I d-d-don't want to d-d-die,"" he chattered. ""I'll t-take Hu-hu-humma Bumma.""

""HUMMA BUMMA!"" the tribe cried as one. 

A ceremonial stump was brought out and Dennis was dragged along screaming. He was stripped naked before they bent him over the stump and tied him down. He looked in fear at John. 

""I'm s-so sorry J-J-John. Puh-puh-please forgive m-m-meeee."" said Dennis through tears. 

The six tribesmen who captured the two friends lined up behind Dennis, and one by one they sodomized him. John, clenched his eyes, but could not block out the screams of his friend. When the ass pummelling was over, Dennis was dragged away to a nearby hut, having passed out. 

The Chief spoke and pointed at John: ""You! Death or Humma Bumma?""

John, unable to willingly choose to be raped by 6 huge men, accepted his fate and held his head high. 

""I choose death,"" he said stoically.

In the interview, the manager told him that their only gorilla, which had been a star attraction, had recently been shot (some freak accident with a kid) and it would be sometime before they could replace it. Meanwhile, they needed someone to dress up as a gorilla, or the zoo could shut down. 

The biologist was quite embarrassed, but, being desperate for money, he accepted the job.
The next day, the biologist put on a gorilla skin and headgear and entered a cage from a rear entrance. 

Visitors smiled at him and threw bananas and such. After a while, the biologist really got into the act. He jumped up and down, beat his chest and roared as people cheered.

The following day, the biologist entered the wrong cage by accident and found himself staring at a lion. The lion roared and rushed toward him. The scared biologist turned and ran, while screaming, “Help! Help!” 

The lion leaped onto the gorilla, knocked him to the ground and whispered in his ear, “Hey, it’s me Leonard, your former co-worker. Shut up or we’ll both lose our jobs!”

An angel enters the room and says, ""hey guys. We've had a really busy day. A lot of good people died today and we are almost at capacity for the day. However, if you explain how you died, maybe I can make some room for you.""

The first man walks up to the angel and says, ""well it all started a few weeks ago. I was having suspicions that my wife was cheating on me and I decided today would be the day I would catch her. So, I left work a few hours early, took the elevator up to my 5th story apartment and surprised my wife. She was acting really shady but after looking all over my apartment I found no one else there. My nerves were getting to me, so I went out on the balcony for a smoke, and sure as shit, there is this guy hanging from the balcony by his finger tips! Well, I start pounding away at his hands until all his fingers broke and he let go. I thought that was going to be it, but the son of a bitch landed in a bush and lived! So in a fit of rage, I grabbed my refrigerator, and threw it over the edge on top of the guy. Unfortunately, my jacket got snagged on the handle of the fridge and I went over with it. And, well, here I am.""

The angel thinks for a second and replies, ""well, we normally frown upon things like murder, but you did find out your wife was unfaithful and that really sucks. You can come on in.""

The second man walks up to the angel and says, ""well it all started when I was having a really bad day at work today. When I'm stressed, I like to blow off steam by working out. So I left work early and went home. I took the elevator up to my 6th floor apartment and went out to my balcony where I keep my weights. After lifting for about an hour, I tripped and fell over my railing. I thought I was doomed but I managed to grab onto the balcony below me. I was hanging there for a second, but I couldn't pull myself up because my arms were so smoked from working out. I thought I was saved when this guy came out, but instead of helping me up, he broke all my fingers and I fell! Luckily, I landed in a bush and survived the fall. I thought I was okay, but then out of no where, a fridge comes falling down and lands right on my face! I guess that did me in, 'cause now I'm here.""

The angel thinks for a moment and says, ""wow, I can't believe how bad your luck is. You can come on in.""

The third man walks up to the angel and says, ""well, it all started when I was hiding in a refrigerator...""",A joke my dad used to tell my brother and me. Long but worth it IMO.,89

 The second little pig, who was an architectural design major, decided to build his out of of wood, thinking that wood was what his mother pig used to build a house and what everyone else used. 
 The third little pig majored in engineering. He decided to build his house out of steel beams.
 One day, a big bad wolf came around to the first little pig's house. He was very hungry, so he took a big bite out of the straw house and tore it down with his teeth. The little piggy was forced to flee  to his second brother's house.
 When the wolf arrived at the second little pig's house, he brought a bulldozer with him and started ripping through the house. The pigs were absolutely terrified, and they ran all the way to their big brother's house.

Now, this guy's a real asshole and thinks he can do everything right, and anyone who doesn't do it his way is wrong. So he goes into the first story, and he sees a guy walking on stilts. He says, ""That's not how you walk on stilts!"" The stilts guy gets down from his stilts, goes over, slaps him in the face and says, ""Hey, who's walking on stilts here, you or me?"" 

So the guy goes up to the second story and he sees a guy doing gymnastics. He says, ""That's not how you do gymnastics!"" So the gymnastics guy gets up, goes over, slaps him in the face and says ""Hey! Who's doing gymnastics here, you or me?""

So the guy goes up to the third story, where he sees a guy flipping pancakes. He says, ""That's not how you flip pancakes!"" So the guy takes the frying pan, goes over, slaps him in the face with it and says, ""Hey, who's flipping pancakes here, you or me?""

The once-colorful sign reads ""Psychic readings performed; $20.00 per palm reading, first question answered FREE."" The man, intrigued, decides that he could skip his usual Starbucks stop in exchange for a new experience, and pulls off to the side of the road.

As he gets out of his car, he notices a strange look about the house. First off, the house is covered in a bright purple paint which has been badly chipped from many years baking in the sun. Secondly, none of the house's openings are level: windows are cracked and crooked, and the front door is slanted to the left. And, strangely enough, there is no paved pathway to the front door; simply worn grass, then patio, then door.

Despite all of these oddities, the man proceeds to walk from his car, up the oil-stained driveway, across the path of matted-down brown grass, onto the crumbling concrete patio, and knocks on the old oak door with a resounding *thunk* *thunk*

But before the man could knock a third time, the door swung open, revealing a plump elderly lady dressed in a thick red cloak decorated many translucent pink scarves. The man is taken aback by how quickly she answered the door, especially because of how old and out of shape she apparently was.

The lady in red introduces herself as the psychic in a flamboyant, yet obviously rehearsed way:

""I am the psychic of Piccadilly Lane!""

She continues, pointing at the man ""You have come to have your future seen, your misfortunes foretold, and your successes predicted!""

The man, still a little confused by the woman's quickness at answering the door, is actually impressed by the psychic's act, assuring himself that this was going to be far more entertaining than his planned trip to Starbucks.

The psychic then proceeds to calmly invite the man into her home, and he follows. Decidedly, the inside of the psychic's home is far stranger than the outside. Bookcases line the walls with literature written in many different languages: Latin, English, Greek, French, and even a few the man was unable to identify. Sitting atop the bookcases are dusty knick-knacks ranging from snow globes and creepy red-fabric dolls to broken crystal balls and a cuckoo clock the man swears is running backwards.

He follows the lady into a warm and poorly-lit room draped in cotton and lace curtains. In the center is a card table covered with an elaborately-weaved purple and gold tablecloth. On the table is a glowing crystal ball sitting atop a beautifully engraved wooden bowl. The engravings show scenes of both erotic pleasure and horrible torture that the man hopes are symbolic for life rather than his own personal future. He is then directed to one of two deeply tan leather chairs parked on either side of the table. After both the Psychic and the man sat down, she addresses the man:

""Sir, as you may have read up front, I can see the answer to any question you pose me, and I answer the first question free of charge. So, think deeply about what you wish to ask.""

The man, after a few seconds, speaks to the psychic: ""So I can ask you any question and you will answer it?""

""Yes, to the best of my ability""

The man nods, satisfied, and leaves.",A Trip to the Psychic of Piccadilly Lane,6

Back on January 9th, a group of Wadesboro, North Carolina bikers were riding east on Hwy.74 
when they saw a girl about to jump off the Pee Dee River Bridge. So ...they stopped.
George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers,
past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says,

""Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railing'?""
 
She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""
 
While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" George also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked . . .
 
""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . .why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?""
 
So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . .
and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.
 
After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, 
the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, 
 
""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. 
You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""
 
""My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.""  
 
It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.",Last kiss,265

Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.


The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.


Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.


Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.

post,4m0vl6,2qh72,jokes,false,1464782236,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4m0vl6/chum_the_sheep/,self.jokes,,"There was this young man who had had enough of city life so he moves to the country and decides to run a sheep farm.  He educated himself as much as he could on how to run a farm.  He bought a farm, and buys a heard of sheep.  Everything is going well, the sheep are properly housed and fed.  The sheep are all grazing and seem fit all season.  But when it came to sheering the sheep something went horribly wrong, the sheep's wool was coming out all tough and stringy.  When the young man tried to sell the wool he was told it was worthless.  A buyer examined the wool and asked;

""Did you chum the sheep?""

The young man had no idea what the buyer meant.  He figured it was just some slang he never heard before for feeding and grazing the sheep.  The buyer said the wool was worthless and he had to throw it away.  To recover some of his loss the young farmer decided to slaughter some of the sheep.  So he took a few sheep to the butcher who said;

""The meat on these sheep is tough to the bone.  It's worthless.  Did you chum the sheep?""  

And young man had no idea what the butcher meant so he asked what chumming the sheep meant.  

""To fuck it, of course,"" said the butcher.  

The young man was shocked and said the butcher was kidding.  The butcher didn't smile at all and was dead serious.  

""You gotta chum the sheep lad,"" said the butcher, ""If you don't chum the sheep, the sheep get upset and the wool comes out all stringy.  The meat gets too tough to eat.""

The young man said even if he could fuck the sheep he couldn't possibly fuck the whole heard.  The butcher said relax, he could hire a professional sheep chummer.  Everyone in the county hired sheep chummers.  So the young farmer asked how much it cost to hire professional sheep chummer.  $20/hour.  That seemed steep to the young farmer, but the butcher said.

""They're from Wales, lad, that's the most they can afford to pay ye,"" said the butcher.

So the young farmer calls a sheep chummer who shows up the next day, an old man from Wales.  

""Aye, I'm here to chum the sheep,"" he said.  

So the young farmer points out the heard and the old man has at it.  He chummed the whole heard in just over two hours.  All of a sudden the sheep's wool was vastly improved, the butcher said the meat was as tender as he ever saw.  The young farmer as astonished how effective it was and he asked the butcher when did people discover sheep chumming was so effective?  The butcher said it was shortly after people from Wales discovered two brand new uses for sheep.  

""What was that?"" asked the young farmer.  

""Wool and meat,"" said the butcher.

The bus was full of all kinds of top athletes; NBA, NFL, NHL, you name it.  It was a regular party bus, and they were cruising along at a pretty good clip, partying and whooping it up.

Unbeknownst to the driver, another bus was headed towards them at a high rate of speed.  This was a prison bus, full of criminals of the worst sort, who had just overpowered their driver and were headed at top speed away from the Vegas area into the desert.  As you can imagine they weren't driving too carefully, on account of being a bunch of wanted escapees, and as fate would have it they lost control of the bus and jumped the median just as they were passing the sports bus.

It was a horrible accident.  Both buses exploded, body parts went everywhere.  When the local rural sheriff arrived, he was just overwhelmed at the amount of carnage.  They were still a good hour outside of Vegas, and there was hardly any medical examiner or funeral home around that could possible take care of this giant mess of humanity. 

However, the sheriff did recall that the nearby town had a semi private medical examiner / funeral director who also ran a junk removal business on the side.  Desperate for a solution, the sheriff gave him a ring.  

""Hmmm,"" the man said after hearing a description of the scene. ""Well I can possibly bring the junk truck, but here's the deal - when I'm acting a a funeral director, I get paid by the body.  And when I'm doing junk removal, I get paid by the pound.  So it sound like you've just got a mess of body parts out there that will be hard to sort through.  I dunno, I may lose money taking this job.  Let me talk it over with my wife.""

So the man turns to his wife, who ran the business, and asked her what she thought - was it worth it to take this job by the pound instead of by the body?

""Well, honey,"" the wife says, ""we'll figure it out.  By the pound will probably work out fine.  We just have to carefully weigh the pros and cons....""",A terrible bus crash in the Nevada desert,1

Satan quickly introduces himself. ""Welcome to Hell. I can't say i was expecting you, so i guess St. Peter made a mistake when he put you on the Hell list. I'll have one of my demons phone him right away. In the mean time, well, there isn't much, but if you want to amuse yourself, i can help you with that.""

The engineer thinks for a moment, and then says, ""You know, it is extremely hot down here. I'd love to build a large AC unit. Do you have the materials?""

Satan says, ""Well, yes, we have all manners of metals due to our location under the Earth's crust. Have at it.""

The engineer, after 3 days of heavy work, finishes his Hell-wide AC and turns it on. After 3 hours, the temperature has finally reached a more desirable 78 degrees, and Hell is much less hellish. Satan is highly impressed. ""Nice work, i didn't think this was even possible! Sorry to say, though, St. Peter refuses to admit he messed up. Since you made this AC happen, I'll let you do whatever you want.""

The engineer thinks, and says, ""You now it's also really dark and dim with just the lava flows. Have the materials for a lighting system?"" Satan says, ""Of course! God sent some heavenly light once but i never could figure out how it worked. Here's the instructions.""

2 days later, the heavenly light had been configured to brightly light Hell. Productivity was way up and now Hell was not so bad anymore. Satan tells the engineer, ""I like you, bud! Tell you what, you can live like a king. Got a room in my castle for you. Everything you could ever want is there.""

At this point, several angels had reviewed the engineer's life and informed God of St. Peter's mistake. God hastily adds the engineer to the Heaven list. He calls Satan and asks for the engineer.

Satan says, ""No way, man! Hell has never been so nice before him. We have lighting, cooling, and now he's tinkering with machines that haven't worked since your son went to Earth! I'm keeping him.""

God immediately responds, ""He is a good man, though! He belongs in Heaven. It is only right! If you will not return him, I'll have to take you to court.""

Satan laughs, and says, ""Oh, and just where will you find a lawyer?""",An engineer went to Hell...,5

The Cardinal replied, ""No. I don't really like the man, and there are issues of conflict with the Catholic Church over certain of Obama's views.

That night he sneaks round to the camel, makes sure it is securely tied so it can't turn on him, climbs onto a wooden box, drops his trousers and fucks the camel. Feeling disgusted with himself, he skulks back to his tent.

Jean Jacques is humiliated, now the whole company knows of his weakness and perversion.

He was working at a dead-end job, had few friends, and spent far too much time alone at home watching netflix and surfing the net. He'd work all day, drink all night, and do it again the next day.

Over time, things got worse and worse, and then one morning after an especially heavy bender, he slept through his alarm, and showed up to work late and hungover, and his boss fired him on the spot.

""Maybe this could be an opportunity,"" one of his friends said. ""You hated that job anyway - maybe this is your chance to follow your dream.""

The poop thought about this, and decided that yes - he was going to turn his life around, leave this podunk town, and travel to Hollywood, California, and become a great actor.

He sold enough of his belongings to afford a ticket to California, and left the next day with nothing but the shirt on his back. 

When he arrived in Los Angeles, he got straight to work looking for auditions. He tried out for every part he could find, but no one cast him. He went from studio to studio looking for something - anything - but the casting directors simply weren't interested in hiring a piece of poop.

As the days went by, the rejection was beginning to wear on him, as he was only eating what scraps he could find, and was sleeping outside only long enough for the cops to tell him to move along.

It was about a week later, and the piece of poop was at the only studio he had yet to try, hoping even for just a part as a background extra. Anything to get his foot in the door.

When the casting director saw him, she wouldn't even listen to his audition - she just said they weren't interested.

The poop had had enough. ""Not interested? Let me tell you what I'M not interested in. I'm not interested in breaking. I'm not interested in giving up on my dreams. I'm not interested in accepting that I'm not worthy because of what I look like, and I'm not interested in going back to a life I hated because you're too closed-minded to see GREATNESS when it's staring you in the face!""

The casting director was just about to call security, when there was a knock on the door.

""Excuse me,"" said the man at the door, ""I was walking by, and couldn't help overhearing. It's been a long time since I've seen anyone with this much passion. You have something special, kid - I think you have the potential to be one of the real greats in this business.""

""Who are you?"" asked the poop.

""I'm the President of Movies,"" said the man. ""and I'm about to make you a star.""

The poop went along with the president down to his limo, and the two did lunch to discuss what sort of projects would be best to collaborate on. The poop had some great ideas, and the president knew just the people to bring in to make them happen.

The poop's first film was a blockbuster hit. The second was even bigger. The third became the highest grossing movie in history. Everyone in America fell in love with Hollywood's newest A-lister.

But so much fame so fast went to the poop's head. He started getting in to the celebrity part lifestyle, drinking, doing coke... The paparazzi began following him around to see if he'd do something crazy.

Then one night a young man approached the poop while he was out partying at the club.

""Yo, I'm a huge fan. Can you sign my DVD?"" the young man asked.

""Beat it, kid, can't you see I'm trying to snort coke off this stripper's ass?"" said the poop.

""What the hell? It'll only take a second. Come on, sign it!""

""I said GET OUT OF MY FACE!"" yelled the poop. A crowd began to gather around as the paparazzi snapped photos left and right.

""You know what, poop? Get flushed!"" the young man said as he picked up a glass of water and threw it at the poop.

And that's when the shit hit the fan.",Did you hear about the poop that went to Hollywood to become an actor?,0

He's doing tons of doughnuts to pass the time. Suddenly, his car stops. Jake checks and realizes that he's out of gas. And nowhere near civilization. And without water.

Realizing he needs liquids for the trek ahead of him, so he searches his car for something. The only thing he finds is his poisonous windshield wiper fluid. To at least have something, Jake decides to take it with him.

And then the journey begins.

So he walks...

And walks...

And walks...

Eventually, he gets too exhausted to walk, so he crawls...

And crawls...

And crawls...

And crawls...

Dehydrated from the blazing desert heat, he gives in to his reflexes and drinks the windshield wiper fluid.

It didn't help.

So he continued to crawl...

And crawl...

And crawl...

But then, as he thought he couldn't crawl anymore, he sees the strangest thing in his entire life: a snake wrapped around a large upright stick.

Bewildered, he approached the reptile.

Then, the snake speaks to Jake:

""Hello, I am Nate, Guardian of the Lever. If the lever is pulled, the entire universe, everything in it, and all life will come to an end. I was told that the next person who approaches would be the new Guardian of the Lever, and I was to grant him three wishes to reward him for accepting this noble task.""

Jake processes the extreme responsibility bestowed upon him, and gladly accepts his new role. He begins with his first wish:

""First, make me healthy. I am simultaneously dying of windshield wiper poisoning and dehydration.""

And Nate obeyed; with a swish of his tail, Jake was cured.

""Second, get me out of this desert. While the Lever is great, I want to go home.""

Nate replies, ""Before I grant your second wish, what is your third wish?""

Jake ponders this, and finally decides, ""I want all of the wisdom in the entire universe. I want to understand how to be successful and live life to the fullest.""

And then Nate granted both of Jake's wishes, bringing him back home with new knowledge.

With this knowledge, Jake became very wealthy. He bought a beautiful house with an amazing view, started a family, and sold an extremely successful start-up.

However, Jake knew of his responsibility, and would often go to see his good friend Nate, who still lived by the Lever because he had been there for so long.

On one of his trips to visit Nate, Jake takes a new car through the desert. After a distance, Jake sees the Lever, a cliff, and Nate. Jake decides to stop the car and reaches to brake, but he unfortunately bought his car from the wrong person, for the brakes weren't working. Jake analyzes the situation. If he keeps going straight, he'll plummet off of a cliff. If he turns left, he'll hit the Lever which will end the entire universe, everything in it, and all life. If he turns right, he'll crush his good friend Nate.

Jake knows the correct decision.

He turns right and kills his good friend Nate.

Jake then exclaims, ""Better Nate than Lever!""",Jake is driving in the desert...,129

There was a baby male buffalo (around 10 years old or so), a daddy buffalo and a mommy buffalo. The baby buffalo attended the local elementary school and the parents were respected members of the neighborhood and both had pretty decent jobs, but life was still rough and at times the family found themselves barely scraping by, sometimes not even. Now, as the buffalo family lived in a rough neighborhood, drugs were very common and the parents, during a period of mental distress, were introduced to heroin by one of their friends. At first it was a casual thing, they'd shoot maybe once a week or so to take the edge off, but over time what was once a weekend vice spiraled into crippling addiction, and it got to the point where they both lost their jobs, and would do anything they could to support their fix, and this meant sometimes selling their son for sex. When the son protested, the parents would beat him, but in places where people couldn't see, such as the back, stomach and legs. The parents would often resort to beating the baby buffalo whenever anything happened that upset them, regardless of how irrational or little the present issue had to do with their son. After about 4 months of this behavior, one of the baby buffalo's teachers noticed him limping and wincing in pain every time he moved, so she inquired and upon finding out about the situation, called Child Protective Services. CPS launches an investigation and (miraculously..) are able to jail the parents and they tell the child that he will be placed in foster care. In the last fleeting moments that all three are under the same roof, as the parents are being dragged past their child and out of the house, they find themselves confused, realizing all they have done. Finding themselves near speechless, they struggle to mutter their last words to their child:

""Um, Peter, I have a question; what's with all the clocks?""
""Oh, well, everyone on Earth has a clock. Each time you masturbate, the hands on the clock moves.""
Turning red-faced, you ask ""Which one belongs to me?""
""Yours is right there"", Peter says, ""Don't worry, yours moves as much as anyone elses"".

Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. 

""Picture this,"" says the third man, ""I'm hiding inside a refrigerator...""
