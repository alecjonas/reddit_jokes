He notices, however, that all of the monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript. So, the new monk goes to the Old Abbot to question this, pointing out that if someone made even an error in the first copy, it would never be picked up! In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.

The head monk, says, “We have been copying from the copies for centuries, but you make a good point, my son.”

He goes down into the dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are held as archives, in a locked vault that hasn’t been opened for hundreds of years.

Hours go by and nobody sees the Old Abbot. So, the young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him banging his head against the wall and wailing.

“We missed the R! We missed the R! We missed the bloody R!”
His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying uncontrollably.
The young monk asks the old Abbot, “What’s wrong, father?”

With a choking voice, the old Abbot replies,

“The word was—CELEBRATE!”

When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs. Half-way up the stairs though, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his back. That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke; the broken glass carved up his back terribly. Yet, he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt.  

A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood, so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up terribly. He then repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed.  

The next morning, his head was hurting, his back was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom.  

""Well, you really tied one on last night,"" she said. ""Where'd you go?""  

""I worked late,"" he said, ""and I stopped off for a couple of beers.""

""Well,"" said the hiker, ""I've been wandering for days, trying to find a way off the mountains. I've had no luck, though... I'm hopelessly lost.""

Not one to refuse an offer like this, the hiker goes inside. Later that evening, Brother Singh brings him to the feast. The first thing the hiker notices when he arrives is that some of the monks are standing up, saying numbers, and then the monks all burst out laughing.

""Brother Singh, why is it that everyone is cracking up at these numbers?"" he asks.

""You see, all the monks here are only allowed to speak on one day each year - that day is today. They also love to tell jokes, so we numbered the jokes so that we can save time telling them all. You should give it a try!""

After contemplating for a moment, the hiker stands up and says ""372.""

The joke revolves around the fact that ""Dah-Rah Beer"" sounds like ""Dollar Bill"" in a comically racist stereotypical Asian accent. 

So I was thinking of something along the lines of a long setup involving a story about the rise and fall of the Dah-Rah brewing company in an Asian/Oriental country and the punch line involving an Asian person trying to order a Dah-Rah Beer in a non Asian country and being told basically ""piss off, we don't give out free money here"".

The set up would have to avoid actually saying ""Dah-Rah Beer"" until the punch line so as to not give it away early. 

I'm having a hard time putting the peices together in a way that doesn't suck.

was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a 
slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said 
he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with 
carrying weapons of math instruction. ""Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,"" Gonzales said. They desire average 
solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value.
They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as unknowns, but we have determined 
they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. 
As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, ""There are 3 sides to every triangle.""
When asked to comment on the arrest, a TSA employee obtusely said, ""If God had wanted us to have better 
weapons of math instruction, he would have given us more fingers and toes.""Tomorrow I intend to go to 
the hill and address Congruence about this situation. I have a volume of suggestions and a finite series 
of common solutions for them to consider.” The President then warned, “These weapons of math instruction 
are without parallel and have the potential to decimal everything on a scalene never before seen unless 
we become exponents of an infinity Higher Power and begin to factor-in random facts of kindness. If we 
enter a phase in which all nations are integrated in all degrees of purpose, that steady state will give 
us slope for a better tomorrow, and we will all be infinitely better off. In such a case we could have 
our pi and eat it too.” The President further declared, “I am gratified that we have been given a sine 
that al-Gebra is protracting this situation with calculusing disregard. Their murky statisticians plan 
to inflict plane of new dimensions on every sphere of influence,” he added. “Under these circumferences, 
we must differentiate their roots, make our points, draw our lines, and proportionally intersect these 
people throughout whatever area of the domain they range. And, above all, we must make sure that they 
can’t get their hands on radii active materials. That is one thing you can secant. What we need is a higher 
quotient of linguists embedded with our troops so that they can interpolate the gibberish that al-Gebra 
uses to communicate. If we had that capability, we could periodically reach new limits of success as 
easily as falling off a natural log. Anything short of that could lead to some real, not imaginary, 
complex circumstances.” The Secretary of Homeland Security added, “As our Great Leader would say, 
‘Read my ellipse.’ The one angle that I am uncertainty of is that although al-Gebra will probability try 
to continuously multiply in theorem, their days are numbered as we draw the hypotenuse ever tighter 
around their necks.”",A man was arrested at Kennedy Airport today...,0

The ride is going well until the horse gets spooked by some shadows and comes to an instant stop, jostling the lovebirds a little. The man is annoyed by this and gives the horse a hard smack on the back of it's head saying ""horse, that's 1"". His new wife finds this a little strange and asks what that was about but he only replied she needn't worry about it.
An hour passes and everything is going good until some rocks fall a little ways ahead and scare the horse worse than the first time, almost throwing the newlyweds off. The man is far more annoyed than the first time so he gets off the horse and punches it as hard as he can in the face and says ""horse, that's 2"". The woman is slightly more concerned now and asks what he meant. Again the husband replies not to worry about it.
Some more time passes and the weather turns a bit and the sky goes dark. There's a loud clap of thunder from the distance and this really scares the horse who rears up on it's hind legs throwing the riders off, but thankfully no one was hurt. The man is furious now though. He pulls out a revolver he's carrying, walks to the horse and says "" horse, that's fucking three"" and shoots the horse in the head. 
The woman sees all this and starts freaking out. She's hysterical, screaming and crying, calling him all sorts of names. The man walks over to her, puts a hand on her shoulder, looks in her eyes, and proceeds to give her the hardest slap of her life saying ""woman, that's 1.",A man and woman on their honeymoon,0

• 2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman

• 2 French men and 1 French woman

• 2 German men and 1 German woman

• 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman

• 2 English men and 1 English woman

• 2 Bulgarian men and 1 Bulgarian woman

• 2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman

• 2 Chinese men and 1 Chinese woman

• 2 American men and 1 American woman

• 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman

One month later on these same absolutely stunning deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred:

One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.

The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a menage-a-trois.

The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating visits with the German woman.

The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.

The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman.

The two Bulgarian men took one long look at the endless ocean, and another long look at the Bulgarian woman, and started swimming.

The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions.

The two Chinese men have set up a pharmacy, a liquor store, a restaurant and a laundry, and have got the woman pregnant in order to supply employees for their stores.

The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide because the American woman keeps endlessly complaining about her body; the true nature of feminism; how she can do everything they can do; the necessity of
fulfillment; the equal division of household chores; how sand and palm trees make her look fat; how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her nicer than they do; how her relationship with her mother is improving and how at least the taxes are low and it isn't raining.

The two Irish men have divided the island into North and South and set up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few litres of coconut whisky. But they're satisfied because at least the English aren't having any fun.",Two Men And A Woman From Different Countries Get Stranded...,104

Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.

Soon the church was empty except for one elderly cowboy who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.

So Satan walked up to the man and said, 'Do you know who I am?'

The old cowboy replied, 'Yep, sure do.'

'Aren't you afraid of me?' Satan asked.

'Nope sure ain't.' said the cowboy.

'Don't you realize I can kill you with one word?' asked Satan.

'Don't doubt it for a minute.' returned the old man, in an even tone.

'Did you know that I can cause you profound, horrifying AGONY for all eternity?' persisted Satan.

'Yep.' was the calm reply.

'And you still are not afraid?' asked Satan.

After many gruelling tests, only four remained. They were NYPD, Scotland Yard, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and *Dilli* (Delhi) Police. The final test is to find the winner of the contest.

The test is simple. A lion is to be released into the forest. Whoever catches it the quickest is the winner. 

First NYPD starts. The lion is released. NYPD officers follow it into the jungle. After a couple of hours they are back with the lion in ropes.

Next the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a go. The lion is released and they follow it on horseback. In an hour they are back, with the lion in tow.

Scotland Yard goes next and they are even faster. They get the animal back in half an hour.

Last but not least, *Dilli* Police's turn comes. The lion is released and four mustachioed *Sardars* carrying *Lathis* (bamboo sticks) chase after him in a Jeep. The time passes and the organizers look on. An hour goes by, then two and then five, but they do not return. So the people in-charge go into the jungle to investigate. They drive for a long time through the dense foliage. After some time, they start hearing shrieks and screams close-by. They head towards the sound. They reach a clearing and what they see astounds them. The *Dilli* Police have a Bear tied to a tree and are beating it with their *Lathis* and screaming *""Bol tu sher hai""* (""Confess that you are a Lion"").

The men of the neighbourhood looked and saw their new neighbour having a BBQ. They looked at their fish but remained stoic and ate their regularly scheduled meal.

However, this kept going on - Friday after Friday the neighbour cooked a BBQ while they ate fish. They got together to determine what to do about this problem. One man had the genius idea they convert the newcomer to Catholicism and then he would have to settle into the same tradition.

So, they set about becoming best friends, watching sports, mowing lawns, socialising and the like. The new neighbour was so moved by these efforts at friendship that he agreed to convert to their religious views.

He attended a Catholic church where the Priest splashed him with water, ""You were born a Protestant"" (splash) ""You were raised a Protestant"" (splash) ""You are a Catholic."" The men were pleased and figured this was the end of their troubles.

Next Friday as they settled down to eat fish they again smelled a delicious steak sizzling nearby. They looked out their windows, and there was the neighbour at his BBQ with a small bowl of water ... ""You were born a cow"" (splash) ""You were raised a cow"" (splash) ""You are a fish.""",Religious traditions,31

Soon, it died completely and they were stranded on the side of a state highway with little traffic.

Fortunately, a pick up truck pulled over to help. The driver was a comely middle aged woman in jeans and a work shirt. She told them the closest town with a mechanic was 60 miles away, and since it was past 5:00 pm they would be closed anyway until the next day.

In a gesture of Texas hospitality, she invited them to stay the night at her ranch which was nearby. Then they could call the garage in town to get their car fixed in the morning.

The two salesmen were very appreciative, and climbed into the pickup with her.

Soon they turned into a gate, and began driving through a lovely farm where cattle were grazing behind neatly built fences. As they drove she told them how she and her late husband had run this farm for years before he had died from a heart attack two years ago. Now it was just her running things, and it got lonely out here so she was glad for the chance to have guests.

Before long they pulled up to a very nice ranch house surrounded by a white fence and with a big barn nearby. 


Once inside, the widow rancher made them comfortable on the big front porch and brought them cold iced tea before proceeding inside to cook a delicious home cooked meal for them. After dinner they chatted in the living room for a few hours before she showed them to the guest bedroom where they found a comfortable bed with down pillows and a homemade quilt.

In the morning the widow made them an enormous breakfast while they waited for the tow truck to come collect their car. 


When the wrecker came, they bid the kind widow a fond farewell and she sent them on their way with a bag of cookies for later.

Soon their car was repaired and they were on their way again.

About nine months had passed when one of the salesman called the other.

""Bob, do you remember about nine months ago when our car broke down in West Texas?""

""Yes, Ted. I remember that.""

""And Bob, do you remember that very kindly widow that took us in for the night?""

""Well of course I remember her Ted.""

""Well Bob, I have to ask you something.""

""Ok Ted.""

""Bob, did you slip out of the guest room that night?""

Yes Ted, I did.""

""And Bob, did you go to the widow's room that night?""

""I did Ted.""

""Did you and the widow make love Bob?""

""Yes, we did Ted""

""Now Bob, this is very important. Did you by chance use MY name that night when you slept with her?""

""I did Ted. I'm ashamed of myself, but I did. I'm really, really sorry Ted....""

""Oh, that's ok Bob. I just wanted to call and let you know that she died and left me the ranch in her will.""

The pastor tells the man that if he needs money that the church would gladly help him out. The man refused the charity and tells the pastor that he would rather earn his money. The pastor thinks for a moment and tells the man that the only job that they have open at the church is the bell ringer. The man tells the pastor that he could easily do the job as the bell ringer and would do it for the upcoming days service. 

   Although the pastor had his doubts, the pastor leads the man to the bell tower. Once there, the pastor demonstrates how to ring the bell. The pastor grabs the rope with both hands and pulls down, ringing the bell. The man stated ""no problem"" and proceeds to run head first into the bell, which produces a loud ringing. The pastor although surprised by the method, tells the man he has the job, and that he must go prepare for the church service. He tells the man to ring the bell ten more times. The man with no arms then proceeds to run head first into the bell two more times, but then starts to feel groggy and falls out of the bell tower onto the pavement in front of the church, just as the parishioners begin to show up to church. The parishioners gather around the man, but nobody recognizes him. 

The pastor then comes up to the crowd, and one of the parishioners asks the pastor if they recognize the man, the pastor replies ""the face rings a bell.""",Man without arms,5

Back in the 1950s, there were a lot of folks who thought so. Mel Famey of the Milwaukee Braves was a natural .. a once-in-a-lifetime phenom whose fast ball blew away the best hitters. His 90 MPH curveball would start out like it was going to hit the batter's ear, only to break at the last instant and hit the outside corner of the plate for a strike. His changeup made the best hitters in the league cry .. they would swing, drop the bat, and stare increduously as the ball hit the catcher's mitt. He was indeed awesome!

Why then, you might ask, is he not in the Hall of Fame? Why haven't you ever heard of him? Alas, like many others before him, Mel's downfall was .. alcohol. Ol' Mel really liked to tilt the glass. His drinking became almost legendary around the country, but he never let it affect his pitching until ... this happened.

The Braves and the Yankees in the World Series! Excitement reigned! The series was tied at three games apiece, and the Braves were in New York for the seventh and deciding game. The night before the big event, Mel's thirst got the better of him. He snuck out of the hotel after curfew, and bought himself two cases of beer. As you might imagine, the next morning Mel didn't feel too good. But being the pro that he was, Mel managed to do just fine .. until the bottom of the ninth inning. With the Braves ahead by one run, two out and the bases loaded, Mel's revelry the night before finally caught up to him. Eight straight pitches .. eight straight balls. He walked in the tieing and the winning runs, losing the game and the series.

After the game, a reporter went to the jubilant Yankee's clubhouse and spoke to the last two players that faced Mel. ""Tell me,"" he asked, ""to what do you attribute this victory over the best pitcher in the major leagues?""

In unison they replied, ""It was the beer that made Mel Famey walk us!""",A Baseball Tale,0

Unparalleled in all of man's creation, and unrivaled in nature, the conic beauty of the umbrella has become iconic in my heart.


I have wanted to work at an umbrella factory for years because of my deep rooted interest in them.


As a young student in university, I finally was able to articulate to my parents my most intimate desire for not just a job, or a career--I was able to expound my calling to my parents.


Initially there was silence.


My parents looked at me with quizzical expressions illuminating their thoughts within.


First, my father spoke.


""KezMetch, I don't think you should spend so much energy focusing on a dark thing.""

My mother spoke next.


""Son...""

but my  father began again:

""I just don't think you should do that. I spent time around umbrella makers when I was your age.""


My ears perked up.


""They were not nice people, KezMetch. They were of poor character. In fact, their business was run by evil. Like a gang.""


My mother nodded gently, in agreement.


""I think..."" she then looked at her husband for reassurance. ""I think, what your father is tying to say, is that...the umbrella makers were in a shady business.""

**TLDR** it's a shady business",I hope to work at an umbrella factory.,3

I ate 5 bowls of cereal for breakfast and drank 5 cups of coffee

I went for a 5 mile jog to clear my head

I dressed in the 5th suit I found in my closet

He decided that he hadn't gone since he was a kid, so he'd go to this one for old time's sake.

On the day of, he decided that he'd wear the new shirt he'd bought, a very comfy pink sweater, and every act of the show was amazing.

About halfway into the show, however, they dimmed the lights in the tent, and a spotlight started roaming through the audience while one of the clowns watched. When the spotlight moved past our pink-shirted friend, the clown yelled out to stop, and immediately started making fun of the sweater. It got so bad that the guy got up out of his seat, and left in tears.

When he got home, he vowed that if the same circus came into town again, he'd be prepared and wouldn't let it happen again. So he began to look up information on clowns. He searched online, went to libraries, and found clown groups on social media to ask questions from.

Still not satisfied though, he decided he needed a more hands-on approach, so he enrolled in clown college, and after two years of mind-numbing research, projects, and tests, came away with his degree and the highest honours.

At the end of his course, for being one of the top three students, he was offered a spot in one of the most prestigious institutes, to continue his studies and learn more about the origins of clowning, and also of offshoots like miming. He accepted, and spent another grueling five years becoming a master clown.

Finally, upon completing his studies, he went back home exhausted, but proud of his accomplishments. He knew now that he'd be ready. And sure enough, only a few months later on his way to work again, there was another billboard for the same circus, this time with a picture of the same clown who had ridiculed him.

This was his moment to shine. His years of preparation were finally about to pay off. So he put on the exact same pink sweater, and made his way to the circus.

Again about halfway through the show, they started shining the spotlight around the tent, and again the clown yelled out to stop on the pink sweater.

""Didn't get enough last time we were in town?"" The clown asked with a laugh. ""You want me to make sure you leave crying again?""

That was when the guy stood up, brimming with confidence, and thinking back to his years of learning and training, and said ""You know what? Fuck you.""",The circus was in town...,0

After what seemed like a few minutes, the chicken walked up to the counter with good size stack of books. The Chicken put them on the counter and, while pointing to each book, said: 

""Bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak"" 

Puzzled, I decided to ask the chicken for its library card and sure enough the chicken gave it to me. The chicken took the checked out books and then left the library. 

The next day, the same chicken came back, put all the books into the return slot, and walked up to my desk with a larger stack of books. The chicken then, while pointing to each book, said: 

""Bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak""

Confused, I took the chicken's library card and checked out said books. The chicken then left the library carrying the larger stack of books. 

The next day, the chicken came in with all the books, put all of them into the return slot and, after ten minutes, came back with an even larger stack of books. The chicken put the books on the counter and, while pointing to each book, said:

""Bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak""

I took the chicken's library card and checked out all the books. The chicken, now staggering under the weight of all the books, left the library. 

Curious about what is going on, I left my post for few minutes and started to follow the chicken. I followed the chicken down to the creek when the chicken had sat the books down in front of a frog who sat on a nearby lily pad. The chicken then pointed at all the books and said: 

""Bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak bwak""

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.'

This being a big event, the girl tells her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and ""do it"" for the first time. Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never done it before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some protection. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about protection and doing it. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many he'd like to buy; a 3-pack, a 10-pack, or a family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be very busy, it being his first time and all. That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parent's house and meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in."" The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy still deep in prayer with his head down. Ten minutes pass and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to her boyfriend, ""I had no idea you were so religious."" The boy turns and whispers back, ""I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.""

Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator. Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, and he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, rope in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her.

Completely amazed, the shopkeeper got out of his car and walked toward the young lady.

So two department store security guards are discussing their fetishes, and, through the discussions both come to find out they are both seriously into womens feat, mostly due to the fact that they have access to dressing room cameras that allow them to see the calves and feet of all of the women as they change. Thus prompting them to establish elaborate sexual fantasies around the woman and what they can pick up from their lower legs, if they paint their toenails, their shoes, their calluses, how toned their calves are from their athleticism, etc. One day they both go into the monitor room and see the most beautiful pair of legs they have ever seen and collectively articulate a grand romantic fantasy that they wish to be a part of with the woman they belong to. Eventually they become so infatuated that one says he is going to ask her out, and leaves to go talk to her, but first decided to rub one out for clarity. When he comes back from the bathroom he sees that his colleague has gathered his courage and has already started knocking on the dressing room stall. ""Excuse me mam' could I speak to you for a second?"" he says. ""What is the meaning of this?"" replys a deep, male voice.

""Um, sir?""

""Yes?""

""If you are in fact a 'sir', then you can't be in here, this is the ladies dressing room.""

""Oh my god! This is so embarrassing! I will get out of here as soon as I can!""

The man fully clothes himself in a heartbeat and exits the room, apologizing profusely: ""...and again I am terribly sorry I was not in there for anything other than my utter ineptitude, please don't take it the wrong way.""

""Oh, it's not a problem, happens to the best of us.""

""So, what did you want to see me about?"" inquired the man.

""What?""

""you know, why were you in there originally?""

""Well...""

""And why did you call me 'mam?""

I showed up to school a bit late this morning because I got way too high (forgot about the power of wake n bakes). It was towards the end of 2nd period, which I have free, so I went straight to the cafeteria. Told my friends what happened and they congratulated me on winning the school raffle (I missed the morning announcements). So now I'm real stoked because the prize was a giant gummy bear, so I headed straight to the office to collect my prize at a [4]. I had eye drops in and I changed before school so I wasn't worried at all. While I was waiting outside the principle's office I realized that I never bought a raffle ticket. I figured maybe someone bought one in my name or something until I remembered it's april fool's day. I let out a small chuckle and was about to get up and leave when the door opens behind me and the principle says ""what can I do for ya?""
Me:[very nervously] Oh, um... nevermind. My friends played an april fools joke on me I'm just gonna head back to class.
Principle: haha ok, you're not high are you?
Me:[FUUUUCKKKKK] What? No just really tired
Principle: Oh OK nevermind, have a good day
What makes it even worse is during my walk of shame back to the cafeteria I realized we don't even have a school raffle.

-----------------------------

I showed up to work at 5:45 like usual. The previous night I baked some brownies and brought two of them along for work today. I figured it was April Fools so there'd be pranks and it would be real fun. Why not get a little stoned? Anyways, I get to my office and there's this frickin' massive ass gummy bear on my desk. I ignored it for a while, because I figured it was a prank of some kind. It was towards the end of 2nd period and the munchies were kicking in hard. At this point I was straight surfing at a [6] or so, but I made sure I had eye drops in so nobody suspected that I was high. I had to suppress the munchies, so I started tearing down on this fruity, chewy, ursidae. I was sitting there eating when I heard someone outside the door. I was FREAKING out, I thought someone figured out I was high or something so as calm as possible I open the door to find this kid sitting in the chairs outside my door and I say ""h-how can I help ya""
Kid: Oh, um... nevermind. My friends played an april fools joke on me I'm just gonna head back to class.
Me being a stoned idiot asks him..
Me: haha ok, hey you're not high are you?
Kid: What? No just really tired
Me: Oh haha OK nevermind, have a good day
So he walks off and I'm all like, what the fuck dude. Then I realized what happened. The gummy bear was a prize for the stupid raffle we had that day. I told the staff not to have it on the first, but they did it anyway. Now I'm sitting here wondering if he's going to come back, and what I do if he does.",A joke from two points of view,1

Two Mexicans are riding a bicycle on a road about 15 miles outside of Lafayette , LA. One of the bike's tires goes flat and they start hitching a lift back into town.  A friendly trucker stops to see if he can help and the Mexicans ask him for a ride. He tells them they can ride in the trailer if they could fit in with 20,000 bowling balls he is hauling.
 
They manage to squeeze themselves and their bike into the back and the driver shuts the doors and gets on his way. Wanting to make up time the trucker speeds up.  Sure enough a blonde cop pulls him over for speeding. The officer asks the driver what he is carrying, to which the driver jokingly replies ""Mexican eggs.""
 
The Blond Lady Cop obviously doesn't believe this so she takes a look in the trailer. She opens the back door and shocked, quickly shuts it and locks it.  She calls for immediate backup from headquarters, the Border Patrol and the Swat Team.  The dispatcher asks what emergency she has that requires so many officers.

Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:

You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.

Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.

He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample, and deposited the $10.

The computer made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.

Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins.

Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.

Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

Once he reached home, he headed for the first bar he could find. He walked in, with the duck under his arm and asked for a whiskey. The barman, a little perplexed asked him what was the story with the duck and the springs. The guy replied

The next morning the man walks in and asks about the pets. The shopkeeper gives him a monkey and says ""your house will be spotless"". The man takes the monkey home and the monkey cleans for about 20 minutes. The man goes to the bathroom, comes back, and sees the monkey has flung his shit all over the apartment, worsening the apartment's condition.

The next day the angered man goes back to the pet shop, demanding a refund and plans on just getting a cleaning service to get rid of the shit in his apartment. The shopkeeper is deeply sorry and gives the man a llama for free, promising a more successful result. The man goes back to the apartment with the llama, who diligently cleans the shit. The man, satisfied and sure that the llama will finish the rest of the apartment over night, goes to bed. The man wakes up the next morning and there is spit all over the apartment and his belongings are thrown across the floors.

Pissed off at this point, the man storms back to the pet shop. The shopkeeper pleads to give him one more chance, guaranteeing that his prized millipede will do the job. The man takes the millipede back to the apartment. All day the millipede works his behind off cleaning the apartment, not missing a single spot. Around 10 PM the millipede is done, and the man goes to bed, praying nothing to happen overnight.

Nothing does, and the man wakes up the next morning to the millipede's breakfast spread. The man eats the perfect dish of bacon and eggs. He is about to go get the paper when the millipede volunteers to do so. Surprised by the millipede's insistence to help the lazy man, he sits down and watches a movie. Three hours later, the millipede hasn't returned with the paper! The man is worried and curious and peeks out the door to see if the millipede ran for freedom.
