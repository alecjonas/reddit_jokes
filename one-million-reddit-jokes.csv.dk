In a trial, a Texas small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.....ü§†",Lawyers should never ask a Texas grandma a question if they aren't prepared for the answer.,87

The place is busting and seems to be doing well. There are people singing, dancing, and laughing but the first thing he notices is the extremely short person playing piano in the middle of the boisterous crowd. Everyone in the place is infatuated with the peculiar tiny musician. 

He sits down at the counter and asks the bartender: 

‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the deal with the piano player? He must be a foot tall!‚Äô 

The bartender doesn‚Äôt look up from the glassware he‚Äôs polishing. He‚Äôs answered this question many times:

‚ÄòThat‚Äôs Larry. He‚Äôs the house musician.‚Äô

The man, not satisfied with that answer goes on to ask:

‚ÄòWhere the fuck did he come from? He‚Äôs making you a killing!‚Äô 

The bartender leans in close to the man, smiles, and whispers: 

‚ÄòWell, I don‚Äôt tell this to everyone, but you seem like a trustworthy guy.‚Äô

The man leans in closer. 

The bartender nods towards an old dusty beer tap at the end of the bar and explains: 

‚ÄòSee that tap at the end of the bar? It‚Äôs magic.‚Äô

The man leans even closer.

The bartender goes on:

‚ÄòBefore you take a sip of a beer poured from that tap, think of a wish and watch the magic happen. 10 years ago, that‚Äôs how I ended up with Larry and the bar has been a massive success ever since. 

The man looks at the piano player, then turns towards the bartender and looks him dead in the eye:

‚ÄòOne beer please.‚Äô He nods at the old dusty tap. ‚ÄòThat one.‚Äô

The bartender pours his beer. The man thinks of his wish:

‚ÄòI want a million bucks!‚Äô 

He then chugs the beer in one go and slams the glass down on the bar. When he looks up, he‚Äôs surrounded by ducks. A millions of them.

Frustrated, he says to the bartender:

‚ÄòWtf! I wished for a million bucks, not a million ducks!‚Äô

The bartender responds apologetically: 

‚ÄòYeah it‚Äôs not perfect. You really think I would wish for a 12 inch pianist?‚Äô",A man walks into a bar,77

While he's in there, the husband whispers over to his wife: ""Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He's probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain... do whatever he tells you. 

Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you!"" 

His wife responds: ""He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me that he's gay, thinks you're cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you, too!""",A man escapes from a prison where he's been locked up for 15 years.,47

His job was to study different ‚Äúboards‚Äù each containing different sound effects, and he was to pick out the most pleasing and configure them to his preferences.

The first day, Dave went to work and he was directed to a chair in front of an empty desk. The manager then said that he will call up people with FX boards and Dave could pick out the effects. The first group of men were called up. however something was odd. They were dressed up very formally, each carrying a board in their hands. The manager saw Dave‚Äôs puzzled face and explained to him that the men were ex-CIA agents trained in communication supervision, and, because of their hardened training, refuse to take off their suits.

Dave understands as they place the boards in front of him and leave. Dave studied the SFX. He pressed one button.

‚ÄúWoof!‚Äù

A dog‚Äôs bark, Dave wasn‚Äôt entirely interested in the effect. He pressed another one.

‚ÄúBoing!‚Äù

and another one.

‚ÄúClink!‚Äù

^(and another one)

‚ÄúBoom!‚Äù

and he went on, until he finally got to an interesting one.

‚ÄúSmooch!‚Äù

It was a kiss. Dave liked it so much, it amused him to the point where everyday he would call up the men to bring the kiss board over and laugh at it constantly. The manager was confused. 

‚ÄúSay, who is making these sounds?‚Äù asks Dave.

The manager replies, ‚ÄúWell, these are all pre-recorded, but the human ones are made by a man named Joe.‚Äù

Dave laughs again and continues to listen to the ‚Äúsmooch!‚Äù every day, until one day.

When Dave sat down, he ordered the usual kiss board, but, instead of the CIA agents coming in, he was met by a man in casual wear, khakis, t-shirt and such. Dave was puzzled, but he ignored it and pressed the Kiss button again. 

However this time, it was different. The kiss sounded more forced and unnatural. Immediately Dave asked for the CIA agents to bring over another board. He pressed the button, and the new kiss was the same one, satisfying.

The manager applauded and said, ‚ÄúCongratulations, you‚Äôve passed the test.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat test?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe concentration one. I asked another man to bring over a different board with a different pre-recorded kiss to see if you would notice. But how did you know they were different?‚Äù

post,cfavcn,2qh72,jokes,false,1563559248,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cfavcn/the_six_lessons_of_life/,self.jokes,,"**Lesson 1:**

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbor. Before she says a word, Bob says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you $800 to drop that towel.‚Äù After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was Bob the next door neighbor,‚Äù she replies. ‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù the husband says, ‚ÄúDid he say anything about the $800 he owes me?‚Äù

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give each of you just one wish‚Äù ‚ÄúMe first! Me first!‚Äù says the administration clerk. ‚ÄúI want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.‚Äù Poof! She‚Äôs gone. ‚ÄúMe next! Me next!‚Äù says the sales rep. ‚ÄúI want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.‚Äù Poof! He‚Äôs gone. ‚ÄúOK, you‚Äôre up,‚Äù the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, ‚ÄúI want those two back in the office after lunch.‚Äù

*Moral of the story:*

Always let your boss have the first say

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,‚ÄùFather, remember Psalm 129?‚Äù The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, ‚ÄúFather, remember Psalm 129?‚Äù The priest apologized ‚ÄúSorry sister but the flesh is weak.‚Äù Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, ‚ÄúGo forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.‚Äù

*Moral of the story:*

If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ‚ÄùCan I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?‚Äù The crow answered: ‚ÄúSure, why not.‚Äù So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

*Moral of the story:*

To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull ‚ÄúI would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,‚Äù sighed the turkey, but I haven‚Äôt got the energy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you nibble on my droppings?‚Äù replied the bull. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre packed with nutrients.‚Äù The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy
2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend
3. And when you‚Äôre in deep shit, it‚Äôs best to keep your mouth shut!",The Six Lessons of Life,172

She threw the ball and he missed the ball, she then called him a ‚Äúgolfball‚Äù.  He asked her what a golfball was and she told him to go ask the Duty Teacher.

So the little boy runs up to the Duty Teacher and says ‚ÄúMe and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what‚Äôs a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

The Duty Teacher gets angry and sends him to see the Teacher‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

He walks up to the Teacher and says, ‚ÄúToday at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. So, ma‚Äôam, what is a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

Well the Teacher is red in the face and sends him straight to the Principals Office.

The little boy walks in and the Principal is surprised to see him.  He looks across his desk at the little boy and says, ‚ÄúSon, you‚Äôve never before been in trouble or in my office, what is going on?‚Äù

And the little boy says, ‚Äù Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to your office‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ So Mr. Principal, what is a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

The Principal immediately becomes furious and suspends the boy from school and tells him to call his Mother to come and get him.

So they‚Äôre on the car ride home and the Mother looks across the car at the little boy and asks, ‚ÄúWhat happened?  You‚Äôve never done anything like this before‚Ä¶. What is going on?‚Äù

And as they‚Äôre pulling into the driveway the little boy says, ‚Äú Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to the Principals Office and the Principal suspended me and told me to call you to come and get me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶So, Mom‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶.. is a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

The little boy‚Äôs Mother shrieks like a banshee and send him to his room with no supper‚Ä¶..and just wait until your Father gets home!!

So the little boy is laying in his bed, staring at the ceiling, belly rumbling, when he hears the front door open and shut.  Hushed words.  Footsteps down the hall.  And a knock on his bedroom door‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The little boy sits up as his Father walks into the room, sits down next to him on the bed and says, ‚ÄúBoy, what is going on?  Your Mother is beside herself and can barely form the words to tell me what happened today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù

And the little boy says, ‚Äú Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to the Principals Office and the Principal suspended me and told me to call Mom to come and get me, Mom sent me to bed with no supper and told me to wait until you get home‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so, Dad‚Ä¶. What‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶..a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

Leather clears belt loops and the little boy takes a spanking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and Dad leaves the room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The little boy is lying in bed crying and confused‚Ä¶.and decides that he‚Äôs gonna run away.  So he gets his backpack and loads it with his pilfered snacks, his favorite toys and an extra pair of pajamas then slips out his bedroom window into the night.

Walking down the sidewalk later than night the little boy is stopped by a police officer.  The cop looks down and the boy and says, ‚ÄúKiddo, it is waaaay too late for you to be out roaming the streets‚Ä¶ why aren‚Äôt you at home?‚Äù

And the little boy says‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ‚Äú Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to the Principals Office and the Principal suspended me and told me to call Mom to come and get me, Mom sent me to bed with no supper and told me to wait until Dad got home.  Well Dad got home and beat my butt so I ran away‚Ä¶.. so Mr. Officer Sir‚Ä¶. What‚Ä¶..Is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶A‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äôgolfball‚Äù?‚Äù

The little boy is thrown in handcuffs and tossed in the back seat of the cruiser, hauled off to jail to see the judge in the morning‚Ä¶.

In the morning, the little boy is standing behind a table facing a judge in a long black robe.

The Judge looks down at the little boy and asks, ‚ÄúSon, you are far too young to be standing in front of me in my courtroom‚Ä¶.. what have you done?‚Äù

And the little boy says, ‚Äú Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to the Principals Office and the Principal suspended me and told me to call Mom to come and get me, Mom sent me to bed with no supper and told me to wait until Dad got home, well Dad got home and beat my butt so I ran away and got stopped by an Officer who arrested me and threw me in jail.  So Your Honor‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.what‚Ä¶..is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äùgolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS IT!!  LIFE IN PRISON‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ NO PAROLE!!!‚Äù

So the little boy is sitting on his bunk in a prison cell, staring across at the biggest, meanest looking man he‚Äôs ever seen in his life.  When his celly says ,‚ÄùKid, you‚Äôre way too young to be in prison‚Ä¶.what‚Äôd you do, kill someone?‚Äù

And the little boy says, ‚Äú Today at recess me and a little girl were throwing a ball, she threw the ball, I missed the ball and she called me a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô, I asked her what a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô was and she sent me to see the Duty Teacher and the Duty Teacher sent me to see the Teacher and the Teacher got mad and sent me to the Principals Office and the Principal suspended me and told me to call Mom to come and get me, Mom sent me to bed with no supper and told me to wait until Dad got home, well Dad got home and beat my butt so I ran away and got stopped by an Officer who arrested me and threw me in jail.  The next morning I saw the Judge and he sentenced me to Life in prison, with no parole.  So, Mr. Knuckles‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.what is a ‚Äògolfball‚Äô?‚Äù

The big convict comes across that cell in a split second, the little boy scurrying into the corner.  He says, ‚ÄúBoy, I can‚Äôt tell you what I ‚Äúgolfball‚Äô is.‚Äù  He then points through the cell window, ‚ÄúBut do you see that man out there?  All the way across the yard‚Ä¶. Past that first fence‚Ä¶..past all that dirt‚Ä¶..past all them other fences with the razor wire‚Ä¶..That man just standin‚Äô there on the other side of that street in the trenchcoat.‚Äù

The little boy just stares and nods his head.  The celly looks down at him and says, ‚ÄúThat man way over there, on the other side of all those fences‚Ä¶. That man can tell you.‚Äù

So the little boy makes a plan‚Ä¶.and he takes his prison issue plastic spork and he starts digging‚Ä¶and he digs‚Ä¶.and digs‚Ä¶..and digs‚Ä¶.and digs‚Ä¶..and digs.

And finally he pops out on the other side of all those fences and all that razorwire‚Ä¶. And he sees the man in the coat just on the other side of the street.

And the little boy takes of sprinting toward the man‚Ä¶.

&amp;#x200B;

Just then \***BAM**\*

&amp;#x200B;

The little boy is hit by a car‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

One day after coming home he sees her wife in bed, stark naked.
""So my suspicion was right! Where is that bastard?"" he shouts in anger and swiftly rushes to look for him.
He doesn't find anyone but right when he was about to give up, he saw a guy hanging from his balcony.
His face swells up in anger and he starts to beat the living shit out of his hand so he looses grip and falls down from the 5th floor. But the man is determined not to let go. Realising this the husband brings a hammer and literally crushes his finger till he loses grip and falls. But fortunately he falls in a bush and only breaks his leg. Seeing that the man is still alive, he throws his refrigerator from his balcony which crushes the man killing him. But on doing this the cord grips the husband and pulls him down killing him as well.
In heaven the day is extremely busy. God says he will only allow the most gruesome deaths to enter heaven. 
The husband is interviewed. 
"" So my wife was having an affair...."" he starts and narrates the whole story.
"" But then the cord tangles my leg and pulls me with it.""
""If this is not brutal, I don't know what is. You are in."" says God.
The second man comes in.
He says,"" I recently shifted to the sixth floor of an apartment and didn't know they had an open balcony. When I was walking down the terrace,I slipped and feel from there. But fortunately I got hold of the railing of the fifth floor balcony and hung there for almost an hour, after which an angry man stormed in and started crushing my fingers. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, he broke my fingers with a hammer and I fell down into a bush. I broke my leg but was alive. And then when I would've least expected it, a REFRIGERATOR fell on top of me which caused my death.""
""Poor fellow, you may rest in heaven for eternity"" says God.
The third guy sweeps in after him and almost breathless starts to narrate his story.
""Picture this"" he says "" You are hiding in a refrigerator...""",A husband suspects his wife is having an affair.,439

Finally, they went to the fair, and Walter said to Ethel, ""Ethel, you know I'm 87 years old now. If I don't ride that helicopter this year, I may never get another chance."" Once again Ethel replied, ""Walter, you know that helicopter is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

 This time the helicopter pilot overheard the couple's conversation and said, ""Listen, folks, I'll make a deal with you. I'll take both of you for a ride; if you can both stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word I won't charge you! But if you say just one word, it's 50 dollars."" Walter and Ethel agreed and up they went in the helicopter. 

The pilot performed all kinds of fancy moves and tricks, but not a word was said by either Walter or Ethel. The pilot did his death-defying tricks over and over again, but still, there wasn't so much as one word said. When they finally landed, the pilot turned to Walter and said, ""Wow! I've got to hand it to you. I did everything I could to get you to scream or shout out, but you didn't. I'm really impressed!"" Walter replied, ""Well, to be honest, I almost said something when Ethel fell out but, you know, 50 dollars is 50 dollars!""",There was a man named Walter and his Wife Ethel,12156

The parents made sure to tell the babysitter of the bedtime of the girl and of the other information.

Everything was going well, and it came time for the girl to shower before bed. 

The girl said to the babysitter ‚Äúall of my other babysitters shower with me.   Will you shower with me too?‚Äù  Having been warned about this in advance, the babysitter agreed.  In the shower, the girl asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù pointing to the man‚Äôs penis.

After the shower, it was time for the girl to go to bed.  She asked ‚ÄúMy other babysitters always stay with me until I go to sleep.

He had hunted for years and found references in ancient documents that pointed to a hint supposedly at a distant burial ground that he could discern only to be deep in the wilderness of an African jungle. To even get to where he was to the mystical burial site he needed to get to Cairo, Egypt then transfer to a small plane to land at a rural airstrip in the middle of nowhere then get a guide to hike him to a small village where he could get a canoe and go upriver to a place not even on the maps, hike for days and find this ancient burial cave.¬†

There was another reason beyond fame and fortune he wanted to find the Holy Grail.. He had just discovered one other fact.. His nagging cough was not bronchitis, it was cancer. Terminal. He HAD to find the Holy Grail, NO MATTER WHAT.

So he goes through flying to Cairo, charters a small plane, gets a guide from the small airstrip, gets to the village, trades goods for a canoe, and goes entirely off the map to this area of deep wilderness.

He finds the burial grounds and discovers, deep in a cave, a clay pot with a scroll. Translating it he discovers that the Holy Grail is not a gift of immortality, it is four special words spoken by a head monk of a secret convent, passed on from generation to generation over thousands of years, which will give one the necessary holy information to live a long and fruitful life. Four magic words spoken by a monk. But there's a caveat, the monk is only able to give this information on the summer solstice, why not, at sundown from the top of a mountain.. The coordinates of which were described in ancient texts to mysteriously be on the other side of the planet, a place undiscovered at the ancient time of the burial grounds place in history. It was truly divine knowledge.

The Summer Solstice was only one week away! The archeologist had only months to live! He HAD to make it there immediately!

He got in his canoe, fought the river currents, and made it, after two days, to the small village. From there he hired, at a great cost, the same guide that got him back to the airstrip. A pilot happened to be just loading up his small plane, he hitched a ride for a considerable cost and landed in Cairo. From there he booked the first flight to South America.

In Bras√≠lia, the capitol of Brazil, he managed to charter a small plane to a rural airstrip, deep within the jungle. From there he hired a guide to get to a small village where he spent the last of his money begging to buy a canoe from locals that didn't have much use for currency. He went far up river and finally, days after his discovery deep in the jungles of Africa, he comes to the base of the fabled mountain.. Just hours before sunset.

Haggard, unshaven, exhausted and already feeling the impacts of terminal cancer, he takes the first steps up the trail. Suddenly a monk steps out of the brush and says, in perfect English (of course), ""You must be the chosen one.""

""Yes! Yes! I am! I must have the Phrase of the Holy Grail! What is it?!""

The monk replies, ""You must prove your worthiness, by sundown you must reach the top of the hill to receive the phrase which will grant you the gift of how to live. There will be three tests along the way. The first is this one, go into the jungle here and find the Umbuto plant. The fruit of it is deadly.""

The monk reaches behind a tree and hands him a pair of large pruning sheers. Rubber handled, sharp, and something you'd find for $39.99 at Home Depot.

""You will need these throughout your quests. Go, cut the fruit from the tree.""

The archeologist quickly runs off and does so. Upon his return the monk quickly hands it to a native that darts from the foliage and disappears just as fast as he came.

""Cutting those berries was your first task of three. They are now being pummeled down to a poisonous juice which will be placed on the darts of the tribe. If you fail at either of the next two trials you will be stricken by many of these darts and die within moments.""

""Hell"", the archeologist thought to himself, ""I'm dead anyway if I don't get there, so, uh, same difference."" He started off without another word, looking to the lowering sun through the jungle.

""Good Luck!"" the monk yelled after him.
After some time fighting through the thick brush, sweat pouring off his body, fighting the heat and exhaustion, he came upon a deep ravine, some 30 foot across. There was no passing it.

Suddenly, completely neat and clean, not a drop of sweat on his brow, the same monk stepped out of the jungle.

""For your second quest you must build a rope ladder from the vines and cross this treacherous ravine.""

The archeologist takes the sheers and deeply determined, heads off into the jungle. He looks to the lowering sun and jumps into action, cutting vines, tying a rock to one, tossing it over the ravine and after a few hours he's built himself a rickity but passable rope bridge out of the vines.
Running now, sprinting and stumbling his way through the jungle, the sheers over his shoulder, he is almost to the top of the mountain. The sun is dipping below the edge of the horizon.. He must make it there in time!

Suddenly he reaches the top, running, out of breath, he looks around, seeing only a barren rock overlooking the jungle landscape.

From behind a boulder the same monk calmly steps out.

""What's my last quest?!"" The archeologist, haggard, torn shirt, pouring sweat, practically screams at the monk. ""WHAT IS THE LAST QUEST?!""

The monk holds out a simple string, pulled tight, from the thumb and pointer finger of each hand.¬†

""Cut it.""

The sun was now a sliver on the horizon.
""C--C--Cut the--the--String?""

""Yes.""

As the Sun dipped below the horizon the archeologist reached out with the sheers, hands shaking, and SLICE! the string became two, he cut the length of twine.

There was a moment of quiet, the archeologist dropped the sheers to the rock they were standing on.

""You have passed the three quests and have proven yourself worthy.""

""What.. What is the Holy Grail? What are the four words?"" the archeologist stammered out.

""The four words, which will grant you a long and fulfilling life, are these.""

A deathly silence overtook the mountaintop as the light of the day faded over the horizon..

""Don't. Run. With. Scissors.""¬†",A joke I made up years ago and tweaked until I got it to this final form. Open to suggestions on any further changes.,5

Weight Loss Program. 
A guy calls a company and orders their 5-day, 5lbs weight loss program.

The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign around her neck..

She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me.""

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""

He lost 33 lbs that week.",My old man sent me this gem! Had a good laugh,107

He paused and took a swig of his drink.

""I got greedy. So I moved on to a higher value target. I started stealing copper from the Hobgoblins. But it was stressful. The bastards have a good sense of smell, so I had to smear myself with cow-dung before every heist. It's not a pretty sight, and the smell lasts for days.""

""It didn't really take long before I took it even further, and started stealing the silver that the Fairies were digging up to use for their fairy dust.

""So what happened then?"", I inquired.

""Well, I thought it was just going to be one more gig. One last job to make bank. So this time, I targeted the most high value mining operation in the land, but I couldn't go through with it. I had a mental breakdown and turned myself in on the spot.""

His wife asks the same thing she always asks, ‚ÄúHows the sandwich dear?‚Äù 

Every time he would give the same response, ‚ÄúIt tastes fine‚Äù. He would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face. 

His wife thinks maybe its time to switch things up a bit. So the next day, she makes him his normal lunch, only this time, she makes it with ham and cheese, and on wheat bread. She thought surely he will enjoy this! 

The husband enters the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. His wife then asks ‚ÄúHows the sandwich dear?‚Äù

As always, he replies ‚ÄúIt tastes fine‚Äù. He would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face. 

His wife then thinks maybe she needs to offer him more variety. So the next day, she makes him a sandwich, only this time its made with salami, pepperoni, and extra veggies and vinegarette dressing. He walks in the kitchen, takes a bite, and the wife asks ‚ÄúHows the sandwich dear?‚Äù

As always, he replies ‚ÄúIt tastes fine‚Äù and continued eating with a disappointed look on his face.

The next day, as lunch time is getting ready to roll around, his wife was making him lunch. She was furious at the lack of excitement and enjoyment coming from her husband, so she decides shes going to make him the most unique sandwich hes ever had. 

She prepares her italian bread, only this time she toasts it, and almost burns it. She adds random ingredients like peanut butter, peppers and onions, strawberry jam, turkey, ham, corned beef, some olives and some various seasonings. She thought ‚ÄúIf this doesnt get a new reaction out of him, nothing will!‚Äù

The husband walks into the kitchen, takes a seat, and takes a bite of his sandwich. All of a sudden, his eyes widen, and he takes two more bites.

he had no viable skills or accomplishments. He has always dreamed of joining the king‚Äôs army and becoming a knight but was always rejected as he was too short. He would often complain to his friend, Alcott, about his height. He would repeatedly say, ‚ÄúIf only I was taller, I would be able to be a knight.‚Äù   

&amp;#x200B;

One day, a mad scientist overheard Bancroft‚Äôs and Alcott‚Äôs discussion. When he heard Bancroft‚Äôs plea for height, the mad scientist decided to intervene. He introduced himself to the gentlemen, and said he may have a solution to Bancroft‚Äôs ailment. He was working an artificial knee fashioned from various metals: some copper, some brass but mostly iron. The mad scientist claimed this was designed to improve on the human bone which is fragile and weak. He tested it on himself and noticed that aside reducing the chance of injury there were notable positive side effects. He was able to run faster, jump higher and, oddly enough, was around 6 inches taller than before.

&amp;#x200B;

Bancroft did not need much convincing; he, immediately, agreed to the mad scientist‚Äôs proposal and wanted the knees installed right away. Alcott tried to convince Bancroft otherwise, but Bancroft did not care for Alcott‚Äôs plea. He made up his mind and would not have it any other way.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, the mad scientist completed the operation which was a success. Bancroft noticed his physical abilities improved substantially, and he was much taller. With this new found skill set and stature he marched to the king‚Äôs castle and demanded to join the king‚Äôs army. The commander put Bancroft through the initiation test which Bancroft passed with flying colours. The commander was amazed at Bancroft‚Äôs abilities and recruited him right away.

&amp;#x200B;

Bancroft went on for years fighting, defending the honour of the king. He was awarded the greatest honours and never lost a battle. The king, himself, praised Bancroft for his valour and contribution to the nation. Bancroft was finally content, proud of his accomplishments and stronger than ever. He never mentioned his secret weapon to anyone fearing others will undergo the same operation, and then he would lose all the praise.   

&amp;#x200B;

One day Bancroft collapsed while completing his rounds. Another knight determined that Bancroft was, in fact, dead. When doctor was examining Bancroft‚Äôs cold, dead body he noticed the artificial knee has rusted and determined it was likely Tetanus that killed Bancroft. 

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs funny the same object that made him a great warrior was the cause of his demise ‚Äì the iron knee.",Bancroft was an unimpressive man,18

**One day a farmer went happily to his wife and family sharing that their best cow had conceived. Being in an economic stable place they could sell the calf for a small profit.** 

As the weeks passed it became evident that the cow was pregnant with twins. The farmer said to his wife; ""You know I have suddenly had a feeling and impulse that we must dedicate one of these calves to the Lord. We will bring them up together, and when the time comes we will sell one and keep the proceeds, and we will sell the other and give the proceeds to the Lord's work."" 

His wife asked him which he was going to dedicate to the Lord. ""There is no need to bother about that now,"" he replied, ""we will treat them both in the same way, and when the time comes we will do as I say."" And off he went.

In a few months the man entered his kitchen looking very miserable and unhappy. When his wife asked him what was troubling him, he answered, ""I have bad news to give you. The Lord's calf is dead.""

The bartender asks him what he would like to drink. The man stays silent.
The bartender repeats himself, but gets no response from the man.
The bartender is now a bit angered at the man, and says, ‚Äú this isn‚Äôt funny, sir, if you aren‚Äôt going to order you‚Äôre going to have to leave.‚Äù
However, the man doesn‚Äôt even budge.

Fed up with the man, the bartender decides to take a deep breath and just ignore the man.

The man sits there for over three hours, the bartender is impressed, but still very annoyed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you got some place to be?‚Äù The bartender asks the man.

But the man still doesn‚Äôt move.

Soon the bar is about to close, but the man is still there.

The bartender starts to clean the counter before talking to the man one more time.

‚ÄúSir, the joke is over, it‚Äôs been hours and the bar is closing soon, please leave.‚Äù

After about five minutes the man finally looks up and says, ‚ÄúCan I just have a water?‚Äù

The bartender looks at him, now he is very angry, that this man has the nerve to come into his bar, waste his time with his cruel and unfunny joke!

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There once was a man who drove a train for a living...,81

currently, we are still mapping out the future of this civilization, so im unsure of what information i can and cannot share.

The man insistently wants to buy the book although the manager warns him otherwise. At last, the manager agrees to sell him the book, but he warns the man of a curse that will befall him if the last page of the book were to ever be opened.

The man agrees and pays the $1000 then leaves with the book.

When he got home, he decides to leave the book opened on the table of his apartment while he goes and washes up. When he is done, he sees the pages of the book turning towards the end at a fast speed, it was at that point that he realized he forgot to close the windows.

Second man comes up and says he can jump 3 meters high with a running start. Okay, says Hitler, triple his rations and keep him in sound health, we'll need him.

The third one starts thinking, if the first one got double rations for juming 2 meters and the second one triple rations, I'll exaggerate and have plenty of food for myself. So he says I can easily jump over 5 meters. So Hitler says, shoot this one, he can jump over the fence.

Obviously, no one could afford to buy him a real submarine. But he grew up always planning in the back of his mind of how to one day own one.

One day, he decides to make his dream a reality. He finds a broker for submarines and asks how much it would cost. The broker lays out some numbers for him, based on what kind of submarine he might want. John decides to do it, but it takes every cent he has. He has to sell his car, take a second mortgage out on his home, and start working a second job.

He‚Äôs thrilled with his purchase. He spends all the time he can on his submarine, just enjoying that he‚Äôs finally made his dream a reality. But the financial toll begins to be too much on him. The submarine was just way too expensive for him to own.

So he goes to back to his broker and says ‚ÄúLook, this has been a great dream of mine, but I just can‚Äôt make the payments. I‚Äôve already missed one. I can‚Äôt really enjoy the submarine the way I want, I‚Äôm up to my eyeballs in debt, and it‚Äôs causing me way too much stress. I need to sell this submarine.‚Äù

The broker says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir, but I can‚Äôt help you. You need a doctor, not a broker.‚Äù

John is stunned. ‚ÄúA doctor? What do I need a doctor for? You misheard me. I just need to sell this submarine; I don‚Äôt have a health issue.‚Äù

In school i was about 5foot3 to the near end of finishing school and had a short growth spurt but during that time all my friends where like 5foot10 to 6ft and i just felt a bit fucking awkward. In school girls where attracted to taller guys and would discuss this in there little group of friends they had, and i was left out on top of that i was teased more and picked on And i think it was because of my small stature this caused me to become more reclusive and insecure but feeling left out of things bugged me. i think if i was taller like them i would socialise normally also my grades ended bad because of these stupid problems. I mean in school i would notice a pattern the taller guys where more popular and the smaller dudes where discarded like trash, I remember a good looking kid around 5ft5 inches was in my school and he hit on a girl and was rejected, there was nothing Wrong with his personality but the taller ugly guy who sounds stupid gets The girl and I'm like dumbfounded.  Now I'm realising that theres been a study where shorter guys are more likely to kill themselves and have Less incomes and relationships. Its really stupid how one genetic thing can make you more of at disadvantage in life but i try to not let me down. I feel embarrassed being short as its one of the main things for a guy the transition from being a kid to a man, what annoys me is when im out in shops i cant buy beer n shit and they ask me for my ID. Ive noticed when im having conversations no one is interested in what i have to say but when the 5ft9 to 6ft guy starts talking everyone is interested and answers with replies. I remember Trying to get peoples attention to talk to them and being ignored like flat out and when i did they would just tell me to shut up. I remember a girl in my school who pushed into the dinner line once who was like 5foot4 at the time (goodlooking) and popular and i told her what you doing? She turned around Gave me a dirty look called me an fuck ugly midget and laughed with her mate I know it sounds petty but when other dudes did this to guys who where twice my size they would get the fuck outta line with respect.",Shorter guys have harder lives?,1
