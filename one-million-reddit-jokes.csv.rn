The Lawyer ran screaming off into the woods and kept running until he came to a Ranger station. He awoke the Park Ranger inside and told him what happened. The Lawyer and the Ranger went back to the camp site and found the two bears still sitting there. The Ranger noticed one bear was female and the other was a male.

He was buried Friday in one of the biggest funerals in years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, and the Hostess Twinkies.
The graveside was piled high with flours, as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who ""never knew he was kneaded"".
Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a smart cookie, and wasted much of his dough on half-baked schemes.
Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model to millions. Fresh is survived by his second wife. They had two children, and one in the oven.
The funeral was at 3:50 for 20 minutes.",Dough Boy,7

One man walks by and says, ""Listen, I don't have any money to give you but I can write something down on a piece of paper and maybe the next guy who comes by can read it to you.""
The blind man doesn't really want the paper but he says okay anyway and so the man writes something down and puts it in the cup. A little while later, another man walks by and the blind man decides he is curious what's written on the note and says to the man, ""Excuse me, the guy before you put a piece of paper in my cup and I was wondering if you would be willing to read it to me.""
The man agrees to read the note and picks it up out of the cup. He reads it silently to himself first and audibly gasps. He says to the blind man, ""How dare you! You're an awful human being. I can't believe you would write something like this."" Then the man begins to beat up the blind homeless man.
The blind homeless man begins to shout for help and a cop nearby runs over to help him. He asks the blind man what's going on and the man replies, ""I don't know! This man wrote a note and put it in my cup and when this guy read it, he just started beating me up.""
The cop says,"" Alright. Let me see the note. I'll sort this all out."" The cop reads the note and just like the other guy audibly gasps. He then says, ""I'm not sure that this is a crime but this is too terrible to ignore and I'm going to have to take you to jail.""
So he takes the blind man to jail and a few days later, the blind man is in court.
The judge asks what happened and the man explains his story. ""I was just sitting on a corner with a cup when this man put a piece of paper into my cup. When the next guy who passed me read it, he started beating me up and then a cop read it and put me in jail and now I'm here.""
The judge says, ""Don't worry. I'll read the note and sort everything out.""
The judge reads the note and audibly gasps aloud. He then says to the blind man, ""I'm not sure that this is illegal but this is truly too terrible for someone like you to live. I'm going to have to sentence you to the electric chair.""
The blind man is then dragged off to the electric chair and executed. He then feels himself falling down, down, down deeper and deeper until suddenly it begins to get very hot.
The blind man calls out, ""Where am I? What happened?""
A voice responds, ""You may not be too happy to hear this but I'm Lucifer. You're in hell. Now we just need to make sure you really belong here so if you want to explain how you came to be here, I'll make sure you're in the right place and don't belong in heaven.""
So the man explains his story and says, ""I was homeless on a street corner and this man put a piece of paper in my cup. When the next guy read it, he started beating me up, then a cop arrested me, and then a judge sentenced me to the electric chair and I still have no idea why.""
Satan looks at him for a moment and then asks to read the note. Satan reads it and begins to chuckle out loud.
""You definitely belong here,"" he tells the man after reading the note, ""And in fact, there's a very special place for people who are as bad as you.""
So he grabs the man and begins to take him deeper and deeper through the seven layers of hell all the way to the bottom where it begins to get a little cold for some reason.
""I call this the wind tunnel,"" Satan explains,"" This is where I take the worst people who have ever existed. I've only sent about 15 or 20 people through here in all of eternity. It's a giant wind tunnel where you will drift forever all alone and never escape.""
The door opens and the blind man feels a giant gust of wind and by now, he's crying and begging for mercy and pleading that there must be some mistake but Satan just grabs his collar and throws him into the tunnel.
The blind man begins to drift for all eternity and before long any semblance of time passes away and he feels as though he's been drifting for years.
Suddenly, he crashes into someone and grabs hold because it is so rare to see someone else inside the wind tunnel. He asks the man, ""Who is this? Who have I ran into?""
The man replies, ""Vell, you may not vant to hear this but I am known as Adolf Hitler.""
""Wow. Adolf Hitler,"" the man replies, ""I really am with the worst of the worst. Listen, I just have a question for you. When I was alive, I was homeless and I had a cup and a man put a piece of paper in it. When the next guy read it, he beat me up, then a cop arrested me, then a judge sentenced me to the electric chair and then Satan sent me here. Please, can you just read the note for me so I know what it says?""
Hitler responds, ""Sure. If you're going to be here forever, you might as well know why you deserved it."" and agrees to read the note.
The man reaches into his pocket finally ready to hear what the note says, pulls it out and....
it blows away.

It is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable. However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they cannot afford to go a day without it. So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.
Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla. About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""
He sat down and wrote :

One evening huge storm is gathering. The 3 bros reckon spending the night in the car with a lightning storm raging outside is not safe and so look for shelter. 

They finally come across a small farm with a house and a barn. They ask the farmer for shelter for the night, promising not to make any trouble. The farmer accepts on one condition : 
""you may spend the night in the barn, but you are absolutely forbidden to go to the upper level of the barn. My daughters sleep in there and I don't want you to bother them. 

The 3 lads accept and settle in the barn. But the curiosity is too strong and they go have a peek at the girls. The farmer's girls are gorgeous and since they don't have many men around they are more than willing to spend the night with the 3 young men.  

In the morning, the farmer goes into a rage and wakes the 3 boys with his shotgun pointed at them. The 3 friends beg for mercy and the farmer gives them a challenge. 

""You guys will each go into my fields and bring me back 3 of the same fruit, then come back to me and I will see if I spare your life""

The 3 lads depart. Pierre, the lazy type, comes back with 3 grapes. The farmer tells him : 

""I'm going to insert those 3 grapes in your arse, if you talk, scream or even laugh I will kill you. If not, I will let you go"". 

Farmer then proceeds with the 3 grapes without Pierre making a sound. 

Then comes Jake with 3 lemons, the farmer explains : ""I am going to shove those 3 lemons in your arse, if you talk, scream or laugh I will kill you, if you stay silent I will let you go"". 

The first lemon goes as expected. on the second Jake is obiously in pain but keeps silent. 

Then, halfway to the third lemon, Jake bursts into laughter. 

As the farmer is picking up and loading his shotgun, pierre tells Jake : ""dude, what the hell ? you were almost there !! not to say there is NOTHING funny about having a lemon inserted in your butt""

 The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

He calls his cousin who is more than happy to have him over since they haven't seen each other in years.  
When the executive gets there he notices that not much has changed since the last time he was there, a long time ago. He is filled with nostalgia and starts feeling better already.  
They have coffee and chat for a little bit and the executive says he wants to do some farm manual labor to take his head off work and forget about the city life for a while.  
The farmer says there is plenty of work to do around the farm and the executive can help him.
So the farmer tells him to wake up early the next day and meet him at the stable.  
When the executive gets to the stable the next day the farmer shows him piles of bags and say:  
- This is all the horse manure we collected for the past 3 months. Your job will will be to spread it over that empty field to fertilize the soil for the next season.  
Two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.  
The farmer is surprised. ""This usually takes us a whole day! I only planned work for you for tomorrow"".  
So the farmer inspects the field and is astonished the executive did such a good job in so little time. So he tells him to take the rest of the day off and meet him at he chicken coop the next morning.  
The next morning the farmer says: ""We got a big chicken order from one of our clients and we have to deliver it ready for processing. Your job will be to cut the chickens head off so we can send them out.
Again, two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.  The farmer is surprised now even more. He didn't think his city cousin could manage farm jobs so well.  
""This usually takes us two days, this is impressive! Meet me at the orange plantation tomorrow morning.""  
The next morning the farmer says: ""The orange harvesting wasn't very good this year. We only got this 10 boxes of oranges. Your job will be to separate them in 3 piles, big oranges, medium oranges and small oranges. If anyone is bad just discard it.""  
To the farmers surprise, it's the end of the day and his executive cousin is still not back for dinner, so he goes to check on him. When he gets there is sees his cousin working out still on the first box, comparing sizes on two oranges, then picking a third one and changing it's original pile...
The farmer is puzzled, screeching his head. ""what's the matter? I thought you would finish this in no time""  
The executive looks at him and says:
""I'm an executive. We are really good at spreading shit and cutting heads. But we really struggle when it comes to making decisions""

I am now old and unwell, in return for my years of faith to you, would you please send me $100 to prove your existence so I can die knowing I have made the right decisions in my life.'

Of course being addressed to 'God in Heaven' the letter ended up stuck at the post office.  The staff opened the letter and it warmed their hearts so they sent a collection around and managed to come up with $95 and sent it to the old man from 'God'

A week later they got this reply:

'Dear God, thank you for confirming my faith with your generosity, I will put this money to good use in my final days.

He's ready to retire, get a little house in the country for him and the little lady.  Puts an ad on Craigslist ""Bell ringer wanted.  Inquire Quasimodo, Notre Dame.""

Next day, there's a knock at the door.  Quasi opens it, looks out, there's no one there.  Then he hears a voice coming from somewhere down around his knees:

""Excuse me, sir.  Are you Mr. Quasimodo?""

Quasimodo looks down, there's a guy with no arms and no legs.  ""Yes, I'm  Quasimodo.  What do you want?""

The legless, armless guy says ""Ever since I was a boy, I've wanted to be the bell ringer for Notre Dame.  My life has been miserable, but if I could just get this job, I would be the happiest person in all of France.""

Quasimodo looks at him with shock ""Well, I don't see how that's possible.  It's two hundred flights of stairs up to the top of the bell tower, there's a very long rope attached to the bell, and the bell itself weighs 400 pounds.  I don't mean to be rude, but you have no arms or legs!""

The guys looks up at him with tears in his eyes.  ""You don't understand.  This has always been my dream.  My wife is ill.  I have seven children.  I *must* do this!""

Quasimodo feels remorseful.  He gestures toward the stairs and the guy rolls past him.  Using his chin and nose, he begins to climb the stairs.  Two hours later, they reach the bell tower.  The guy lens back and begins rolling furiously toward the rope.  At the very last second, he flexes his waist, bounces over the crevasse, and grabs the rope in his teeth and begins swaying back and forth over the chasm on the rope.  With an amazing manipulation of his teeth and jaw, he begins climbing up the rope until his head is inside the mighty bell.  Still gripping the rope in his teeth, he begins a swaying motion, slowly building momentum.  He hurtles forward and slams into the bell with his head.

*Bong!*, and swinging back to the other side, *Bong!*.  Then again, back to the other side.  *Bong!*.  Then on the fourth *Bong!*, the man loses his grip on the rope, goes flying out of the belfry, and plummets to the pavement hundreds of feet below.

Quasi is stunned!  He races down the two hundred flights of stairs and rushes out into the plaza where dozens of people have gathered.  He elbows his way through the crowd and finally arrives at the center of the circle of humanity.  A gendarme turns to him, gestures at the lifeless, limbless pulp at their feet, and asks...

""Do you know this man?""

""Not really.  But his face rings a bell.""",Quasimodo's had it.,7

Jesus waves him off ""Chill.  Arnold Palmer has done it a hundred times.""  He tees off and the ball goes 175 yards; right into the pond.  Moses sighs, parts the water, and Jesus walks out to pick up the ball.  He gets back and tees up again with the 4-iron.

""Look."" Moses says ""I told you once already; for you, this is a 5-wood *at best*.""

""Nonsense!  I've *seen* Arnold Palmer do it.""  He takes his swing and four seconds later, ball meets water again.

Once more the same routine.  Moses sighs, parts water, Jesus gets ball and tees up.  Moses tells him not to use the 4-iron again.  Jesus says how he was once *with* Arnold Palmer when he did it.  Moses says he's not parting the water a 3rd time.  Jesus shrugs and swings.  Once more, the ball lands in the water.

Moses says ""You're on you're own now, bro"".

I internally shat myself. I still wouldn’t turn around, though. But it was too late, as the chair started turning on it’s own as I tried to resist. The chair wouldn’t budge. First, I saw an ugly, misshapen ear attached to an even uglier misshapen head. Then I saw the mouth, which was covered in what i hope was red lipstick. The nose didn’t have any pimples but was still just as crooked and gross looking as a witch’s nose. Finally, i saw the eyes. HOLY SHIT. The eyes were gone, with just an empty, black abyss in their place. The mouth opened up and I saw gross, completely crooked, dark yellow teeth. I jumped out of my chair and yelled, “HOLY SHIT! I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE! HELP!”.

It yelled at me with a coarse voice.

Before they go in, St. Peter tells them that there's only one room left in heaven at the moment and only the most miserable death will be granted access.

So he asks the first man how he died and the first man says, ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 10th floor apartment, she was lying naked in bed like she had just been having sex. So I checked under the bed and there was no one there. I checked in the closet and there was no one there, so I looked on the balcony and there was some guy hanging from the railing. I got so angry I beat his hands until he fell - but even after 10 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. Then I ran back in the apartment, grabbed the refridgerator, brought it back out, and dropped over the railing right on top of him. Then I was so mad I had a heart attack and died and came here.""

St. Peter said, ""It sounds like you've had it rough"" Then, the next man walks up and says,""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 11th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved. Then this guy starts pounding on my hands until I let go. But again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Finally he goes and dumps this refrigerator on me and I wound up here.""
Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

Then the third guy comes up and is also asked the question. This guy replies, ""I WAS IN THE REFRIGERATOR""",Three dead guys are in line waiting to get into heaven.,11

post,55zr1v,2qh72,jokes,false,1475677996,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/55zr1v/the_whistler/,self.jokes,,"One day in a well known university, a senior professor started his class on a very serious topic. The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name ............. As usual and as expected no one answered.

The professor peacefully kept the pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class ........... Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, ""I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.
(Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy need)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

I've been delivering miracles, was crucified and died for their sins and for the last thousands of years they just want more and more.  What should I do?""  God replies, ""You've been working hard son.  Why don't you go down to Earth and take a vacation.  Come back when you feel better.""  ""Fuckin' Sweet,"" Says Jesus. ""That's probably what I need.  Thanks.""

So Jesus is down on Earth, hitch hiking on the side of a two lane highway.  Eventually a trucker pulls over and Picks him up.  ""Where you headed?""  ""Anywhere you'll take me.  I'm on vacation.""  And down the road they go.

After about a half hour of driving the truckers speaks up, ""Hey man.  I have some water back here if you're thirsty.  I have a little cooler back here filled with ice and it's nice and cold""  ""That sounds great.  I could use a drink."" Responds Jesus.  The trucker reaches behind his seat and pulls out a bottle of water.  Drinks about half of it and passes it to Jesus.  Jesus throws it back drinks the rest.  Jesus says, ""Man that is cold!""  Truck driver just chuckles and says, "" I told you.""  Another 60 miles down the road and the trucker perks up and says, ""You know, before I left my wife made me an egg salad sandwhich.  She makes the best egg salad sandwhiches.  You want half?""  Jesus casually says, ""Sure.  I could eat.""  So the trucker reaches behind his seat into the cooler again, pulls out a sandwhich and rips it in half and hands one half to Jesus.  Jesus takes a bite and looks over at the trucker nodding his head and says, ""That is good!""  Trucker chuckles and says, ""I told you.  My wife makes the best egg sandwhiches.""

Another 80 miles down the road and the trucker inquires, ""Say, I don't know if it's your thing but last week I had a delivery through Kentucky and while I was there I found some Kentucky Bluegrass weed.  You want to share a joint?""  Jesus goes, ""Well, I'm on vacation.  Why not?""  So the trucker lights up a J, takes two big hits and as he passes it to Jesus tells him, ""Be careful. It's strong stuff.""  Jesus takes it and takes a hit.  Then as he's taking in his second hit he realizes how absurd this is.  He turns to the truck driver and says, ""You don't know who I am do you?""  Truck driver says, ""Nope.  Just picked you up off the side of the highway.""  Jesus tells him, ""I am Jesus christ.  The son of god!""  The trucker just replies, ""I told you that was some good shit!""

They take their taxi, book a hotel and sleep for the night. The next morning Gary is awoken by a constant knock. He looks through the peephole and notices a man dressed in kakhis. He opens the door.



""Are ye folks Gary and Bill?"" The man yells, enthused. Gary nods, ""Yep... that would be us."" The ranger nods and makes a check mark on his paper. ""I'm yer safari ranger, George. Yous ready to check out the savannas?"" The duo nods, then George nods, ""Get some clothes on and follow me to the Jeep. I've got snacks.""



After Gary and Bill get ready, they meet George and drive off. Gary, still suffering jet lag, dozes off into a nap. Two hours later the Jeep arrives at their destination. Feeling funny, George taps the brakes, jolting Gary awake.



""What was that for?"" Gary mumbles, dazed. George points out to the fields, and Gary and Bill's eyes widen to a landscape foreign to them, with golden grasses, sparse trees and no shortage of acacia thorns.



The jeep drives within feet of a river, where Gary and Bill set their sights. ""Yous see that in the water?"" George comments, ""Them's hippos. They might look big and cuddly on the outside, but get too close and yer spine'll be cracked in an instant."" Gary and Bill look at each other, wincing a little, then pulling out their cameras to take pictures.



Next up, George drives them near a group of trees. Gary and Bill turn their heads to see giraffes feeding on the leaves. ""Look at that Gary."" Bill comments, snapping more photos. George laughs and puts in his sage advice, ""Even they're aggressive too. You see what these guys'll do just for one lady? They use their necks like giant clubs and fight to be the alpha.""



Finally, to end the first day, George drives the duo to another section of the river, which to their amazement is teeming with all sorts of deer. ""South Africa's got many species of antelope."" George tells them, ""We got wildebeest, kudu, sable, nyala. And it don't even end there. But we can't stay long. These buggers are easy prey."" While snapping more photos, Bill hears rustling behind him. George starts revving the jeep to prepare for the worst. Bill looks around, his eyes widen and his skin turns pale as he hears a growl, and notices spots in the grass. 



""What's wrong, Bill?"" Gary asks, unable to hear the growl drowned out by the engine. Bill stutters for two seconds and finally yells, ""GARY! Behind you, Leopard!""



Gary looks at Bill, thinking very hard, and asks: ""And what's a leop- OH MY GOD!""",[Long] Gary Johnson and Bill Weld are on a trip to South Africa.,0

""The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the animal's body.""

For an example, the professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the cow, withdrew it, and stuck his finger in his mouth.

""Go ahead and do the same thing,"" he told his students.

The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead cow and sucking on it.

When everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and said, ""The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention. Life's tough but it's even tougher if you're stupid.""

While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a rather heavy, not too attractive, older lady walked up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady walked between them into a small room. 

The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. 

Finally the walls opened up again and a beautiful, young woman stepped out. The father, said quietly to his son, ""Go get your Mother"".

St Peter tells them that heaven is almost full and he can only accept one more person and the other two will go to hell. To figure out who will go to heaven, he asks them to tell him how they died, and he will let the man with the best story in. 

So the first man says, ""so I'm at a woman's house, about to sleep with her, when her husband comes home. I jump out the bedroom window and catch onto a balcony. Next thing I know, a man is on the balcony, and he starts hitting my hands with a hammer and I fall. THEN he drops a fridge on me, and I die.""

St Peter turns to the next man who says, ""so I get home from work, and find rose petals strewn about the floor, candles in the living room and a wine bottle on the counter. I just know she is cheating on me and I am pissed so I grab a hammer and go to the room but it's just my wife laying on the bed. So I go to the balcony, and there's this man hanging from the balcony and I want to kill him so I hit him with the hammer until he falls but he's still alive. I go back inside and grab the fridge and drop it on him. Once I'd cooled down, I realized what I'd done and took my own life""

St Peter is quite impressed at this point and turns to the third man who is grinning from ear to ear. 

""So get this, I'm naked... in a fridge!""",Three men die and are speaking to St Peter at the gate,2

Being a helpful guy, Bob tells him there's a new robot in a store down the road that, if you pour your urine into it and insert a dollar bill, it will diagnose any illness that you may have. Hardly believing what he was told, Dave pees into the cup and goes to the store to check it out for himself. Sure enough, there was this robot all new and shiny. So he inserts a dollar bill, and pours his urine into a special receptacle. The robot starts beeping, and seconds later prints out a piece of paper that reads.

""You have a simple sprain. Put a cold compress on your arm and avoid heavy lifting, and your arm will get better in a week""

Dave is amazed at how advanced technology has become, and immediately starts thinking about ways to beat the robot. When he gets home, he shares the news with his wife and daughter and asks them to pee into the cup, to which they happily oblige. He then walks over to the kitty litter box, picks up the poop and places it into the cup with the urine. He then mixes the concoction with tap water and for good measure, beats one off right into the cup. 

The next day he returns to the store, inserts a dollar bill, and pours his entire concoction into the receptacle. After the customary beeps, the robot prints out an even longer piece of paper. It reads:

""1.Your tap water has too much iron. Buy a filter.

2.Your cat has worms. Take it to a vet.

3.Your daughter shoots up heroin. Take her to rehab ASAP.

4.Your wife is pregnant, and you're not the father. Get a good lawyer.

5.And lastly, if you don't stop jerking off, your arm will never get better""",Smart robot,9

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""
